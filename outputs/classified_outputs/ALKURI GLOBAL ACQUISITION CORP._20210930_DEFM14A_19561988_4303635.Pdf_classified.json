        "Section Header": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND THE SPECIAL MEETING",
        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE BUSINESS COMBINATION\nAND THE SPECIAL MEETING\nThe questions and answers below highlight only selected information set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and only briefly address\nsome commonly asked questions about the special meeting and the proposals to be presented at the special meeting, including with respect to the\nproposed Business Combination. The following questions and answers do not include all the information that may be important to Alkuri\nStockholders. Stockholders are urged to carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the other documents\nreferred to herein, to fully understand the proposed Business Combination and the voting procedures for the special meeting.\nQ: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?\nA: Alkuri and Babylon Holdings have agreed to a business combination under the terms of the Merger Agreement that is described in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and Alkuri encourages its\nstockholders to read it in its entirety. Alkuri Stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement,\nwhich, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving corporation in the Business\nCombination and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Babylon, and the other Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See \u201cProposal\nOne\u2014The Business Combination Proposal.\u201d\nQ: Are there any other matters being presented to stockholders at the meeting?\nA: In addition to voting on the Business Combination Proposal, the stockholders of Alkuri will vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the 2021 Plan, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.\nSee the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cProposal Two\u2014The Equity Plan Proposal.\u201d\n\u2022\nto consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, if the parties are not able to\nconsummate the Business Combination for any reason. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cProposal Three\u2014The\nAdjournment Proposal.\u201d\nAlkuri will hold the special meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote upon these proposals. This proxy statement/prospectus contains important\ninformation about the proposed Business Combination and the other matters to be acted upon at the special meeting. Stockholders should read it\ncarefully.\nThe vote of stockholders is important. Regardless of how many shares you own, you are encouraged to vote as soon as possible after carefully\nreviewing this proxy statement/prospectus.\nQ: Why is Alkuri providing stockholders with the opportunity to vote on the Business Combination?\nA: Because the structure of the Transactions involves a merger of Alkuri itself, Alkuri stockholders must be afforded an opportunity to vote on the\nBusiness Combination under Delaware law. Therefore, a stockholder meeting will be held under Delaware law to vote on the Business Combination. In\naddition, pursuant to the SPAC Charter, Alkuri is required to provide stockholders with an opportunity to have their shares of Alkuri Common Stock\nredeemed for cash, either through a stockholder meeting or tender offer. Due to the structure of the Transactions, Alkuri is providing this opportunity\nthrough a stockholder vote. In addition, the Alkuri Stockholders are being asked to vote upon the Equity Plan Proposal.\nviiTable of Contents\nQ: I am an Alkuri Warrant holder. Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?\nA: The Alkuri Warrants will become exercisable following the Business Combination and will entitle holders to purchase Babylon Class A Shares, with the\nnumber of shares and the exercise price adjusted in accordance with the Merger Agreement, as described in more detail herein. This proxy\nstatement/prospectus includes important information about Babylon and the business of Babylon and its subsidiaries following the Closing of the\nBusiness Combination. Because holders of Alkuri Warrants will be entitled to purchase Babylon Class A Shares after the Closing of the Business\nCombination, we urge you to read the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus carefully. Additionally, after the closing of the Business\nCombination, Babylon will have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable under certain scenarios. See \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Babylon may redeem any unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that may be disadvantageous to the holder of such warrants,\nthereby making your warrants worthless.\u201d\nQ: What will happen to Alkuri\u2019s securities upon consummation of the Business Combination?\nA: Alkuri\u2019s units, Alkuri Class A Common Stock and warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbols KURIU, KURI and KURIW, respectively.\nIf Alkuri\u2019s securities cease trading upon consummation of the Business Combination, each share of Alkuri Common Stock will be automatically converted\ninto the right to receive one Babylon Class A Share and the Alkuri Common Stock will cease trading. Each outstanding Alkuri Warrant will be assumed by\nBabylon and automatically converted into a Babylon Warrant. Alkuri\u2019s units will not be listed on Nasdaq following consummation of the Business\nCombination and such units will automatically be separated into their component securities without any action needed to be taken on the part of the\nholders of such units. Babylon intends to apply for listing of the Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants on the NYSE under the proposed\nsymbols \u201cBBLN\u201d and \u201cBBLN.W,\u201d respectively, to be effective upon the consummation of the Business Combination. While trading on the NYSE is\nexpected to begin on the first business day following the consummation of the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that Babylon\u2019s\nsecurities will be listed on the NYSE or that a viable and active trading market will develop. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Babylon\u2019s Business and\nOperations Following the Business Combination\u201d for more information.\nQ: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination?\nA: Due to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition\ncompanies and the risk that similar levels of redemptions could occur in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination is not\nexpected to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction, including as a \u201creorganization\u201d under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that is the\ncase, holders of Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants will generally be treated as if they sold their Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants in a\ntaxable transaction and will be taxable on the receipt of the Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants in the Business Combination.\nNo ruling has been requested, nor is one intended to be requested, from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business\nCombination. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination is subject to both legal and factual uncertainty, is not free from doubt,\nand may change depending on the actual level of redemptions that occur in connection with the Business Combination. No opinion of counsel has or will\nbe provided regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Consequently, no assurance can be given whether the IRS will\nassert, or that a court would sustain, a position contrary to that described above.\nFor additional information, please read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.\u201d The tax consequences to you of the\nBusiness Combination will depend on your particular facts and circumstances. Please consult your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the\nBusiness Combination in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other\ntax laws.\nviii\nTable of Contents\nQ: How will voting rights be allocated among holders of Babylon Class A shares and Babylon Class B Shares?\nA: The Babylon Articles provide for a dual class share capital structure, as a result of which holders of Babylon Class B Shares will be entitled to 15 votes\nper share, while holders of Babylon Class A Shares will be entitled to one vote per share. This will provide holders of Babylon Class B Shares with\nsignificant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and significant corporate transactions,\nsuch as a merger or other sale of Babylon or its assets. Upon the Closing, the Founder will hold all of the issued and outstanding Babylon Class B\nShares, including the Stockholder Earnout Shares. Our Founder may in certain circumstances have sufficient voting control over Babylon to amend\nBabylon\u2019s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights attached to Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder\nterminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control of Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights\ndescribed in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon.\nThe Alkuri board of directors considered the risk of concentrating voting control in the dual class share structure (with \u201csuper-voting\u201d rights for the\nFounder), but determined that they were outweighed by the long-term benefits that a founder-controlled company would provide to Alkuri Stockholders\nand future shareholders of Babylon after Closing. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Operating\nas a Public Company\u2014The dual class structure of our ordinary shares has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Founder, which will limit\nyour ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control\u201d for more information.\nQ: What equity stake will Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders and the existing Babylon Holdings\u2019 shareholders hold in Babylon immediately after the\nconsummation of the Business Combination?\nA: Immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination, it is anticipated that: (i) Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of\nthe Babylon Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the\nvoting power of Babylon\u037e (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor\nEarnout Shares) and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the\nBabylon Shares and 95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of\nBabylon being held by the Founder). These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will\nremain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination, (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with\nrespect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing\nalso excludes shares being purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and\nits affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of\nBabylon assuming no redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum\nredemptions.\nQ: If I am a public unit holder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my public units?\nA: No. Holders of outstanding units must separate the underlying public shares and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to\nthe public shares.\nIf you hold units registered in your own name, in order to redeem your underlying shares you must deliver the certificate for such units to Continental\nStock Transfer & Trust Company, Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent, with written instructions to separate such units into public shares and public warrants. This\nmust be completed far enough in advance to permit the mailing of the public share certificates back to you so that you may then exercise your redemption\nrights with respect to the public shares.\ni\nx\nTable of Contents\nIf a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee holds your units, you must instruct such nominee to separate your units. Your\nnominee must send written instructions by facsimile to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent. Such written instructions\nmust include the number of units to be split and the nominee holding such units. Your nominee must also initiate electronically, using DTC\u2019s deposit\nwithdrawal at custodian (DWAC) system, a withdrawal of the relevant units and a deposit of an equal number of public shares and public warrants. This\nmust be completed far enough in advance to permit your nominee to exercise your redemption rights with respect to the public shares upon the\nseparation of the public shares from the units. While this is typically done electronically the same business day, you should allow at least one full\nbusiness day to accomplish the separation. If you fail to cause your public shares to be separated in a timely manner, you will likely not be able to\nexercise your redemption rights.\nQ: Why is Alkuri proposing the Business Combination?\nA: Alkuri was organized to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or\nentities.\nOn February 9, 2021, Alkuri completed its initial public offering of units, with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-\nfourth of one Alkuri Warrant, raising total gross proceeds of approximately $345,000,000 (including $45,000,000 in gross proceeds from the underwriters\u2019\nexercise of their over-allotment option in full). Since the Alkuri IPO, Alkuri\u2019s activity has been limited to the evaluation of business combination\ncandidates.\nAlkuri\u2019s management believes Babylon is an exciting company with an appealing market opportunity and growth profile, a strong position in its industry\nand a compelling valuation. As a result, Alkuri believes that the Business Combination will provide Alkuri Stockholders with an opportunity to participate\nin the ownership of a company with significant growth potential. See the section entitled \u201cProposal One\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Alkuri\u2019s\nReasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors.\u201d\nQ: What is the \u201cPIPE Investment\u201d?\nA: Concurrently with and following the execution of the Merger Agreement, Babylon Holdings entered into Subscription Agreements with certain parties\nsubscribing for Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to which such PIPE Investors have agreed to purchase, and Babylon Holdings has agreed to sell them,\nan aggregate of 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and at an aggregate purchase price of $230 million subject to\ncertain conditions set forth therein. This PIPE Investment is expected to close immediately prior to the Business Combination.\nQ: Did Alkuri\u2019s board of directors obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business\nCombination?\nA: No. Alkuri\u2019s board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business\nCombination. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors and its advisors in valuing Babylon Holdings\nand will be assuming the risk that the Alkuri board may not have properly valued the business. However, Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors have substantial\nexperience in evaluating the operating and financial merits of companies from a wide range of industries and have substantial experience with mergers and\nacquisitions. Furthermore, in analyzing the Business Combination, Alkuri\u2019s officers and advisors conducted significant due diligence on Babylon\nHoldings. Alkuri also received advice from the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO, acting in their capacity as financial advisor to Alkuri, as to the valuation of\nBabylon Holdings implied by the Transactions and how that valuation compared to peers. In addition, Alkuri also engaged several professional advisors\nto assist it in connection with evaluating Babylon Holdings, including Moss Adams LLP (who provided advice on financial, tax and accounting matters)\nand Barrington Advisory Group (who provided advice on strategic, process and financial matters). The experience of, and work performed by, Alkuri\u2019s\nmanagement team and external advisors, and the commitments\nx\nTable of Contents\nobtained in respect of the PIPE Investment by sophisticated third-party investors at the valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings by Alkuri, provided\nadditional comfort with respect to the valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings by Alkuri. Accordingly, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors concluded that its\nmembers\u2019 collective experience and backgrounds, together with the experience and sector expertise of Alkuri\u2019s officers and advisors, enabled it to make\nthe necessary analyses and determinations regarding the Business Combination, including that the Business Combination was fair from a financial\nperspective to its stockholders and that Babylon\u2019s fair market value was at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred\nunderwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Business Combination.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that Alkuri\u2019s board of directors was correct in its assessment of the Business Combination. For a complete\ndiscussion of the factors utilized by Alkuri\u2019s board of directors in approving the Business Combination, see the sections entitled \u201cProposal One\u2014The\nBusiness Combination Proposal\u2014The Background of the Business Combination\u201d and \u201cProposal One\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Alkuri\u2019s\nReasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors.\u201d\nQ: Do I have redemption rights?\nA: If you are a holder of Alkuri public shares, you have the right to demand that Alkuri redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the cash held in\nAlkuri\u2019s trust account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. We sometimes refer to these rights\nto demand redemption of the Alkuri public shares as \u201credemption rights.\u201d\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of Alkuri public shares, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom such holder is acting in\nconcert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more\nof Alkuri public shares. Accordingly, all Alkuri public shares in excess of 15% held by a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such holder or\nany other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup,\u201d will not be converted.\nUnder the SPAC Charter, the Business Combination may not be consummated if Alkuri has net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001 either immediately\nprior to or upon consummation of the Business Combination after taking into account the redemption for cash of all Alkuri public shares properly\ndemanded to be redeemed by holders of Alkuri public shares.\nQ: How do I exercise my redemption rights?\nA: A holder of public shares may exercise redemption rights regardless of whether it votes for or against the Business Combination Proposal or does not\nvote on such proposal at all, or if it is a holder of Alkuri public shares on the record date. If you are a holder of Alkuri public shares and wish to exercise\nyour redemption rights, you must demand that Alkuri convert your Alkuri public shares into cash and deliver your Alkuri public shares to Alkuri\u2019s\ntransfer agent physically or electronically using The Depository Trust Company\u2019s Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (\u201cDWAC\u201d) System no later than two\n(2) business days prior to the special meeting. Any holder of Alkuri public shares seeking redemption will be entitled to a full pro rata portion of the\namount then in the trust account (which, for illustrative purposes, was $345,022,618, or $10.00 per share, as of the record date), less any owed but unpaid\ntaxes on the funds in the trust account. Such amount will be paid promptly upon consummation of the Business Combination. There are currently no\nowed but unpaid income taxes on the funds in the trust account.\nAny request for redemption, once made by a holder of Alkuri public shares, may be withdrawn at any time prior to the time the vote is taken with respect\nto the Business Combination Proposal at the special meeting. If you deliver your shares for redemption to Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent and later decide prior to\nthe special meeting not to elect redemption, you may request that Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make\nsuch request by contacting Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent at the address listed at the end of this section.\nx\ni\nTable of Contents\nAny written demand of redemption rights must be received by Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent at least two (2) business days prior to the vote taken on the\nBusiness Combination Proposal at the special meeting. No demand for redemption will be honored unless the holder\u2019s stock has been delivered (either\nphysically or electronically) to the transfer agent.\nIf you are a holder of Alkuri public shares (including through the ownership of Alkuri units) and you exercise your redemption rights, it will not result in\nthe loss of any Alkuri Warrants that you may hold (including those contained in any units you hold). Your whole warrants will become exercisable to\npurchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of the Business Combination.\nQ: Do I have appraisal rights if I object to the proposed Business Combination?\nA: Under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants will not have\nappraisal rights in connection with the Business Combination.\nQ: What happens to the funds deposited in the trust account after consummation of the Business Combination?\nA: The net proceeds of the Alkuri IPO of $345.0 million, inclusive of the amount raised from the simultaneous private placement of Alkuri Warrants for\n$8.9 million, were placed in the trust account immediately following the Alkuri IPO. After consummation of the Business Combination, the funds in the\ntrust account will be used to pay, on a pro rata basis, holders of Alkuri public shares who exercise redemption rights, to pay fees and expenses incurred in\nconnection with the Business Combination (including aggregate fees of approximately $12.1 million to the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO as deferred\nunderwriting commissions). Any proceeds from the trust account which are not required to be used in order to satisfy redemption rights or the fees and\nexpenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination will be made available to Babylon for use in the conduct of its business (whether for\nworking capital purposes or otherwise).\nQ: What happens if a substantial number of public stockholders vote in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and exercise their redemption\nrights?\nA: Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders may vote in favor of the Business Combination and still exercise their redemption rights, although they are not required to\nvote in any way to exercise such redemption rights. Accordingly, the Business Combination may be consummated even though the funds available from\nthe trust account and the number of public stockholders are substantially reduced as a result of redemptions by public stockholders.\nHowever, the Business Combination will not be consummated if the levels of redemption give rise to a failure of a condition to closing of the Business\nCombination that is not waived. Such conditions to closing may include Alkuri\u2019s obligation to deliver cash proceeds (whether derived from the PIPE\nInvestment or the trust account) of at least $230 million and the requirement under the SPAC Charter and the Merger Agreement that Alkuri shall not have\nless than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act) either immediately prior to or upon\nconsummation of the Transactions.\nIn the event such conditions to Closing are satisfied or waived, redemptions may result in fewer Alkuri public shares and public stockholders. In such\nevent, the trading market for Babylon Shares may be less liquid than the market was for Alkuri prior to the consummation of the Transactions, which may\nresult in adverse consequences such as depressed trading value and Babylon\u2019s inability to meet the listing standards of a national securities exchange. In\naddition, to the extent of any redemptions, fewer funds from the trust account would be available to Babylon to be used in its business following the\nconsummation of the Business Combination.\nxii\nTable of Contents\nQ: What happens if the Business Combination is not consummated?\nA: If Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings for whatever reason, Alkuri would search for another target business\nwith which to complete a business combination. If Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business\ncombination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter), Alkuri must\nredeem 100% of the outstanding Alkuri public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to an amount then held in the trust account (net of taxes\npayable and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of outstanding Alkuri public shares. The Sponsor and\nAlkuri\u2019s officers and directors have waived their redemption rights with respect to their Sponsor Shares in the event a business combination is not\neffected in the required time period, and, accordingly, their Sponsor Shares will be worthless. Additionally, in the event of such liquidation, there will be\nno distribution with respect to our outstanding warrants. Accordingly, the Alkuri Warrants will expire worthless.\nQ: How do the Sponsor and the officers and directors of Alkuri intend to vote on the proposals?\nA: The Sponsor, as well as Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors, beneficially own and are entitled to vote an aggregate of approximately 20% of the outstanding\nAlkuri Common Stock. These holders have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Business Combination Proposal. These holders have also indicated\nthat they intend to vote their shares in favor of all other proposals being presented at the meeting. In addition to the shares of Alkuri Common Stock held\nby the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors, Alkuri would need 12,937,501 shares, or approximately 37.5%, of the 34,500,000 Alkuri public shares\nsold in the Alkuri IPO to be voted in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and other proposals in order for them to be approved (assuming all\noutstanding shares are voted on each proposal).\nQ: What interests do the Sponsor and the current officers and directors of Alkuri have in the Business Combination?\nA: In considering the recommendation of our board to vote in favor of the Business Combination, stockholders should be aware that, aside from their\ninterests as stockholders, the Sponsor and certain of our directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that are different from, or in\naddition to, those of other stockholders generally. Our directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the\nBusiness Combination, in recommending to stockholders that they approve the Business Combination and in agreeing to vote their shares in favor of the\nBusiness Combination. Stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Business Combination. These interests\ninclude, among other things, the fact that:\n\u2022\nIf the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as\nmay be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of the\noutstanding Alkuri public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of directors, dissolving\nand liquidating. In such event, the Sponsor Shares held by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and officers, which were acquired for an\naggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to participate in any\nredemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based upon the closing\nprice of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each\noutstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private placement warrant. This purchase took place\non a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these\npurchases were placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of\nxiii\nTable of Contents\n$8,484,666 based upon the closing price of $1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock\nunderlying the private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on\nNasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private placement warrants and Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants\nwill become worthless if Alkuri does not consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved\nby Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each\noutstanding whole warrant will become a Babylon Warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of\nthe Business Combination and each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to\nthe Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s initial stockholders and owners of private placement warrants paid significantly less for their shares and warrants than other current\nstockholders and holders of warrants paid for their shares and warrants purchased in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market thereafter. Prior to\nthe consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or\napproximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s IPO and the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 over-\nallotment option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of which entitles the holder\nto purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per warrant. Each\noutstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a target value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00. If\nthe Business Combination is consummated, based on the difference in the purchase price of $0.003 per share that the Sponsor paid for the\nSponsor Shares, as compared to the purchase price of $10.00 per Unit sold in the IPO, these initial stockholders and holders of private\nplacement warrants will be able, at a lower price per share of Babylon Class A Common Stock, to recognize a greater return on their\ninvestment than stockholders or holders of warrants that purchased Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri warrants in the Alkuri IPO or in the\nopen market thereafter. Furthermore, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return even if the share price of the Babylon Shares after the\nClosing falls below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Alkuri Stockholders may experience a negative rate of return\nfollowing the Closing of the Business Combination.\n\u2022\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, of the 7,187,500 Sponsor Shares that will be converted into 7,187,500 Babylon Class A shares at\nClosing, 1,293,750 shares (which we refer to herein as the Sponsor Earnout Shares) will be subject to restrictions if and until milestones\nbased on the achievement of certain price targets of Babylon Class A following the Closing are met.

Upon consummation of the\nforegoing, Alkuri will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Babylon (formerly Babylon Holdings).\nThe following diagrams illustrate in simplified terms the current structure of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings and the expected structure of\nBabylon (formerly Babylon Holdings) upon the Closing.\nSimplified Post-Business Combination Structure\n3\nTable of Contents\nMerger Consideration\u037e Reclassification\nThe Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion, and prior to\nthe Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby (i) each outstanding Babylon Holdings G1 Share will be reclassified as Babylon\nHoldings Class B shares, (ii) each outstanding Babylon Holdings Class B Share and Babylon Holdings Class C Share will be reclassified into\nBabylon Class A Shares, and (iii) each outstanding Babylon Holdings Class A Share will be reclassified into Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of\nthe Reclassification, each outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination\nof $10.00 (based on the $3.515 billion equity value of Babylon Holdings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder.\nThe Babylon Class B Shares will have the same economic terms as the Babylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes\nper share (while each Babylon Class A Share will have one vote per share). See \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2013Reclassification.\u201d\nEarnout\nIn addition, in connection with the Closing, Babylon will issue at the Closing the Stockholder Earnout Shares and the Sponsor Earnout Shares.\nThe Stockholder Earnout Shares and the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be subject to restrictions linked to milestones (based on the achievement of\ncertain price targets of Babylon Class A Shares following the Closing) as further described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2013\nEarnout.\u201d The Sponsor and the Founder will each immediately become the legal and beneficial owner of their respective Earnout Shares at the\nClosing, but they will be subject to transfer restrictions and subject to the restrictions based on milestone requirements. While the Earnout Shares\nremain outstanding, they shall have all the rights and privileges with respect to Class A Shares for the Sponsor Earnout Shares and Class B Shares\nfor the Stockholder Earnout Shares (including the right to vote such shares and certain rights to receive on a current basis cash dividends or other\ndistributions made with respect to such shares). In the event such milestones are not met, all of the Earnout Shares will be automatically converted\ninto redeemable shares of Babylon which Babylon can redeem for an aggregate consideration of $1.00.\nImmediately following the Closing, the Founder will hold 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of the\noutstanding ordinary shares of Babylon. As such, we will be eligible to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance\nrules of the NYSE. However, we have elected not to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption.\nOwnership of Babylon after the Business Combination\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the\nBabylon Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the\nvoting power of Babylon\u037e (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor\nEarnout Shares) and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the\nBabylon Shares and 95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of\nBabylon being held by the Founder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will\nremain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination: (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with\nrespect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The\nforegoing also excludes shares being purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by\nthe Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of\nthe voting power of Babylon assuming no redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon\nassuming maximum redemptions.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe Alkuri Board\u2019s Reasons for the Business Combination\nIn evaluating the Business Combination, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors consulted with Alkuri\u2019s management and legal and financial advisors.\nAlkuri\u2019s board of directors reviewed various industry and financial data in order to determine that the consideration to be paid was reasonable and\nthat the Business Combination was in the best interests of Alkuri Stockholders. The financial data reviewed included the historical and projected\nconsolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings, comparable publicly traded company analyses and an analysis of pro forma capital structure\nand trading multiples prepared by management and Alkuri\u2019s advisors.\nAlkuri\u2019s management conducted a due diligence review of Babylon Holdings that included an industry analysis, an analysis of the existing\nbusiness model of Babylon Holdings and historical and projected financial results. Alkuri\u2019s management, including its directors and advisors, have\nmany years of experience in both operational management and investment and financial management and analysis and, in the opinion of Alkuri\u2019s\nboard of directors, were suitably qualified to conduct the due diligence and other investigations and analyses required in connection with the search\nfor a business combination partner. A detailed description of the experience of Alkuri\u2019s executive officers and directors is included in the section of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cAlkuri\u2019s Business\u2014Directors and Executive Officers.\u201d\nIn reaching its unanimous resolution (i) that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the proposed Business\nCombination, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Alkuri and its stockholders and (ii) to recommend that its stockholders adopt and\napprove the Merger Agreement and approve the Business Combination contemplated therein, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors considered a range of\nfactors, including but not limited to, the factors discussed below. In light of the number and wide variety of factors, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors did\nnot consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its\ndetermination. Alkuri\u2019s board of directors viewed its position as being based on all of the information available and the factors presented to and\nconsidered by it. In addition, individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. This explanation of Alkuri\u2019s reasons for the\nBusiness Combination and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the\nfactors discussed under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIn considering the Business Combination, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors gave considerable weight to the following factors:\n\u2022\nVisionary Founder and World Class Management Team. Dr. Ali Parsadoust and the Babylon Holdings management team have a deep\nunderstanding of both their direct customers (payer entities) and end users (network participants) and, with over a century of collective\nexperience in healthcare and technology, have the drive and competency to grow the business and provide healthcare in a manner that\nimproves the end user\u2019s experience and reduces costs for its customers. Importantly, in a space like healthcare, with large and\nentrenched incumbents and relatively high barriers to entry, Alkuri believes it is critical to combine the experience, competency and\ndrive of a qualified and accomplished management team like Babylon Holdings\u2019 with a proven entrepreneurial leader like Dr. Ali\nParsadoust, who brings a bold vision to drive change in the segment using technology and a customer-focused approach. Dr. Ali\nParsadoust built the first private company to run a U.K. National Health Service (the \u201cNHS\u201d) hospital, Circle Health, which then became\nEurope\u2019s largest partnership of clinicians before going public in 2012. Dr. Ali Parsadoust has been named by The Times among the 100\nglobal people to watch, and by the Health Service Journal among the 100 most influential people in U.K. healthcare.\n\u2022\nLarge market opportunity. The $10 trillion global healthcare market, is expected to grow over the coming decades and there is a clear\nneed for accessibility, quality and affordability. Alkuri also believes that the market is early in its adoption of technology, even in large\neconomies like the United States. To date, Babylon Holdings has deployed its technology in 16 countries (Malaysia, Indonesia,\n5\nTable of Contents\nHong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Canada, the United States,\nRwanda and the United Kingdom) and actively provides clinical services in three (the United States, the United Kingdom and Rwanda).\nBabylon Holdings is focused on developing its technology and growing its existing market in the United States, which represents an\nalmost $4 trillion healthcare market opportunity, while also planting roots in new geographical markets.\n\u2022\nDisruptors. Babylon Holdings is paving the way in the digital transformation of healthcare. By reengineering the healthcare value\nchange and balancing accessibility, affordability and quality, Babylon Holdings is using its technology platform to connect users to\nclinical experts and provide virtual care, in-person medical care and post-care offerings. In Alkuri\u2019s view, Babylon Holdings is unique in\napplying a mobile native, digital-first approach at scale to proactive and preventative end-to-end healthcare, which disrupts the\ntraditional in-person, reactive, \u201csick care\u201d model that is prevalent in health systems around the world. As evidenced by other market\nsegments like retail and entertainment, Alkuri believes that digital-first platforms and products that are well-aligned to the changing\nneeds of its customers can demonstrate more rapid growth, claim significant market share, and deliver the potential for outsized returns\nrelative to their physical-first peers. As a digital-first disruptor that breaks the mold of a system dominated by clinic- and physical-first\ncompetitors, Alkuri believes Babylon Holdings represents a similar potential opportunity in the healthcare segment, as evidenced in\nparticular by its accelerated growth in the United States over the past year. For example, the median growth rate for 2019, 2020 and\nexpected 2021 revenue for three telemedicine companies (Teladoc Health Inc., American Well Corporation and 1Life Healthcare, Inc.\n(One Medical)), three integrated care companies (Oak Street Health, Inc., Signify Health Inc. and Accolade, Inc.) (collectively, the\n\u201cSelected Peer Companies\u201d) was roughly 40% per year, based on publicly available information, including public filings, while the\nBabylon Holdings revenue growth rate for the same period is over 300% per year.\n\u2022\nNext generation technology. Babylon Holdings\u2019 artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) architecture and fully integrated technology platform is\ndesigned to help its members navigate their deeply-personal healthcare journeys. Babylon Holdings\u2019 AI has been designed with a\nfocus on delivering insights and efficiencies to members and clinicians. The AI\u2019s core features include: interpretability and\nexplainability to provide a layer of transparency over insights and, efficiencies, quantification on uncertainty providing for less\nuncertainty and more accurate predictions, data efficiency and flexibility enabling Babylon to adapt to multiple sources of information\nand consider latest clinical guidelines, public studies and multiple sources of medical knowledge. In addition, unlike many of its peers\nwhich either focus on bringing patients into their clinics or provide a single solution like fee-based telemedicine consultations, the\nbroader technology platform is designed to help manage the end-to-end care for a member, and represents what Alkuri believes is the\ncutting edge of digital-first healthcare and a multi-year advantage over \u201ctechnology enabled\u201d industry incumbents and others seeking\nto enter the market.\n\u2022\nScalable, durable business model. Babylon Holdings\u2019 digital-first model is highly scalable and enables it to deliver fully-integrated,\npersonalized healthcare across the entire care spectrum through mobile devices the vast majority of individuals in Babylon Holdings\u2019\ntarget markets already own or access. Alkuri expects healthcare spending to continue rising globally as the population in key markets\nlike the United States continue to age, and Alkuri believes durable secular industry trends toward digital solutions as well as value-\nbased care will continue to drive adoption of digital healthcare services like those offered by Babylon Holdings. Babylon Holdings has\nshown an ability to find market fit and rapidly scale both its software licensing services and value-based care services, yet the 24\nmillion members served by Babylon Holdings represent a small fraction of the total addressable market. Alkuri believes Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 technology advantages can enable it to grow revenues on a rate basis faster than its peers, as it has for multiple years, by\nexpanding the covered population and scope of services in its existing markets and customers, expanding to new markets with new and\nexisting customers,\n6\nTable of Contents\npursuing strategic partnership and inorganic growth through acquisitions and continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure to\nimprove capabilities.\n\u2022\nConsumer and Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) go-to-market characteristics. While in many cases the contracted customers of the\nBabylon Holdings service will be a corporate entity like an insurance company, we believe that developing a strong consumer brand\nand deep consumer relationships represents a significant opportunity for Babylon Holdings over time. Alkuri believes a unique\ncharacteristic of the Babylon Holdings model is that, unlike most traditional \u201csick care\u201d systems in healthcare, which generally reward\nexpensive and episodic emergency care, Babylon Holdings\u2019 business and gross margin can actually improve as more members engage\nwith the product, provide data to enable preventative care, and avoid costly urgent care, emergency room and hospital visits. Alkuri\nexpects that building strong direct relationships and brand equity with Babylon Holdings\u2019 consumer members can create both\nsignificant potential bottom-line improvements and retentive capacity for its payer clients and contracts while enhancing Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 overall market position and ability to differentiate itself from its competitors. Alkuri\u2019s management\u2019s deep expertise in scaling\nconsumer brands, business models and products, particularly in mobile, by using digital marketing strategies and technology-enabled\nsalesforces to help scale businesses may be instrumental in helping Babylon Holdings reach new customers and end users, and to\nbuild a differentiated brand positioning and awareness in a market that we believe is lacking in strong consumer-oriented brands.\n\u2022\nOrganic and inorganic growth potential. Babylon Holdings has experienced robust growth in its early stages yet Alkuri sees\nsignificant addressable market expansion opportunities, with potential expansion in the United States and other new geographies, as\nwell as potential opportunities for inorganic growth through acquisitions. Notably, the potential for market expansion and inorganic\ngrowth is not contemplated in the current growth projections of Babylon Holdings.\n\u2022\nDefensible market position. The healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we\noperate are highly competitive, however most of Babylon Holdings\u2019 competitors are generally focused on one specific slice of the\nhealthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine), or are limited to specific and smaller\ngeographic ranges due to their reliance on operating owned physical locations, rather than delivering the entire healthcare needs of a\nmember on a national or even global basis. Babylon Holdings has developed a digital platform and business model that Alkuri believes\nwill be difficult for other companies in the healthcare and traditional fee-for-service space to emulate.\n\u2022\nAttractive Valuation. The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon\nHoldings at $3.515 billion (or 5.1x projected 2022E revenues of $710 million), which represents a sizeable discount to public trading\nmarket valuations of comparable companies across digital and telehealth industries and digitally enabled healthcare providers. The set\nof comparable companies to Babylon Holdings was selected based on the existing universe of publicly traded companies at the time of\nthe transaction. Additionally, the valuation discount is relative to companies that are growing at lower rates than Babylon Holdings.\nAdjusting for Babylon Holdings\u2019 accelerated growth resulted in the valuation range representing an even more sizeable discount to its\npeers, which we believe positions the Business Combination as an attractive opportunity for Alkuri Stockholders.\nAlkuri\u2019s board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business\nCombination, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nPotential Inability to Complete the Merger. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility that the Business Combination\nmay not be completed and the potential adverse consequences to Alkuri if the Business Combination is not completed, in particular the\nexpenditure of time and resources in\n7\nTable of Contents\npursuit of the Business Combination and the loss of the opportunity to participate in the transaction. They considered the uncertainty\nrelated to factors outside of the control of the parties to the transaction. The Business Combination Agreement also includes an\nexclusivity provision that prohibits Alkuri from soliciting other initial business combination proposals, which restricts Alkuri\u2019s ability\nto consider other potential initial business combinations until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement or the\nconsummation of the Business Combination.\n\u2022\nThe Risk that Alkuri\u2019s Public Stockholders Would Vote Against the Business Combination Proposal or Exercise Their Redemption\nRights. The Alkuri board of directors considered the risk that some of the current public stockholders would vote against the Business\nCombination proposal or decide to exercise their redemption rights, thereby depleting the amount of cash available in the trust account\nto an amount below the minimum required to consummate the Business Combination. Further, the fact that public stockholders may\nvote for the Business Combination proposal while also exercising their redemption rights mitigates against any incentive a public\nstockholder might have to vote against the Business Combination proposal, especially to the extent that they hold public warrants\nwhich would be worthless if the Business Combination is not completed.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 Business Risks. The Babylon Holdings board of directors considered that Babylon Stockholders would be subject\nto the execution risks associated with Babylon Holdings if they retained their public shares following the Closing, which were different\nfrom the risks related to holding public shares of Alkuri prior to the Closing. In this regard, the Alkuri board of directors considered that\nthere were risks associated with successful implementation of Babylon Holdings\u2019 long term business plan and strategy and Babylon\nHoldings realizing the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination on the timeline expected or at all. The Alkuri board of directors\nconsidered that the failure of any of these activities to be completed successfully may decrease the actual benefits of the Business\nCombination and that Alkuri Stockholders may not fully realize these benefits to the extent that they expected to retain the public\nshares following the completion of the Business Combination. For additional description of these risks, please see \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\u2022\nPost-Business Combination Corporate Governance. The Alkuri board of directors considered the corporate governance provisions of\nthe Merger Agreement and Babylon Holdings\u2019 anticipated organizational documents and the effect of those provisions on the\ngovernance of Babylon Holdings following the Closing. In particular, they considered that, assuming no redemptions by Alkuri\nStockholders, the Founder will individually control shares representing approximately 81.7% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 voting power (taking\naccount of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) upon completion of the Business Combination, will have significant influence over matters\nrequiring shareholder approval, and have the right to designate a majority of directors to the board of directors of Babylon, as well as\nremove directors, for as long as he holds certain amounts of Babylon Shares and will have a right to approve or reject transactions\ninvolving Babylon, including mergers or other sales of Babylon or its assets. Our Founder may in certain circumstances have sufficient\nvoting control over Babylon to amend Babylon\u2019s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights attached to\nBabylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder terminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control\nof Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights described in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon.\nThe Alkuri board of directors also considered the circumstances under which the \u201chigh vote\u201d stock would convert into \u201clow vote\u201d\nstock. The Alkuri board of directors was aware that these rights are not generally available to stockholders of Alkuri, including\nstockholders that may hold a large number of shares, or directors of Alkuri. See \u201cAgreements Entered Into in Connection with the\nMerger Agreement\u201d for detailed discussions of the terms and conditions of these agreements.\n\u2022\nNo Survival of Remedies for Breach of Representations, Warranties or Covenants by Babylon Holdings. The Alkuri board of\ndirectors considered that the terms of the Merger Agreement provide\n8\nTable of Contents\nthat neither Alkuri nor its stockholders will have any recourse against Babylon Holdings or its current shareholders after the Closing of\nthe Business Combination to recover for losses as a result of any inaccuracies or breaches of the Babylon Holdings representations,\nwarranties or covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nLitigation. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility of litigation challenging the Business Combination or that an\nadverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.\n\u2022\nFees and Expenses. The Alkuri board of directors considered the fees and expenses associated with completing the Business\nCombination, which it estimated as approximately $68.5 million.\n\u2022\nDiversion of Management. The Alkuri board of directors considered the potential for diversion of management and employee attention\nduring the period prior to the completion of the Business Combination, and the potential negative effects on Babylon Holdings\u2019\nbusiness.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s Management and Directors May Have Different Interests in the Business Combination Than the Public Stockholders. The\nAlkuri board of directors also considered the fact that members of Alkuri\u2019s management and board of directors may have interests that\nare different from, or are in addition to, the interests of its stockholders generally, including the matters described under \u201cSpecial\nMeeting of Alkuri Stockholders\u2014Interests of Alkuri\u2019s Officers and Directors in the Transactions\u201d below. However, Alkuri\u2019s board of\ndirectors concluded that the potentially disparate interests would be mitigated because (i) these interests were disclosed in the Alkuri\nIPO prospectus, and (ii) these disparate interests would exist or may be even greater with respect to a business combination with\nanother target company.\n\u2022\nRisks Related to the Dual-Class Share Structure. The Alkuri board of directors also considered the risk of concentrating voting\ncontrol in the dual-class share structure (with \u201csuper-voting\u201d rights for the Founder), but determined that they were outweighed by the\nlong-term benefits that a founder-controlled company would provide to Alkuri Stockholders and future shareholders of Babylon after\nClosing.\n\u2022\nOther Risks. Various other risks associated with Babylon Holdings\u2019 business, as described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nappearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nAlkuri\u2019s board of directors concluded that the potential benefits that it expected Alkuri and its stockholders to achieve as a result of the\nBusiness Combination outweighed the potentially negative factors associated with the Business Combination. Accordingly, Alkuri\u2019s board of\ndirectors unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination contemplated therein were advisable, fair to and in the\nbest interests of Alkuri and its stockholders.\nInterests of Alkuri\u2019s Officers and Directors in the Transactions\nIn considering the recommendation of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors to vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri\nStockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in such proposal that are different\nfrom, or in addition to, those of Alkuri Stockholders generally. In particular:\n\u2022\nIf the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such later date\nas may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of\nthe outstanding Alkuri public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of directors,\ndissolving and liquidating. In such event, the Sponsor Shares held by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and officers, which were\nacquired for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the\n9\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to participate in any redemption or distribution with respect to\nsuch shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on\nSeptember 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock\nwill be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private placement warrant. This purchase took\nplace on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from\nthese purchases were placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based\nupon the closing price of $1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private\nplacement warrants had an aggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on\nSeptember 7, 2021. The private placement warrants and Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will\nbecome worthless if Alkuri does not consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved\nby Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each\noutstanding whole warrant will become a Babylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation\nof the Business Combination and each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares\npursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s initial stockholders and owners of private placement warrants paid significantly less for their shares and warrants than other\ncurrent stockholders and holders of warrants paid for their shares and warrants purchased in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market\nthereafter. Prior to the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of\n$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s IPO and the full exercise of the\nunderwriters\u2019 over-allotment option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of\nwhich entitles the holder to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of\n$1.50 per warrant. Each outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a target value at the time of the\nBusiness Combination of $10.00. If the Business Combination is consummated, based on the difference in the purchase price of $0.003\nper share that the Sponsor paid for the Sponsor Shares, as compared to the purchase price of $10.00 per Unit sold in the IPO, these\ninitial stockholders and holders of private placement warrants will be able, at a lower price per share of Babylon Class A Common Stock,\nto recognize a greater return on their investment than stockholders or holders of warrants that purchased Alkuri Common Stock or\nAlkuri warrants in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market thereafter. Furthermore, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return even if\nthe share price of the Babylon Shares after the Closing falls below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Alkuri\nStockholders may experience a negative rate of return following the Closing of the Business Combination.\n\u2022\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, of the 7,187,500 Sponsor Shares that will be converted into 7,187,500 Babylon Class A\nshares at Closing, 1,293,750 shares (which we refer to herein as the Sponsor Earnout Shares) will be subject to restrictions if and until\nmilestones based on the achievement of certain price targets of Babylon Class A following the Closing are met. In the event such\nmilestones are not met, all of the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Babylon, which\nBabylon can redeem for an aggregate consideration of $1.00.\n\u2022\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under\ncertain circumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target\nbusinesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money\n10\nTable of Contents\nby Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri consummates a business combination, on the\nother hand, Alkuri will be liable for all such claims.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by\nthem in connection with certain activities on Alkuri\u2019s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and\nbusiness combinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have\nany claim against the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business\nCombination or another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri\nStockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their\naffiliates had incurred approximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.\n\u2022\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the aggregate dollar amount of non-reimbursable\nfunds is $ 98,230,402, comprised of (a) $85,646,250 representing the market value of Sponsor Shares, (b) $8,484,666 representing the\nmarket value of private placement warrants and (c) $4,099,486 of unpaid expenses incurred by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and\ndirectors and their affiliates. Certain Alkuri directors and executive officers have indirect economic interests in the private placement\nwarrants and in the Sponsor Shares. This includes indirect economic interests in 25,000 Sponsor Shares held by each of Katie May and\nStephen Smith and indirect economic interests in 30,000 Sponsor Shares held by Jason Harinstein. Jason Harinstein, Katie May and\nStephen Smith are independent directors of Alkuri. Envst Opportunities LLC and Works Capital LLC may be deemed to have shared\nbeneficial ownership of the Sponsor Shares and private placement warrants held directly by the Sponsor. The managing member of\nEnvst Opportunities LLC is Sultan Almaadeed, Alkuri\u2019s chairman. The manager of Works Capital LLC is Rich Williams, Alkuri\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have\nagreed to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and\nconditions as the other PIPE Investors.\n\u2022\nUntil the first anniversary of Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nwill have the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers and the continuation of\ndirectors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of\nthe date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the\nextent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.\nInterests of Babylon Holdings\u2019 Directors and Officers in the Business Combination\nIn considering the recommendation of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors in favor of the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, stockholders\nshould keep in mind that Babylon Holdings\u2019 directors and officers may have interests in such proposal that are different from, or in addition to,\nthose of Alkuri Stockholders and warrant holders generally. These interests include, among other things, the interests listed below:\n\u2022\nEntities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings\u2019 Chief Executive Officer and chairman of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of\ndirectors, and his wife, Mairi Johnson, Babylon Holdings\u2019 Chief\n1\n1\nTable of Contents\nPartnerships Officer and member of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, have agreed to purchase 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares\npursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth,\nmember of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 share\ncapital, and (ii) Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon\u2019s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019\nshare capital, have each agreed to purchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the\nsame terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.\n\u2022\nCertain of Babylon Holdings\u2019 directors and executive officers will serve as officers of Babylon following the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination. As such, in the future they will receive any cash or equity-based compensation that the Babylon board\ndetermines to pay to such officers. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cManagement Following the Business\nCombination.\u201d\n\u2022\nDr. Ali Parsadoust will control shares representing approximately 81.7% of Babylon\u2019s voting power (taking account of the Stockholder\nEarnout Shares) upon completion of the Business Combination. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Earnout\u201d.\nAgreements Entered Into in Connection with the Merger Agreement\nSubscription Agreements\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings entered into Subscription Agreements, each dated as\nof June 3, 2021, with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, Babylon Holdings agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to\nclose immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares for $10.00 per share. The PIPE Investment will be\nconsummated immediately prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions\ncontemplated by the Subscription Agreements, including the consummation of the Business Combination.\nEntities affiliated with the Sponsor have agreed to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on\nsubstantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. The Founder has agreed to purchase 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares\npursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth, member of\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 share capital, and (ii) Georgi\nGanev, member of Babylon\u2019s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 share capital, have each agreed to\npurchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE\nInvestors.\nVoting and Support Agreements\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain shareholders of Babylon Holdings, constituting the requisite number of\nshareholders of Babylon Holdings for the purposes of applicable laws and Babylon Holdings\u2019 governing documents, approved the Business\nCombination and related transactions. Babylon Holdings also entered into Voting and Support Agreements (the \u201cVoting and Support Agreements\u201d)\nwith certain shareholders of Babylon Holdings, pursuant to which such shareholders agreed, among other things, not to revoke their approval of the\nBusiness Combination and the Transactions.\nRegistration Rights Agreement\nIn connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Alkuri, the Sponsor, Babylon Holdings, certain Alkuri Stockholders and certain\nshareholders of Babylon entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) containing customary registration\nrights for the stockholders party to the agreement.\n12\nTable of Contents\nLockup Agreement\nConcurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Babylon Holdings, the Sponsor and certain shareholders of Babylon have entered\ninto a lockup agreement (collectively, the \u201cLockup Agreement\u201d).

If a\nholder of Alkuri public shares properly demands such redemption, delivers his, her or its shares to Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent as described above, and\nthe Business Combination is consummated, Alkuri will redeem each Alkuri public share into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, calculated as\nof two (2) business days prior to the date of the special meeting.

Babylon is evaluating obtaining debt\nfinancing with a principal ranging between $100 million and $200 million to be entered into concurrently with or shortly after the Closing on\ncustomary terms, which may include security interests, restrictive covenants and/or warrants for the purchase of shares of Babylon.

There are also differences between the laws governing Alkuri,\na Delaware corporation, and Babylon, a Jersey company. For more information, please see \u201cComparison of Rights of Babylon Shareholders and\nAlkuri Stockholders\u201d in this proxy statement/prospectus for more information.\nImplications of being an \u201cEmerging Growth Company\u201d and a \u201cForeign Private Issuer\u201d\nEach of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings is, and consequently, following the Business Combination, Babylon will be, an \u201cemerging growth\ncompany,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As\nsuch, Babylon will be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in their periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find Babylon\u2019s\nsecurities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Babylon\u2019s securities and the prices of Babylon\u2019s securities may be\nmore volatile.\nBabylon will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the\nclosing of the Alkuri IPO, (b) in which Babylon has total annual gross\n15\nTable of Contents\nrevenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which Babylon is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of Babylon\u2019s common\nequity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter\u037e and (ii) the\ndate on which Babylon has issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to\n\u201cemerging growth company\u201d have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\nBabylon Holdings is also considered a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d and will report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the\n\u201cExchange Act\u201d) as a non-U.S. company with \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d status. This means that, even after Babylon Holdings no longer qualifies as an\n\u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as long as it qualifies as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the Exchange Act, it will be exempt from certain provisions of\nand intends to take advantage certain exemptions from the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including:\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered\nunder the Exchange Act\u037e\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for\ninsiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time\u037e and\nBabylon Holdings may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until such time as it is no longer a \u201cforeign private issuer.\u201d Babylon\nHoldings could lose its status as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Babylon Holdings\u2019\noutstanding voting securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of the\nBabylon Holding\u2019s directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents\u037e (ii) more than 50% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 assets are located in the\nUnited States\u037e or (iii) Babylon Holdings\u2019 business is administered principally in the United States.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. Babylon Holdings has taken advantage of\nreduced reporting requirements in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Over time, Babylon Holdings expects the proportion of risk-based\nrevenue may increase. Babylon Holdings will not have control over these costs, particularly in cases where members use third party\nservices instead of Babylon Holdings\u2019 services\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings may face intense competition, which could limit Babylon Holdings\u2019 ability to maintain or expand market share within\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 industry, and if Babylon Holdings does not maintain or expand Babylon Holdings\u2019 market share, Babylon Holdings\u2019\nbusiness and operating results will be harmed\u037e\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings is not able to develop and release new solutions and services, or successful enhancements, new features and\nmodifications to our existing solutions and services, Babylon Holdings\u2019 business could be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nThere are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenue that Babylon Holdings recognizes under Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 licensing agreements, and risk-based agreements with health plans, and if Babylon Holdings\u2019 estimates of revenue are\nmaterially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of Babylon Holdings\u2019 revenue recognition or have a material adverse\neffect on Babylon Holdings\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\u037e\n\u2022\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to Babylon Holdings\u2019 business or\nmembers, or prevent Babylon Holdings from accessing critical information and expose Babylon Holdings to liability, which could\nadversely affect Babylon Holdings\u2019 business and reputation\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 use, disclosure, and other processing of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject\nto the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic\nand Clinical Health Act, (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and their implementing regulations, GDPR, the DPA 2018 and other privacy, and security\nregulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information Babylon holds could result in\nsignificant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on Babylon\u2019s customer base, member base and revenue\u037e\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings is unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for Babylon Holdings\u2019 technology or if\nthe scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently\n17\nTable of Contents\nbroad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar to that of Babylon Holdings, and Babylon\u2019s\nability to successfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause Babylon Holdings to incur significant expenses\nand may require Babylon Holdings to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings has been, and may in the future become, subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, which could harm Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 business\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings relies on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software and other third\nparties for providing services to Babylon Holdings\u2019 customers and members, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by\nthese third parties could expose Babylon Holdings to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with customers and members,\nadversely affecting Babylon\u2019s operating results\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings conducts business in a heavily regulated industry and if Babylon Holdings fails to comply with these laws and\ngovernment regulations, or if the rules and regulations change or the approach that regulators take in classifying Babylon Holdings\u2019\nproducts and services under such regulations change, Babylon Holdings could incur penalties or be required to make significant\nchanges to Babylon Holdings\u2019 operations, products, or services or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse\neffect on Babylon Holdings\u2019 business, financial condition, and results of operations\u037e\n\u2022\nThe impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on Babylon\nHoldings is currently unknown, but may adversely affect Babylon Holdings\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings depends on its talent to grow and operate our business, and if Babylon Holdings is unable to hire, integrate,\ndevelop, motivate and retain personnel, Babylon Holdings may not be able to grow effectively\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe other matters described in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this proxy statement/prospectus.\n18\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nDefined terms included below shall have the same meaning as terms defined and included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nIntroduction\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presents the pro forma effects of the following transactions:\n\u2022\nthe Business Combination\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Higi acquisition. As described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Babylon Holdings has an option to acquire Higi. See\n\u201c\u2014Description of the Business Combination.\u201d\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of financial position as of June 30, 2021 (\u201cPro Forma Statement of Financial\nPosition\u201d) give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they were consummated on June 30, 2021. The unaudited\npro forma condensed combined statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive loss (\u201cPro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss\u201d) for the year\nended December 31, 2020 and six months ended June 30, 2021 give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they\nhad occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma statements of financial position do not purport to represent, and are not necessarily indicative of,\nwhat the actual financial condition of Babylon would have been had the Business Combination and Higi acquisition taken place on June 30, 2021, as\napplicable, nor are they indicative of the financial condition of Babylon as of any future date. The pro forma statements of profit and loss do not\npurport to represent, and are not necessarily indicative of, what the actual results of operations of Babylon would have been had the Business\nCombination and Higi acquisition taken place on January 1, 2020, as applicable, nor are they indicative of the results of operations of Babylon for\nany future period. The unaudited pro forma adjustments represent management\u2019s estimates based on information available as of the date of these\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses\nare performed.\nThis information should be read together with the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of each of Alkuri, Babylon Holdings\nand Higi, including the notes thereto, as well as the disclosures contained in the sections titled \u201cBabylon\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cAlkuri\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations\u201d and other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the following\nhistorical financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus:\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\nHigi\u2019s historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nHigi\u2019s historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020\u037e\n19Table of Contents\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021\u037e and\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. As a newly\nincorporated business on December 1, 2020, the results of Alkuri prior to January 1, 2021 were not material.\nThe historical consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in its presentation currency\nof USD. The historical financial statements of Alkuri and Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of\nUSD. In the case of Alkuri and Higi, adjustments were made to conform the U.S. GAAP financial statements to IFRS. Accordingly, pro forma\nadjustments have been reflected to conform the basis of accounting and accounting policies for Alkuri and Higi to those of Babylon Holdings. The\nhistorical consolidated financial statements of Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of USD and have\nbeen adjusted to give effect to material differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information.\nDescription of the Business Combination\nBabylon Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement, dated June 3, 2021, by and among Babylon Holdings, Merger Sub, Alkuri and the\nSponsor, which, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving company and\nwholly owned subsidiary of Babylon (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). For more information about the Business Combination, please see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nOn May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a\nnetwork of Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on\na fully diluted basis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all\nproposed investments, it will hold over 25% of Higi\u2019s shareholdings on a fully diluted basis.\nOn June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a letter agreement (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d) with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three\nlargest shareholders in Higi. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon\u2019s option to purchase the\nremaining shares of Higi will be exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon\nwould provide registration rights to such shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare\nand Wrigley agreed to be paid in shares of Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.\nThe contemplated consideration for the Higi acquisition is $70.3 million. Accordingly, the parties expect to issue up to 6.4 million shares of\nBabylon Holdings as the consideration in the transaction, with each share of Babylon Holdings to be valued at $10 per share although shareholders\nother than 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley may elect to accept cash in lieu of shares. Because of the agreement reached in the Letter Agreement, Babylon\nHoldings will issue at least 3.9 million shares of Babylon Holdings as the consideration in the transaction. In connection with the Higi acquisition,\ncertain continuing employees, as determined by Babylon, will receive restricted stock units granted in respect of Babylon Class A Shares (\u201cBabylon\nRSUs\u201d), valued at $10. Babylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon\nHoldings. As such, the historical financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma\nStatement of Financial Position assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss\nassumes that the Higi acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAccounting for the Business Combination\nThe Business Combination with Alkuri will be accounted for as a merger in accordance with IFRS. Under this method of accounting, Alkuri will\nbe treated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company for financial reporting purposes. Babylon Holdings has accounted for its acquisition of Alkuri as a Business\nCombination because Babylon is considered the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on the assumptions that Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 shareholders will hold a majority of the voting power of Babylon, Babylon Holdings\u2019 operations will substantially comprise the ongoing\noperations of Babylon, Babylon Holdings\u2019 designees are expected to comprise a majority of the governing body of Babylon, and Babylon Holdings\u2019\nsenior management will comprise the senior management of Babylon. Because Alkuri does not meet the definition of a business in accordance with\nIFRS 3, Business Combinations (\u201cIFRS 3\u201d) (\u201cIFRS 3\u201d), and the net assets of Alkuri primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Business\nCombination is accounted for as a Business Combination whereby the net assets of Alkuri will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other\nintangible assets recorded. However, any excess of the share consideration issued by Babylon over the fair value of Alkuri\u2019s identifiable net assets\nacquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 2,\nShare-based payment (\u201cIFRS 2\u201d). Accordingly, the excess of the fair value of the share consideration in excess of the net book value of the assets of\nAlkuri has been reflected as a recapitalization transaction expense in the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss. Operations prior to the Business\nCombination will be deemed to be those of Babylon Holdings.\nBasis of Pro Forma Presentation\nThe adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to\nprovide an understanding of Babylon upon consummation of the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation\nS-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 \u201cAmendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.\u201d Release\nNo. 33-10786 replaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction\n(\u201cTransaction Accounting Adjustments\u201d) and present the reasonably estimable synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are\nreasonably expected to occur (\u201cManagement\u2019s Adjustments\u201d). Babylon Holdings has elected not to present Management\u2019s Adjustments and will\nonly be presenting Transaction Accounting Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been\ndifferent had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as\nbeing indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that Babylon\nwill achieve. Babylon and Alkuri have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments\nwere required to eliminate activities between the companies.\nThe following summarizes the consideration:\n(in thousands, except for share amounts)\nShares transferred at Closing\n336,427,107\nValue per share(1)\n$\n10.00\nTotal Share Consideration\n$\n3,364,271\n(1)\nShare Consideration is calculated using a $10.00 reference price. Actual total Share\nConsideration will be dependent on the value of Alkuri Common Stock at Closing.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming two alternative levels of redemption into\ncash of Alkuri Common Stock:\n\u2022\nScenario 1 \u2013 Assuming no redemptions for cash: This presentation assumes that no Alkuri Stockholders exercise redemption rights\nwith respect to their shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon consummation of the Business Combination\u037e and\n\u2022\nScenario 2 \u2013 Assuming redemptions of 34,500,000 of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash: This presentation assumes that Alkuri\nStockholders exercise their redemption rights with respect to a maximum of 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon\nconsummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of approximately $10.00 per share. The maximum redemption amount\nreflects the redemption of all outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock given the minimum requirements in the Merger Agreement of\n$230 million of cash held either in or outside of the trust account, including the aggregate amount of any proceeds from the PIPE\nInvestment, after giving effect to the payments to redeeming Alkuri Stockholders. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in\nScenario 1 and presents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of maximum redemptions.\nAfter the Closing, assuming no redemptions of shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash, Alkuri Stockholders and the Sponsor will\nown 9.8% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Shares and 1,300,000 shares from the PIPE Investment), the PIPE Investors will\nown approximately 5.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including shares purchased by the Founder, Sponsor and certain existing Babylon\nHoldings shareholders in the PIPE Investment) and the existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will own approximately 85.0% of the outstanding\nBabylon Shares. Additionally, the capitalization table includes Earnout Class A Shares issued to the Sponsor of 0.3% and Earnout Class B Shares\nissued to the Founder of 8.8%. Assuming redemption by holders of all 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock, the Sponsor will own\napproximately 1.8% of the outstanding Babylon Shares, the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.7% of outstanding Babylon Shares and the\nexisting shareholders of Babylon Holdings will own approximately 92.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (in each case, not giving effect to any\nshares purchased by the Founder, the Sponsor and existing Babylon Holdings shareholders in the PIPE Investment and any shares issuable upon\nthe exercise or conversion of warrants or options outstanding). The Sponsor will own an additional 0.3% of the outstanding Babylon shares and the\nFounder will own an additional 9.5% of the outstanding Babylon shares as a result of the Earnout Class A and B Shares issued and outstanding.\nThe foregoing does not reflect the effect of the exercise of the 5,933,333 private placement warrants held by the Sponsor or the 8,625,000 public\nwarrants. Assuming all of the private placement warrants and public warrants are exercised and the earnout milestones are met such that the Earnout\nShares are not subject to the repurchase right, (i) there would be a total of 441,352,107 shares of Babylon Holdings outstanding (assuming no\nredemptions) and (ii) there would be a total of 406,852,107 shares of Babylon Holdings (assuming maximum redemptions).\nAssuming No Redemptions\nAssuming Maximum Redemptions\nShares\n% of Total\nOutstanding\n% of\nTotal\nVoting\nPower\nShares\n% of Total\nOutstanding\n% of\nTotal\nVoting\nPower\nBabylon shareholders \u2013 Class A\n295,589,531\n66.9%\n18.9%\n295,589,531\n72.7%\n19.4%\nBabylon shareholders \u2013 Class B\n40,837,576\n9.3%\n39.4%\n40,837,576\n10.0%\n40.3%\nEarnout shares \u2013 Class A\n1,293,750\n0.3%\n0.1%\n1,293,750\n0.3%\n0.1%\nEarnout shares \u2013 Class B\n38,800,000\n8.8%\n37.4%\n38,800,000\n9.5%\n38.2%\nAlkuri Public Shares\n34,500,000\n7.8%\n2.2%\n\u2014\n0.0%\n0.0%\nSponsor Shares(1)\n7,331,250\n1.7%\n0.5%\n7,331,250\n1.8%\n0.5%\nPIPE(2)\n23,000,000\n5.2%\n1.5%\n23,000,000\n5.7%\n1.5%\nTotal\n441,352,107\n100.0%\n100.0%\n406,852,107\n100.0%\n100.0%\n22\nTable of Contents\n(1)\nDoes not include 1,300,000 shares being subscribed for by the Sponsor and its affiliates as described in the following footnote.

no Alkuri Stockholders exercise redemption rights\nwith respect to their shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon the Closing of the Business Combination\u037e and (2) assuming that

consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2021\nprepared in accordance with IFRS. Higi\u2019s statement of financial position was extracted from the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,\n2021. The Higi statement of financial position was prepared in accordance of U.S. GAAP. The Alkuri statement of financial position was extracted\nfrom the unaudited condensed balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n(A)\nTo reflect the proceeds received from the PIPE Investment with the corresponding issuance of 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares at\napproximately US$10.00 per share, or $230 million.\n(B)\nTo reflect the release of cash from marketable securities held in the trust account.\n(C)\nTo reflect the elimination of historical accumulated deficit in Alkuri as it is the accounting acquiree.\n(D)\nTo reflect the settlement of Alkuri\u2019s historical current liabilities at Closing.\n(E)\nTo reflect the reclassification of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption of approximately $303 million from\ntemporary equity under U.S. GAAP to a liability under IFRS, because the right to redeem is at the option of the holder. The additional\nadjustment is related to the reclassification of approximately $303 million of Alkuri Class A Common Stock subject to possible\nredemption to permanent equity.\n(F)\nThe fair value of share consideration of $414 million and Alkuri\u2019s net assets of $308 million result in an excess of the fair value of the\nshares issued over the value of the net monetary assets acquired of $105 million. Assuming no redemptions, this was reflected as a\ntransaction expense of $106 million for the services provided by Alkuri in connection with the listing. The fair value calculation of $414\nmillion is based on the combined company estimated fair value derived from Babylon\u2019s enterprise valuation of $3.6 billion and the level\nof ownership that existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will have in Babylon of approximately 85%, after taking into account the\nStockholder Earnout and Sponsor Earnout.

December 15, 2021. In\naccordance with IFRS 16, Leases\u00b8 and Babylon\u2019s accounting policies, right of use assets of $1.2 million and lease liabilities of $1.8 million have\nbeen recognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2021. In addition, accrued rent liabilities of $0.3 million have been derecognized from the\nbalance sheet as of June 30, 2021. The impact of the adjustments to the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.\n3.)\nUnder U.S. GAAP, Higi elected to apply the straight-line approach for graded vesting when measuring share- based payment awards. Under\nIFRS, Babylon would use the graded vesting method, resulting in a higher proportion of cost being allocated to the earlier years. The impact of\nthe adjustments to the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.\nNote 2. Preliminary Allocation of Purchase Price\nOn May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a\nnetwork of Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series\n35\nTable of Contents\nof investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on a fully diluted basis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option\nto continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all proposed investments, it will hold over 25% of Higi\u2019s shareholdings on a fully\ndiluted basis.\nOn June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Letter Agreement with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest shareholders in\nHigi. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon\u2019s option to purchase the remaining shares of Higi\nwill be exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon would provide registration\nrights to such shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley agreed to be paid\nin shares of Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.\nBabylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon Holdings. As such,\nthe historical financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma Statement of Financial\nPosition assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss assumes that the Higi\nacquisition occurred on January 1, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, the total shareholding was 19.0% and 25%, respectively.\nThe transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS and\nassuming Babylon Holdings closed the Higi acquisition by purchasing the remaining 75% for estimated consideration with a fair value of\napproximately $70.3 million. The Higi Acquisition was achieved in stages, which required Babylon Holdings to remeasure its previously held equity\ninterest in Higi at its acquisition date fair value. As no material control premium was determined to exist, estimated consideration transferred to\nacquire the remaining stake in Higi was used to estimate the fair value of Babylon Holdings\u2019 previously held equity interest. This remeasurement\nresulted in gains of approximately $14.6 million and $ 10.8 million, which recorded in Other (income) expense within Babylon Holdings\u2019 pro forma\nconsolidated statement of profit and loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred and the preliminary estimated fair values of the major classes of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired has been determined using prior\nacquisitions as a benchmark for the purposes of a preliminary purchase price allocation.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation (in 000s)\nCash consideration\n$\n5,202\nShares issued as consideration\n53,553\nFair value of existing equity interest\n23,440\nAdditional consideration\n11,565\nTotal consideration transferred\n93,760\nTrade and other receivables\n2,837\nPrepayments and contract assets\n294\nOther intangible assets\n31,837\nTrade and other payables and Accruals and provisions\n(2,303)\nOther assets and liabilities, net\n4,685\nNet Assets Acquired\n37,350\nAmount Allocated to Goodwill\n$56,410\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe goodwill allocation of $56.4 million reflects expectations of favorable future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies through the scale\nof our combined operations, and the assembled workforce.\nPro Forma Adjustments\nThe following pro forma adjustments were added to give effect to the Higi acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.\n(AA)\nReflects the elimination of the previous investment related to Higi of $12.6 million and the step up to the fair value of prior existing equity\ninterest of $23.4 million. This step-up in fair value resulted in a gain of $10.8 million.\n(BB)\nTo reflect the elimination of Higi\u2019s historical equity.\n(CC)\nTo reflect the consideration payment in the form of $5.2 million in cash, shares issued as consideration with an estimated fair value of $53.6\nmillion fair value of existing equity interest of $23.4 million and $11.6 million in deferred consideration, resulting in an addition of goodwill of\n$56.4 million and $53.6 million in additional paid capital.\n(DD)\nTo reflect the elimination of historical intangible assets of $0.2 million along with the fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $31.9\nmillion along with its respective impact on Deferred Tax Liabilities of $6.1 million. This results in a reduction of the addition to goodwill by\n$25.8 million. Our preliminary estimate of the weighted average useful lives of the acquired intangible assets was determined to be 7.0 years\nbased on the useful lives assigned to comparable historical acquisitions. The amortization of the intangible assets over a 7.0 year period\nresulted in an expense of $4.5 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021,\nrespectively.\n(EE)\nThis adjustment is to reflect the payment of Higi\u2019s debt using its cash on hand. If the cash on hand is not sufficient, part of the consideration\ntransferred will be used to settle the Related party convertible notes at Closing. This results in a reduction in the cash balance of $5.5 million,\nelimination of $7.0 million of debt and a reduction of goodwill by $1.5 million.\n37\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "RISK FACTORS\nIf the Business Combination is completed, Babylon will operate in a market environment that is difficult to predict and that involves significant\nrisks, many of which will be beyond its control. You should carefully consider the risks described below before voting your shares. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to Babylon Holdings and Alkuri or that they do not currently believe are important to an investor, if they\nmaterialize, also may adversely affect the Business Combination. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the\nfollowing risks actually occur, Babylon Holdings\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the\ntrading price of Babylon Class A Shares or, if the Business Combination is not consummated, Alkuri Common Stock could decline, and you may lose\npart or all of the value of any Babylon Class A Shares or, if the Business Combination is not consummated, shares of Alkuri Common Stock that you\nhold.\nYou should also consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, including the Merger Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy\nstatement/prospectus is a part.\nInvesting in Babylon Class A Shares involves risks, some of which are related to the Business Combination. In considering the Business\nCombination, you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, as well as the other information included in or incorporated\nby reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including Babylon Holdings\u2019 consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cBabylon\u2019s\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below are those\nsignificant risk factors, currently known and specific to us, that we believe are relevant to an investment in Babylon Class A Shares. Additional risks\nand uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm us and adversely affect the Babylon Class A Shares.\nYou are also encouraged to read and consider the risk factors specific to Alkuri\u2019s businesses (that may also affect Babylon) described in Alkuri\u2019s\nannual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 because, as a result of the Business Combination, they will become our risks.\nPlease see \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information,\u201d for information on where you can find the periodic reports and other documents we and\nAlkuri have filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nIn this section \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Babylon Holdings prior to the Closing and Babylon following the Closing.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe below summary risks provide an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. The below\nsummary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks below together with the more\ndetailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe summary risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones Babylon Holdings faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently\nknown to Babylon Holdings or that it currently deems less significant may also affect Babylon Holdings\u2019 business operations or financial results.\nConsistent with the foregoing, Babylon Holdings is exposed to a variety of risks, including those associated with the following:\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings has a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and it may not be able to achieve or maintain\nprofitability.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects and increases\nthe risk of your investment.\n38Table of Contents\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings fails to effectively manage its growth, Babylon Holdings may be unable to execute its business plan, adequately\naddress competitive challenges or maintain its corporate culture, and its business, financial condition and results of operations would be\nharmed.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 business and growth strategy depend on its ability to maintain and expand a network of qualified providers. If Babylon\nHoldings is unable to do so, its future growth would be limited and its business, financial condition and results of operations would be\nharmed.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings is dependent on its relationships with physician-owned entities to hold contracts and provide healthcare services.\nBabylon Holdings does not own such professional entities, and its business could be harmed if relationships with either those entities or\ntheir owners were disrupted.\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings is unable to attract new customers and expand member enrollment with existing customers, its revenue growth could be\nslower than it expects, and its business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings\u2019 existing customers do not continue to use its services or renew their contracts with Babylon Holdings, renew at lower\nfee levels or decline to purchase additional applications and services from Babylon Holdings, it could have a material adverse effect on\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 revenue sources are highly concentrated, and the loss of any key contracts could have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nUnder many of Babylon Holdings\u2019 agreements with health plans, Babylon Holdings assumes some or all of the risk that the cost of\nproviding services will exceed its compensation. Over time, Babylon Holdings expects the proportion of risk-based revenue may increase.\nBabylon Holdings will not have control over these costs, particularly in cases where members use third party services instead of Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 services.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings may face intense competition, which could limit its ability to maintain or expand market share within its industry, and if\nBabylon Holdings does not maintain or expand its market share its business and operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings is not able to develop and release new solutions and services, or successful enhancements, new features and\nmodifications to its existing solutions and services, Babylon Holdings\u2019 business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThere are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenue that Babylon Holdings recognizes under its licensing\nagreements, and risk-based agreements with health plans, and if Babylon Holdings\u2019 estimates of revenue are materially inaccurate, it could\nimpact the timing and the amount of its revenue recognition or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to Babylon Holdings\u2019 business or\nmembers, or prevent Babylon Holdings from accessing critical information and expose it to liability, which could adversely affect its\nbusiness and our reputation.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 use, disclosure, and other processing of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject to\nHIPAA, the GDPR and the DPA 2018, and other privacy, and security regulations, and Babylon Holdings\u2019 failure to comply with those\nregulations or to adequately secure the information it holds could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material\nadverse effect on its customer base, member base and revenue.\n\u2022\nIf Babylon Holdings is unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for its technology or if the scope of its\nintellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar\nto Babylon Holdings\u2019, and its ability to successfully commercialize its technology may be adversely affected.\n39\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and may require it to\npay significant damages if not covered by insurance.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings has been and may in the future become subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, which could harm its business.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings relies on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software and other third parties\nfor providing services to its customers and members, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could\nexpose Babylon Holdings to litigation and negatively impact its relationships with customers and members, adversely affecting Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 operating results.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings conducts business in a heavily regulated industry and if Babylon Holdings fails to comply with these laws and\ngovernment regulations, or if the rules and regulations change or the approach that regulators take in classifying Babylon Holdings\u2019\nproducts and services under such regulations change, it could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to its operations,\nproducts, or services or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n\u2022\nThe impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on Babylon\nHoldings is currently unknown, but may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings depends on its talent to grow and operate its business, and if it is unable to hire, integrate, develop, motivate and retain\nits personnel, Babylon Holdings may not be able to grow effectively.\nRisks Related to the Business Combination\nThe completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of important conditions, and the Merger Agreement may be terminated before\nthe completion of the Business Combination in accordance with its terms. As a result, there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be\ncompleted.\nThe completion of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of a number of important conditions set forth in\nthe Merger Agreement, including the approval of the Business Combination by the Alkuri Stockholders, the approval of the listing of the Babylon Class\nA Shares on the NYSE, and several other customary closing conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or, if applicable, waived by December 3, 2021,\nunless extended, the Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party and you will not receive the Merger Consideration. For more information, see\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus may not be representative of Babylon\u2019s results after the\nBusiness Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information of Babylon included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus has been presented for\ninformational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the\ntransactions reflected therein been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of our future operating results or financial position after the\nassumed consummation of the transactions or other individually insignificant acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma financial information of Babylon\npresent the combination of our financial information and the financial information of Babylon after giving effect to the Business Combination, the Higi\nacquisition and related adjustments described in the accompanying notes. See \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed combined Financial Information.\u201d\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information of Babylon does not reflect future events that may occur, including any future nonrecurring charges\nresulting from the Business Combination, and does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense. The unaudited\nprospective financial\n40\nTable of Contents\ninformation of Babylon is based in part on certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our assumptions may not prove\nto be accurate over time.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. As a result, Babylon\u2019s projected revenue\nand Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from expectations.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 operates in a rapidly changing and competitive industry and its projections will be subject to the risks and assumptions made\nby management with respect to its industry. Operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on a number of factors, including\nthe competition Babylon Holdings\u2019 faces, and its ability to attract and retain customers and enterprise partnerships, while generating sustained revenues.\nThis may result in decreased revenue levels, and Babylon Holdings may be unable to adopt measures in a timely manner to compensate for any\nunexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause Babylon Holdings\u2019 operating results in a given quarter to be higher or lower than expected.\nThese factors make creating accurate forecasts and budgets challenging and, as a result, Babylon Holdings may fall materially short of its forecasts and\nexpectations, which could cause its stock price to decline and investors to lose confidence in it.\nThe Business Combination may not result in increased share liquidity for Babylon\u2019s shareholders, including former Alkuri Stockholders, following\nthe Business Combination.\nWe are undertaking the Business Combination because we believe that the Business Combination will provide Babylon Holdings and Alkuri, and\ntheir and our respective shareholders, with a number of advantages, including providing our shareholders and Alkuri Stockholders with securities that we\nexpect will enjoy greater market liquidity than the securities these shareholders currently hold. However, the Business Combination may not accomplish\nthese objectives particularly given the number of shares to be held by Babylon or Alkuri affiliates and the right of Alkuri Stockholders to redeem their\nAlkuri Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether a liquid market for the\nnewly issued Babylon Class A Shares will be maintained. If the Business Combination does not result in increased liquidity for the securities held by\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 shareholders and Alkuri Stockholders, you may experience a decrease in your ability to sell the Babylon Class A Shares you receive in\nthe Business Combination compared to your ability to sell the Alkuri Common Stock you currently hold.\nDue to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition\ncompanies, the Business Combination is not expected to qualify as a tax-deferred \u201creorganization\u201d under Section 368(a) of the Code, in which case\nthe Business Combination will be a taxable transaction with respect to U.S. holders of Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants.\nDue to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition\ncompanies and the risk that similar levels of redemptions could occur in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination is not\nexpected to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction, including as a \u201creorganization\u201d under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that is the\ncase, holders of Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants will generally be treated as if they sold their Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri Warrants in a\ntaxable transaction and will be taxable on the receipt of the Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants in the Business Combination.\nNo ruling has been requested, nor is one intended to be requested, from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business\nCombination. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination is subject to both legal and factual uncertainty, is not free from doubt,\nand may change depending on the actual level of redemptions that occur in connection with the Business Combination. No opinion of counsel has or will\nbe provided regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Consequently, no assurance can be given whether the IRS will\nassert, or that a court would sustain, a position contrary to that described above.\nFor additional information, please read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.\u201d The tax consequences to you of\nthe Business Combination will depend on your particular facts\n41\nTable of Contents\nand circumstances. Please consult your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Business Combination in your particular circumstances,\nincluding the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws.\nYour ownership percentage in Babylon will be less than the ownership percentage you currently hold in Alkuri.\nYour ownership percentage in Babylon Class A Shares following the Business Combination will be less than your existing ownership percentage in\nAlkuri as a result of dilution attributable to the relative equity values of the companies involved in the Business Combination. Immediately after the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, it is anticipated that: (i) Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon Shares and\n2.2% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power of\nBabylon\u037e (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and\n0.6% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and\n95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power of Babylon being held by the Founder). These levels of ownership interest: (a)\nexclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination\u037e (b) assume\nthat no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account and (c)\nexcludes the impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment.\nWhen including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2%\nof the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the\nvoting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions. As a result, Alkuri Stockholders will have less influence over matters submitted to a vote of\nBabylon shareholders than they currently hold in Alkuri.\nAlkuri\u2019s stockholders will experience dilution as a consequence of the Business Combination.\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination, assuming that no shares of Alkuri Common Stock are elected to be redeemed\nby Alkuri stockholders and subject to the assumptions set forth below, the concentration of ownership of Babylon immediately following the\nconsummation of the Business Combination will be as follows:\nBeneficial Owners\nOwnership\nPercentage\nAssuming\nthe\nCompletion\nof the\nHigi\nAcquisition\nOwnership\nPercentage\nWithout\nthe\nCompletion\nof the\nHigi\nAcquisition\nAlkuri\u2019s existing public stockholders\n8.4%\n8.6%\nSponsor Shares\n1.8%\n1.8%\nBabylon Holdings shareholders\n82.4%\n83.9%\nPIPE Investors\n5.6%\n5.7%\nImplied Value Per Share\n$\n10.22\n$\n10.40\nEffective Deferred Underwriting Fee\n$\n0.03\n$\n0.03\n42\nTable of Contents\nAlternatively, it is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination, assuming that fifty percent (50%) of the shares of Alkuri\nCommon Stock are elected to be redeemed by Alkuri stockholders and subject to the assumptions set forth below, the concentration of ownership of\nBabylon immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination will be as follows:\nBeneficial Owners\nOwnership\nPercentage\nAssuming\nthe\nCompletion\nof the\nHigi\nAcquisition\nOwnership\nPercentage\nWithout\nthe\nCompletion\nof the Higi\nAcquisition\nAlkuri\u2019s existing public stockholders\n4.4%\n4.5%\nSponsor Shares\n1.9%\n1.9%\nBabylon Holdings shareholders\n86.0%\n87.6%\nPIPE Investors\n5.9%\n6.0%\nImplied Value Per Share\n$\n10.68\n$\n10.87\nEffective Deferred Underwriting Fee\n$\n0.03\n$\n0.03\nAlternatively, it is anticipated that, upon completion of the business combination, assuming all shares of Alkuri Common Stock are elected to be\nredeemed by Alkuri stockholders and subject to the assumptions set forth below, the concentration of ownership of Babylon immediately following the\nconsummation of the Business Combination will be as follows:\nBeneficial Owners\nOwnership\nPercentage\nAssuming\nthe\nCompletion\nof the\nHigi\nAcquisition\nOwnership\nPercentage\nWithout\nthe\nCompletion\nof the Higi\nAcquisition\nAlkuri\u2019s existing public stockholders\n0.0%\n0.0%\nSponsor Shares\n2.0%\n2.0%\nBabylon Holdings shareholders\n90.0%\n91.7%\nPIPE Investors\n6.2%\n6.3%\nImplied Value Per Share\n$\n11.17\n$\n11.38\nEffective Deferred Underwriting Fee\n$\n0.03\n$\n0.03\nThe calculation of implied value per share assumes (i) an enterprise value of approximately $3.6 billion for Babylon, (ii) $230 million of cash\nproceeds received from the PIPE transaction upon consummation of the business combination, and (iii) approximately $345 million of funds in the Alkuri\ntrust account immediately prior to any redemptions.\nThe ownership percentages of Babylon set forth in the foregoing tables (a) exclude (1) the Babylon Class A Shares issuable upon the exercise of\nwarrants that will remain outstanding following the Business Combination and (2) any Babylon Class A Shares issuable upon the conversion of equity\nawards issued to holders of outstanding equity awards in connection with the Business Combination, and (b) assume (1) the completion of the Business\nCombination occurs promptly following the Alkuri Stockholder meeting to which this proxy statement relates, (2) that approximately 401,258,357 Babylon\nClass A Shares (in the no redemption scenario), 384,008,357 Babylon Class A Shares (in the fifty percent (50%) redemption scenario), and 366,758,357\nBabylon Class A Shares (in the maximum redemption scenario) are outstanding immediately after consummation of the Business Combination. For more\ninformation, please see the section entitled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.\u201d Additionally, in the columns marked\n\u201cOwnership Percentage Assuming the Completion of the Higi Acquisition,\u201d the ownership percentages of Babylon assume the completion of the Higi\nacquisition and the issuance of an additional 6.4 million shares of Babylon Holdings as consideration in the transaction (although certain shareholders\nmay elect to accept cash in lieu of shares). Please see the section entitled \u201cBeneficial Ownership of Securities\u201d for more information regarding beneficial\nownership of Babylon Class A Shares and projected beneficial ownership of Babylon Class A Shares following the consummation of the Business\nCombination.\n43\nTable of Contents\nDirectors of Alkuri have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that stockholders vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination and\napproval of the other proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nWhen considering the Alkuri board of directors\u2019 recommendation that Alkuri Stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Business\nCombination, Alkuri Stockholders should be aware that Alkuri\u2019s directors and executive officers, advisors and entities affiliated with them, have interests\nin the Business Combination that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Alkuri Stockholders. These interests include:\n\u2022\nIf the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as\nmay be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming 100% of the\noutstanding public shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of directors, dissolving and\nliquidating. In such event, the Sponsor Shares held by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and officers, which were acquired for an\naggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to participate in any\nredemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based upon the closing\nprice of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each\noutstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private warrant. This purchase took place on a\nprivate placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these purchases\nwere placed in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based upon the closing price\nof $1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants had an\naggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private\nwarrants and the Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will become worthless if Alkuri does not\nconsummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment\nto the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding whole warrant will become a\nBabylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon ordinary share following consummation of the Business Combination and each\noutstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s initial stockholders and owners of private placement warrants paid significantly less for their shares and warrants than other current\nstockholders and holders of warrants paid for their shares and warrants purchased in the Alkuri IPO or in the open market thereafter. Prior to\nthe consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or\napproximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s IPO and the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 over-\nallotment option, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of which entitles the holder\nto purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per warrant. Each\noutstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a target value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00. If\nthe Business Combination is consummated, based on the difference in the purchase price of $0.003 per share that the Sponsor paid for the\nSponsor Shares, as compared to the purchase price of $10.00 per Unit sold in the IPO, these initial stockholders and holders of private\nplacement warrants will be able, at a lower price per share of Babylon Class A Common Stock, to recognize a greater return on their\ninvestment than stockholders or holders of warrants that purchased Alkuri Common Stock or Alkuri warrants in the Alkuri IPO or in the\nopen market thereafter. Furthermore, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return even if the share price of the Babylon Shares after the\nClosing falls below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Alkuri Stockholders may experience a negative rate of return\nfollowing the Closing of the Business Combination.\n44\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, of the 7,187,500 Sponsor Shares that will be converted into 7.187,500 Babylon Class A shares at\nClosing, 1,293,750 shares (which we refer to herein as the Sponsor Earnout Shares) will be subject to restrictions if and until milestones\nbased on the achievement of certain price targets of Babylon Class A following the Closing are met. In the event such milestones are not\nmet, all of the Sponsor Earnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Babylon which Babylon can redeem for an\naggregate consideration of $1.00.\n\u2022\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under certain\ncircumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims\nof vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri\nconsummates a business combination, on the other hand, Alkuri will be liable for all such claims.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them\nin connection with certain activities on Alkuri\u2019s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business\ncombinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have any claim\nagainst the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business Combination\nor another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an\namendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates had incurred\napproximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.\n\u2022\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the aggregate dollar amount of non-reimbursable\nfunds is $98,230,402, comprised of (a) $85,646,250 representing the market value of Sponsor Shares, (b) $8,484,666 representing the market\nvalue of private placement warrants and (c) $4,099,486 of unpaid expenses incurred by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and\ntheir affiliates. Certain Alkuri directors and executive officers have indirect economic interests in the private placement warrants and in the\nSponsor Shares. This includes indirect economic interests in 25,000 Sponsor Shares held by each of Katie May and Stephen Smith and\nindirect economic interests in 30,000 Sponsor Shares held by Jason Harinstein. Jason Harinstein, Katie May and Stephen Smith are\nindependent directors of Alkuri. Envst Opportunities LLC and Works Capital LLC may be deemed to have shared beneficial ownership of\nthe Sponsor Shares and private placement warrants held directly by the Sponsor. The managing member of Envst Opportunities LLC is\nSultan Almaadeed, Alkuri\u2019s chairman. The manager of Works Capital LLC is Rich Williams, Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have agreed\nto purchase an aggregate amount of 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same\nterms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.\nThe Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors own common stock and warrants that will be worthless and have incurred reimbursable expenses\nthat may not be reimbursed or repaid if the Business Combination is not approved and that may entitle them to a greater return on their initial investment\nthan other public stockholders or holders of warrants if the Business Combination is approved.\n\u2022\nUntil the first anniversary of the Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nwill have the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.\n45\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers and the continuation of\ndirectors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the\nextent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.\nThese financial interests of the officers and directors, and entities affiliated with them, may have influenced their decision to approve the Business\nCombination. You should consider these interests when evaluating the Business Combination and the recommendation to vote in favor of the Business\nCombination Proposal and other proposals to be presented to Alkuri Stockholders.\nJefferies has a potential conflict of interest regarding the Business Combination.\nAs disclosed elsewhere herein, Jefferies served as the sole underwriter for the Alkuri IPO and will receive approximately $12.1 million of deferred\nunderwriting commissions therefrom in connection with the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s initial business combination. Jefferies has agreed to waive its\nrights to its deferred underwriting commissions held in the Trust Account in the event that Alkuri does not complete its initial business combination prior\nto the end of the completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), and in such a circumstance, will not receive any of such funds.\nAs described further below, Jefferies is also providing certain services in connection with the Transactions and will receive compensation in\nconnection therewith. Jefferies\u2019 receipt of the deferred underwriting commissions is not dependent on its provision of services in connection with the\nTransactions.\nAs discussed under \u201cProposal No. 1\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Background of the Business Combination,\u201d Jefferies is serving as\nAlkuri\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies\u2019 engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to provide\nAlkuri with financial advice and assistance in connection with the Transactions, including providing financial advice on the potential business\ncombination with Babylon Holdings, assisting Alkuri in requesting and analyzing due diligence information received from Babylon Holdings, reviewing\nfinancial information of Babylon Holdings, developing presentations for the Alkuri board of directors and providing other customary financial advisory\nand investment banking services. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies will receive a financial advisory fee of $10 million (the \u201cJefferies\nFinancial Advisory Fee\u201d). Alkuri also has agreed to provide Jefferies with customary expense reimbursement, including fees and expenses of its counsel,\nand to indemnify it and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of Jefferies\u2019 financial advisory engagement and the Transactions. No entity\n(other than Jefferies) is serving as Alkuri\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions.\nAdditionally, as discussed under \u201cProposal No. 1\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Background of the Business Combination,\u201d Jefferies is\nserving as lead placement agent in connection with the PIPE Investment together with Citi and Pareto Securities AB. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies\u2019\nplacement agent engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to assist Alkuri in (i) identifying and contacting potential PIPE Investors, (ii) preparing an\ninvestor presentation and/or marketing materials for distribution to potential PIPE Investors, (iii) soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Babylon Class\nA shares pursuant to the PIPE Investment and (iv) negotiating the financial aspects of the PIPE Investment on Alkuri\u2019s behalf. In respect of such\nservices, upon the consummation of the Transactions, the placement agents, including Jefferies, will collectively receive a placement fee equal to 3.0% of\nthe aggregate price at which such Babylon Class A shares are sold pursuant to the PIPE Investment, which is expected to be $6.9 million in the aggregate\nand of which $738,000 will be payable to Jefferies (the \u201cJefferies Placement Fee\u201d), and whether or not the Transactions are consummated, Jefferies will\n46\nTable of Contents\nreceive expense reimbursement customary for a PIPE transaction of this nature (subject to the terms and conditions of its engagement letter with Alkuri).\nAlkuri also has agreed to indemnify Jefferies and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of its placement agent engagement or information\ncontained in or omitted from the offering materials in connection with the PIPE Investment.\nBecause (i) Jefferies will only receive its deferred underwriting commissions upon the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s initial business combination during\nthe completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), (ii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Financial Advisory Fee upon the\nconsummation of the Transactions, and (iii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Placement Fee upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies\nhas an interest in the Transactions being consummated. Such interest may have presented, and may in the future present, a conflict of interest. Alkuri was\naware of and considered such potential conflicts in engaging Jefferies as its financial advisor and as lead placement agent. Alkuri\u2019s stockholders should\nconsider the role of Jefferies in evaluating \u201cProposal No. 1\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u201d and the other proposals.\nFollowing the completion of the Business Combination, the Founder will have the ability to significantly influence Babylon\u2019s business and\nmanagement.\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of Babylon Shares\nand 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power of\nBabylon\u037e (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e and (iv)\nthe existing Babylon Holdings\u2019 shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of Babylon Shares and 95.8% of the voting power of Babylon and 81.7% of the\nvoting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon will be held by the Founder). These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude\nthe impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately following the Business Combination\u037e (b) assume that no\nAlkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account and (c) exclude\nthe potential impact of the Higi acquisition. Accordingly, the Founder will be able to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval,\nincluding the election and removal of directors, the approval of actions requiring approval of the board of directors of Babylon through their voting\npower, and will retain significant influence with respect to Babylon\u2019s management, business plans and policies and corporate transactions, including the\nappointment and removal of its officers, and corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Babylon or its assets. Our Founder may in certain\ncircumstances have sufficient voting control over Babylon to amend Babylon\u2019s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights\nattached to Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder terminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control of\nBabylon following his separation and continue to have the rights described in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon.\nSubsequent to the consummation of the Business Combination, Babylon may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and\nimpairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price, which\ncould cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough Alkuri has conducted due diligence on Babylon Holdings, Alkuri cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that\nmay be present in its businesses, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that factors\noutside of Alkuri\u2019s or Babylon\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, Babylon may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its\noperations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks\nmay arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with Alkuri\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may\nbe non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on Alkuri\u2019s liquidity, the fact that Babylon Holdings or Babylon reports\n47\nTable of Contents\ncharges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about Babylon or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause\nBabylon to violate net worth or other covenants to which it may be subject. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain shareholders following\nthe Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their Babylon Shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such\nreduction in value.\nThe board of directors of Alkuri did not obtain a fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business Combination, and as a\nresult, we cannot assure you that the terms of the transaction are fair, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Alkuri.\nIn analyzing the Business Combination, the Alkuri management team conducted due diligence on Babylon Holdings and engaged in\ncomprehensive discussions regarding the terms of the transaction, including the relative ownership of Babylon following the Business Combination.\nAlkuri is not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the relative ownership of Babylon following the Business Combination is\nfair to its stockholders from a financial point of view. Based on the due diligence efforts conducted, the scope of the negotiations, input from its financial\nadvisors, and the background of its board of directors and management, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors has recommended that its stockholders approve the\nBusiness Combination and adopt the Merger Agreement and related transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors did not\nobtain a formal fairness opinion to assist it in making this recommendation.\nBabylon may redeem any unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that may be disadvantageous to the holder of such warrants, thereby\nmaking your warrants worthless.\nBabylon will have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of\n$0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of Babylon Shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share\ncapitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on each of 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day\nprior to proper notice of such redemption, and provided further that there is an effective registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable\nupon exercise of the warrants, and a current prospectus relating thereto, available throughout the 30-day redemption period, or Babylon has elected to\nrequire the exercise of the warrants on a \u201ccashless basis,\u201d and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the\nwarrants become redeemable by Babylon, it may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale\nunder all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders (i) to exercise the warrants and pay the exercise\nprice therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so, (ii) to sell the warrants at the then-current market price when the holder might otherwise\nwish to hold its warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to\nbe substantially less than the market value of the warrants. The private placement warrants are not redeemable by Babylon so long as they are held by\nthe Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nThe only principal asset of Babylon following the Business Combination will be its interest in its operating subsidiaries, and accordingly, it will\ndepend on distributions from the operating subsidiaries to pay taxes and expenses.\nUpon consummation of the Business Combination, Babylon will be a holding company and will have no material assets other than its interests in\nits operating subsidiaries. Babylon is not expected to have independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and its ability to pay taxes and\noperating expenses, as well as dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries.\nThere can be no assurance that the operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to Babylon, or that applicable law and\ncontractual restrictions, including negative covenants under any debt instruments, if applicable, will permit such distributions. If the operating\nsubsidiaries do not distribute sufficient funds to Babylon to pay its taxes or other liabilities, Babylon may default on contractual\n48\nTable of Contents\nobligations or have to borrow additional funds. In the event that the operating subsidiaries are required to borrow additional funds, it could adversely\naffect Babylon\u2019s liquidity and subject it to additional restrictions imposed by lenders.\nThe Sponsor and certain insiders of Alkuri have agreed to vote in favor of the Business Combination, regardless of how Alkuri Stockholders vote.\nThe Sponsor and certain insiders of Alkuri have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the Business Combination. The Sponsor owns 20% of\nAlkuri Common Stock prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval for the Business\nCombination will be received than would be the case if the Sponsor and certain insiders of Alkuri agreed to vote their shares in accordance with the\nmajority of the votes cast by Alkuri Stockholders.\nEven if Alkuri consummates the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that the Alkuri Warrants will be in the money at the time they\nbecome exercisable, and they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for the Alkuri Warrants is $11.50 per share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the Alkuri Warrants\nwill be in the money following the time they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, and as such, the Alkuri Warrants may expire worthless.\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete the Business Combination with Babylon or another business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as\nAlkuri Stockholders may approve), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, dissolving and liquidating. In such event,\nthird-parties may bring claims against Alkuri, and, as a result, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share liquidation\nprice received by Alkuri Stockholders could be less than $10.00 per share.\nUnder the terms of the Alkuri\u2019s certificate of incorporation, Alkuri must complete the Business Combination or another business combination by\nFebruary 9, 2023, or Alkuri must: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up\u037e (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than\nten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on\ndeposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account deposits (which interest will be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to\npay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish its public\nstockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law\u037e and (iii) as promptly\nas reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and the Alkuri board of directors, dissolve and\nliquidate, subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to its obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the\nother requirements of applicable law. There will be no liquidating distributions with respect to Alkuri Warrants, which will expire worthless. In such event,\nthird-parties may bring claims against Alkuri. Although Alkuri has obtained waiver agreements from certain vendors and service providers (other than its\nindependent auditors) it has engaged and owes money to, and the prospective target businesses it has negotiated with, whereby such parties have\nwaived any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they or other\nvendors who did not execute such waivers will not seek recourse against the trust account notwithstanding such agreements. Furthermore, there is no\nguarantee that a court will uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to claims that\ncould take priority over those of Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders.\nThe Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to Alkuri if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to it, or\na prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination\nagreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share\nheld in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00\n49\nTable of Contents\nper share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or\nprospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is\nenforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under Alkuri\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters in the Alkuri IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities\nunder the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be\nresponsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. Alkuri has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for its indemnification obligations, it has\nnot independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy such obligations, and it believes that the Sponsor\u2019s only assets are\nsecurities of Alkuri. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for Alkuri\u2019s initial business\ncombination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, Alkuri may not be able to complete its initial business\ncombination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares.\nAlkuri\u2019s directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of the Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the\ntrust account available for distribution to Alkuri Stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per public share\nheld in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust\nassets, in each case, less taxes payable, and the Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations\nrelated to a particular claim, Alkuri\u2019s independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against the Sponsor to enforce its\nindemnification obligations.\nWhile Alkuri currently expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against the Sponsor to enforce its\nindemnification obligations to Alkuri, it is possible that Alkuri\u2019s independent directors, in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary\nduties, may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If Alkuri\u2019s independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the\namount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to Alkuri Stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to Alkuri Stockholders, Alkuri files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy\npetition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of Alkuri Stockholders\nand the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Alkuri Stockholders in connection with its liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to Alkuri Stockholders, Alkuri files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy\npetition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included\nin Alkuri\u2019s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third-parties with priority over the claims of its stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy\nclaims deplete the trust account, the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Alkuri Stockholders in connection with Alkuri\u2019s liquidation\nmay be reduced.\nAlkuri Stockholders may be held liable for claims by third-parties against Alkuri to the extent of distributions received by them.\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business combination within the required time period,\nAlkuri will cease all operations, except for the purpose of winding up, liquidating and dissolving, subject to its obligations under Delaware law to provide\nfor claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Alkuri cannot assure you that it will properly assess all claims that may be potentially\nbrought against it. As such, Alkuri Stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more),\nand any liability of Alkuri Stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, Alkuri cannot assure you\nthat third parties will not seek to recover from Alkuri Stockholders amounts owed to them by Alkuri.\n50\nTable of Contents\nIf Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, any distributions received\nby stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent\nconveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by Alkuri\u2019s stockholders. Furthermore, because Alkuri intends\nto distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to its public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time period to complete an initial\nbusiness combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to its public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to\naccess to or distributions from its assets. Furthermore, the Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to Alkuri\u2019s creditors and/or\nmay have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and the company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust\naccount before addressing the claims of creditors. Alkuri cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against it for these reasons.\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we are not registering the Babylon Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under\nthe Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants,\nthus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and resell the underlying shares.\nWe are not registering the shares of Babylon Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at\nthis time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement to be entered into prior to Closing, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no\nevent later than 15 business days after the Closing of the Business Combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a\nregistration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective\nwithin 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a\ncurrent prospectus relating to those Babylon Shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for\nexample, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the\nfinancial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares\nissuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, we will be required to\npermit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the Babylon Shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based\non a formula set forth in the Warrant Agreement but, in any event, the number of Babylon Shares you will receive upon such cashless exercise will be less\nthan the number of shares that you would have received if you were able to exercise the warrants for cash. However, no warrant will be exercisable for\ncash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the\nshares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is\navailable. Notwithstanding the above, if Babylon Shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that\nthey satisfy the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants\nwho exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will\nnot be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares\nunder applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue\nsecurities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants\nunder applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or\nqualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have\nno value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price\nsolely for the Babylon Shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private\nplacement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants. In such an instance, the\nSponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the\nordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying\nordinary shares. If and when the\n51\nTable of Contents\nwarrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Babylon Shares for\nsale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to\nexercise their warrants.\nRisks Related to the Adjournment Proposal\nIf the Adjournment Proposal is not approved, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors will not have the ability to adjourn the special meeting to a later date.\nIf, at the special meeting, the chairman presiding over the special meeting determines that it would be in the best interests of Alkuri to adjourn the\nspecial meeting to give Alkuri more time to consummate the Business Combination for whatever reason (such as if the Business Combination Proposal is\nnot approved, or if Alkuri would have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon the consummation of the\nTransactions, or if additional time is needed to fulfil other closing conditions), the chairman presiding over the special meeting will seek approval to\nadjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates. If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved, the chairman will not have the ability to adjourn the\nspecial meeting to a later date in order to solicit further votes. In such event, the Business Combination would not be completed.\nRisks Related to Babylon\u2019s Business and Operations Following the Business Combination\nUnless stated otherwise, in this section, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Babylon Holdings prior to Closing and Babylon upon Closing.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception. We incurred net losses of $188.0 million and $140.3 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We incurred net losses of $75.7 million and $90.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021,\nrespectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $469.5 million and $544.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. To date, we have\nfinanced our operations principally from the sale of our equity and revenue from our operations. Our cash flow from operations was negative for the years\nended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021. We may not generate positive cash flow from operations or profitability in\nany given period, and our relatively limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and our future prospects.\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing\nindustries, including increasing expenses. We expect our costs will increase substantially in the foreseeable future and our losses will continue as we\nexpect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating as a public company. Additionally, we expect our operating\nexpenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we continue to invest in increasing our customer base, hire additional personnel, expand\nour marketing channels operations and infrastructure expand in the United States and other new geographies, pursue potential opportunities for growth\nthrough acquisitions, and continue to develop and expand our solutions. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur\nadditional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. These efforts and investments may prove to be more costly than we\nanticipate, and if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the realization of these benefits is delayed, they may not result\nin increased revenue or growth in our business to a level to sufficiently offset these higher expenses. If our growth rate were to decline significantly or\nbecome negative, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow in\nthe long term, we may require additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and/or which would be dilutive to our\nshareholders. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations would be adversely affected. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our Babylon Class A Shares.\n52\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, we may be unable to execute our business plan, adequately address competitive challenges or maintain\nour corporate culture, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nSince launching our first product in 2015, we have experienced rapid growth and we continue to rapidly and significantly expand our operations.\nFor example, our employee headcount has grown from 789 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 2,189 employees as of September 6, 2021. This expansion\nincreases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance,\nfinancial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our\nreputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.\nThe growth and expansion of our business creates significant challenges for our management, operational and financial resources. In the event of\ncontinued growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our information technology systems and our internal controls and\nprocedures may not be adequate to support our operations. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial\nand management processes and systems and to effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. As our organization continues to grow and we\nare required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our\ncorporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative solutions. This could negatively affect our business\nperformance.\nWe continue to experience growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our\noperational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees,\nand we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to\noffer, highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our\nBabylon Class A Shares may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. We face\nsignificant competition for talent from other healthcare, technology and high-growth companies, which include both large enterprises and privately-held\ncompanies. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and\nsuccessfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer,\nand our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our solutions could suffer, which could\nnegatively affect our results of operations and overall business. Further, we have made changes in the past, and will likely make changes in the future, to\nour solutions that our customers or members may not like, find useful or agree with. We may also decide to discontinue certain features, solutions or\nservices or increase fees for any of our features or services. If customers or members are unhappy with these changes, they may decrease their usage of\nour solutions.\nWe may face intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry, and if we do not maintain or\nexpand our market share our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe market for our offerings is underpenetrated, competitive, and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, customer and member\nneeds, and the frequent introduction of new products and services. While our market is in an early stage of development, it is evolving rapidly and\nbecoming increasingly competitive, and we expect it to attract increased competition. We currently face competition from a range of companies. Our\ncompetitors include companies whose primary business is developing and marketing remote healthcare platforms and services and also those engaged in\nvalue-based care, such as agilon health, Amwell, Oak Street Health, One Medical and Teladoc. We also compete with health insurers and large\ncorporations that are making inroads into the digital healthcare industry and that are increasingly focused on the development of\n53\nTable of Contents\ndigital health technology, often through initiatives and partnerships. These technology companies, which may offer their solutions at lower prices, are\ncontinuing to develop additional products and are becoming more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed healthcare providers and\ninsurance carriers have, in some cases, developed their own platform or tools and may provide these solutions to their customers at discounted prices.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to distinguish our company and our solution from our competitors and their products, and\nincludes factors such as:\n\u2022\nlong-term outcomes\u037e\n\u2022\nease of use and convenience\u037e\n\u2022\nprice\u037e\n\u2022\ngreater name and brand recognition\u037e\n\u2022\nlonger operating histories\u037e\n\u2022\ngreater market penetration\u037e\n\u2022\nlarger and more established customer and channel partner relationships\u037e\n\u2022\nlarger sales forces and more established products and networks\u037e\n\u2022\nlarger marketing budgets\u037e\n\u2022\naccess to significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources\u037e\n\u2022\nbreadth, depth, and efficacy of offerings\u037e\n\u2022\nquality and reliability of solutions\u037e and\n\u2022\nemployer, healthcare provider, government agency and insurance carrier acceptance.\nSome of our competitors may have greater name and brand recognition, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources than we do and\nmay be able to offer solutions similar to ours at more attractive prices than we can. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third\nparties with greater available resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing\nopportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In\naddition, our competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products,\ntechnologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace.\nOur partners and customers could become our competitors by offering similar services. Some of our partners may begin to offer services in the\nsame or similar manner as we do. Although there are many potential opportunities for, and applications of, these services, our partners may seek\nopportunities or target new customers in areas that may overlap with those that we have chosen to pursue. In such cases, we may potentially compete\nagainst our partners. Competition from our partners may adversely affect our relationships with our partners and our business. In addition, some of the\nterms of our partner relationships include exclusivity or other restrictive clauses that limit our ability to partner with or provide services to potential other\ncustomers or third parties, which could harm our business. We may in the future enter into agreements with customers that restrict our ability to accept\nassignments from, or render similar services to, those customers\u2019 customers, require us to obtain our customers\u2019 prior written consent to provide services\nto their customers or restrict our ability to compete with our customers, or bid for or accept any assignment for which those customers are bidding or\nnegotiating. These restrictions may hamper our ability to compete for and provide services to other customers in a specific industry in which we have\nexpertise and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n54\nTable of Contents\nNew competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies,\ngreater marketing expertise, greater financial resources and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our\ncompetitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of our market, which could create additional price pressure. In light of these factors,\neven if our solution is more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers may accept competitive solutions in lieu of purchasing\nour solution. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our existing customers do not continue or renew their contracts with us, renew at lower fee levels or decline to license additional applications and\nservices from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of existing customer contracts and sales of additional applications and\nservices to existing customers.\nCustomer renewals may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the breadth of early deployment of our solution, changes in\ncustomers\u2019 business models and use cases, our customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solution, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or\ncapabilities of products or services offered by our competitors, or the effects of economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their agreements\nwith us, or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline. If our customers are dissatisfied with our products, including, for example,\nbecause members do not engage with our solutions, our customers may terminate or decline renewal of their contracts. In particular, our customers are\noften motivated to partner with us because they believe that members\u2019 use of our solutions will decrease their spending levels. If we are not successful in\nengaging members through our platform and services, we may not meet our customers\u2019 expectations. If we fail to satisfy our existing customers, they may\nnot renew their contracts, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs part of our growth strategy we have recently focused on expanding our services amongst current customers. As a result, selling additional\napplications and services are critical to our future business, revenue growth and results of operations. Factors that may affect our ability to sell additional\napplications and services include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of our solutions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing solutions\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and sell complementary applications and services\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stability, performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare and telemedicine laws, regulations or trends\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe business environment of our customers and, in particular, headcount reductions by our customers.\nWe mainly enter into three types of contracts with our customers: value-based care, fee-for-service, and licensing. Under our fee-for-service\nagreements, we get paid by our customers based on the number of services members use through our platform and/or based on the number of members\nwho can use our platform (i.e., eligible populations). Under our value-based care agreements with health plans, we generally receive a fixed fee per month\nfor healthcare services and assume the financial responsibility for the healthcare expenses of members. Under our licensing agreements, we license our\ntechnology to third parties for them to make our technology available in certain territories and/or on their platforms. Our fee-for-service contracts\ngenerally have initial terms of one to two years and our licensing and risk-based contracts generally have initial terms of two to ten years. Most of our\ncustomers have no obligation to renew their contracts after the initial term expires. In addition, our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to\nus upon renewal, which may reduce our revenue from these customers. Our future results of operations also depend, in part, on our ability to expand our\nservice and product\n55\nTable of Contents\noffering. If our customers fail to renew their contracts, renew their contracts upon less favorable terms or at lower fee levels, or fail to license new\nproducts and services from us, our revenue may decline, or our future revenue growth may be constrained.\nIn addition, after the initial contract term, some of our customer contracts allow customers to terminate such agreements for convenience at certain\ntimes, typically with one to three months advance notice. We typically incur the expenses associated with integrating a customer\u2019s data into our\nhealthcare database and related training and support prior to recognizing meaningful revenue from such a customer. Subscription access revenue is not\nrecognized until our products are implemented for launch, which is generally a few months after contract signing. If a customer terminates its contract\nearly and revenue and cash flows expected from a customer are not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the United States and for elements of our business in the U.K., we are dependent on our relationships with physician-owned entities to hold\ncontracts and provide healthcare services We do not own such professional entities, and our business could be harmed if those relationships were\ndisrupted or if our arrangements with our providers or our customers are found to violate states laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine\nor fee-splitting.\nThere is a risk that authorities in some jurisdictions may find that our contractual relationships with the physician-owned professional entities with\nwhich we contract violate the corporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting laws or similar or equivalent rules in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws\ngenerally prohibit the practice of medicine by, or sharing of professional fees with, lay persons or entities and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons\nor entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing a clinician\u2019s professional judgment. The extent to which each state considers particular\nactions or contractual relationships to constitute improper influence of professional judgment or fee-splitting varies across the states and is subject to\nchange and to evolving interpretations by state boards of medicine, state courts and state attorneys general, among others. As such, we must monitor\nour compliance with laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate on an ongoing basis and we cannot guarantee that subsequent interpretation of the\ncorporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting laws will not circumscribe our business operations. The enforcement of state corporate practice of medicine\ndoctrines or fee-splitting laws may result in the imposition of penalties, including but not limited to, penalties on the physicians themselves for aiding the\ncorporate practice of medicine, which could discourage physicians from participating in our network of providers.\nThe corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case\nlaw, in approximately 31 states. The broad variation between state application and enforcement of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine makes an\nexact count difficult. We plan to conduct business in all of these states and are currently operating in most of them. Due to the prevalence of the\ncorporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our business, we provide administrative and\nmanagement services to certain physician-owned professional entities pursuant to agreements under which those entities reserve exclusive control and\nresponsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract with the vast majority of such physician-owned\nentities through business support agreements and direct transfer agreements for the provision of health care services, the receipt of fees, and physician-\nowner succession planning purposes. For professional entities with which we contract but with respect to which we have not implemented a direct share\ntransfer agreement, we implement other measures (e.g., option agreements) for similar succession planning purposes. For further discussion of this\nstructure, see \u201cBabylon\u2019s Business\u2014Affiliated Physicians and Healthcare Professionals.\u201d While we expect that these relationships will continue, we\ncannot guarantee that they will. A material change in our relationship with these physician-owned entities, whether resulting from a dispute among the\nentities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our consumers and could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the arrangements in which we have entered to comply with state corporate practice of medicine doctrines could subject us to additional\nscrutiny by federal and state regulatory bodies, including with respect to federal and state fraud and abuse laws. We believe that our operations comply\nwith applicable state statutes and regulations regarding corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, and anti-kickback prohibitions. However, any\nscrutiny, investigation, or litigation with regard to our arrangement with physician-owned entities could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements to comply with applicable laws\nor we are required to restructure at a significant cost, or if we were subject to penalties or other adverse action.\nOur telemedicine business and growth strategy depend on our ability to maintain and expand a network of qualified providers. If we are unable to\ndo so, our future growth would be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur success is dependent upon our continued ability to maintain an adequate network of qualified telemedicine providers. If we are unable to\nrecruit and retain board-certified physicians and other healthcare professionals, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to\ngrow and would adversely affect our results of operations. In any particular market, providers could demand higher payments or take other actions that\ncould result in higher medical costs, less attractive service for our customers or difficulty meeting applicable regulatory or accreditation requirements. Our\nability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as\nchanges in Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement levels and consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and healthcare providers, the\ncontinued private equity investment in physician practice management platforms and other market and operating pressures on healthcare providers. In\nthe United Kingdom, reports of pressures in primary medical services are starting to emerge following the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a period of\ncessation of some services in the NHS, as services resume, there is likely to be additional demand for services caused by delayed appointments,\npresentations and investigations. The demand for appropriately qualified individuals to enable us to deliver services is also likely to increase, and similar\ntrends in the demand for, and constrained supply of, appropriately qualified medical professionals may also be experienced in the United States.\nThe failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective provider contracts in the United States and to recruit qualified individuals in the United\nKingdom may result in a loss of or inability to grow our membership base, higher costs, healthcare provider network disruptions, less attractive service\nfor our customers and/or difficulty in meeting applicable regulatory requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and expand member enrollment with existing clinical services and Babylon 360 customers, our revenue\ngrowth could be slower than we expect, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from market adoption of our digital health products. As a result, widespread acceptance\nand use of digital health solutions in general, and our platform in particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the market fails to grow or\ngrows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our solutions could be negatively affected.\nOur ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new customers. If we fail to\nattract new customers and fail to maintain and expand new customer relationships, our revenue may grow more slowly than we expect, and our business\nmay be adversely affected. Demand for digital health solutions in general, and our solution in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of which\nare beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\n\u2022\nmarket adoption and ongoing usage of telemedicine solutions, in particular following the removal of various \u201cstay at home\u201d restrictions due\nto the COVID-19 pandemic\u037e\n57\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nawareness and adoption of technology in healthcare generally\u037e\n\u2022\navailability of products and services that compete with ours\u037e\n\u2022\nease of adoption and use\u037e\n\u2022\nfeatures and platform experience\u037e\n\u2022\nperformance\u037e\n\u2022\nbrand\u037e\n\u2022\nsecurity and privacy\u037e and\n\u2022\npricing.\nIn addition, our ability to increase engagement of the individual members that interact with our platform will affect our future revenue growth\u037e\nhowever, the effect that member engagement has on revenue growth depends on the type of agreement pursuant to which members engage with our\nplatform. For example, under our fee-for-service agreements, we get paid by our customers based on the number of services members use through our\nplatform and/or based on the number of members who can use our platform (i.e. eligible populations). Therefore, revenue growth under our fee-for-service\nagreements depends in part on our ability to increase engagement with members so that they will use additional services. Under our value-based care\nagreements with health plans, we generally receive a fixed fee per month for healthcare services and assume the financial responsibility for the healthcare\nexpenses of members. Under these value-based care agreements, we assume the financial responsibility of caring for members whether those members\nuse our services or not. Therefore, if members do not use our solutions and seek medical care from alternate sources, we may be unable to control the\ncosts and we may be contractually obligated to pay at least a portion of these unknown expenses, which could adversely affect our business and\noperating results. Additionally, even if we are successful engaging members and those members use our services, we may not be able to control the costs\nof healthcare in the ways that we are expecting and healthcare costs may be higher than we are anticipating. If healthcare costs through our platform are\nhigher than we are anticipating this could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of customers, and the loss of a material contract could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019\nand 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, two, four, and three customers, respectively, represented 10% or more of our total revenue. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, our top ten customers accounted for 99%, 90% and 95% of our\nrevenue, respectively.\nWe also rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to promote our solution to potential new customers. The loss of\nany of our key customers, or a failure of some of them to renew or expand their agreements, could have a significant impact on our revenue, our\nreputation and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers could lead to cancellation or non-\nrenewal of our contracts with those customers or by the acquiring or combining companies, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential\ncustomers, and their member populations.\nThe recognition of a portion of our revenue is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and healthcare cost savings and may not be\nrepresentative of revenue for future periods.\nWhile there are variations specific to each agreement, for our Babylon 360 arrangements, which operate pursuant to value-based care agreements,\nwe generally price our services based upon a per-member-per-month (\u201cPMPM\u201d) fee. We multiply this PMPM fee by the number of eligible members to\ncalculate our monthly run-rate\n58\nTable of Contents\nrevenue (\u201cMRR\u201d) for that agreement. Typically, a significant portion of the PMPM fee is fixed (we refer to this portion as the base PMPM fee), and the\nremainder of the PMPM fee is variable (we refer to this portion as the variable PMPM fee). Revenue from variable PMPM fees can be earned through\neither, or a combination of, the achievement of certain performance metrics or the realization of healthcare savings resulting from the utilization of our\nservices. Although we target achievement of these performance metrics and realization in savings of healthcare spend, our revenue and financial results\nin the future may depend on whether we earn this performance-based revenue. In addition, since our customers typically pay the full PMPM fee in\nadvance on a periodic basis, any required refund as a result of our failure to earn the performance-based revenue could have a negative impact on cash\nflows. Under some of our agreements with health plans, after conducting significant diligence and reviewing actuary and financial projections based on\nthe information that health plans (and, in England, the NHS) provide us that we ultimately do not have control over, we assume some or all of the risk that\nour cost of providing services will exceed our compensation. While we generally price our services based upon a PMPM fee, in the future we may also\nexplore other structures, such as gain/loss share arrangements which set out an investment made by Babylon in relation to a defined segment of local\npopulation, at risk, and how this will be recovered and \u201cgains\u201d or \u201closses\u201d will be shared between Babylon and the counterparty when compared against\ncontrol population.\nUnder these arrangements, if members require more care than is anticipated and/or the cost of care increases, then the aggregate fixed\ncompensation amounts, or capitation payments, may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with treatment. If medical costs and expenses exceed\nestimates, except in very limited circumstances, we will not be able to increase the fee received under these risk agreements during their then-current\nterms and we could suffer losses with respect to such agreements.\nChanges in our anticipated ratio of medical expense to revenue can significantly impact our financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately\npredict and control medical costs and expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported claims,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the expenses of our members\nmay be outside of our control in the event that members take certain actions that increase such expenses, such as unnecessary hospital visits. We are\nreliant on accurate information from reporting and health plans relating to historic and current data. Inaccuracies in such reporting could have a negative\nimpact on our financial position.\nDue to the time lag between when services are actually rendered by providers and when we receive, process, and pay a claim for those services,\nour medical expenses include a provision for claims incurred but not paid. We are continuously enhancing our process for estimating claims liability,\nwhich we monitor and refine on a periodic basis as claims receipts, payment information, and inpatient acuity information become available. As more\ncomplete information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimate, and include the changes in estimates in expenses in the period in which\nthe changes are identified. Given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that our claims liability estimate will be adequate,\nand any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact, potentially in a material way, our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, our inability to estimate our claims liability with absolute certainty or to appropriately utilize the claims data to control the cost of future\nhealthcare services may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions, further exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on our results.\nHistorically, our medical costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue have fluctuated. Factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed\nestimates include:\n\u2022\nthe health status of members and higher levels of hospitalization\u037e\n\u2022\nhigher than expected utilization of new or existing healthcare services or technologies, including the level of engagement with Babylon\u2019s\ndigital healthcare platform and tools\u037e\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise\u037e\n59\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nchanges to mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices\u037e\n\u2022\nincreased costs attributable to specialist physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in the demographics of our members\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in medical trends\u037e\n\u2022\ncontractual or claims disputes with providers, hospitals or other service providers within and outside a health plan\u2019s network\u037e\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics or acts of terrorism\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe reduction of health plan premiums.\nRenegotiation, non-renewal or termination of value-based care agreements with health plans could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUnder most of our value-based care agreements with health plans, the health plans are generally permitted to modify the respective benefits\navailable to members from time to time during the respective terms of the agreements and health plans may make other changes, such as to their utilization\nreview and coverage policies, that affect the cost of care to our attributed members. In addition, changes in government program funding, such as with\nrespect to Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage programs, can affect the revenue we receive from health plans under our value-based care\nagreements. If there is an unanticipated change to a health plan\u2019s benefits or coverage policies or to the government program funding, we could suffer\nlosses with respect to such contract. We include in many of our value-based care agreements mechanisms to protect against losses by allowing early\ntermination or amendment of the value-based care terms, but these may not protect against all adverse changes that are outside of Babylon\u2019s control or\nthey may not prevent us from suffering losses with respect to such contract.\nThere are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of revenue that we recognize under our licensing agreements and value-based care\nagreements with health plans, and if our estimates of revenue are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenue\nrecognition or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 revenue projections are based on management\u2019s expectation of executed contracts delivering revenue in line with contractual\nterms and estimates relating to amounts received under our value-based care agreements. There are significant risks associated with estimating the\namount of revenue that we recognize under our licensing agreements and value-based care agreements with health plans in a reporting period.\nCertain of our value-based care agreements relate to medical care programs that employ risk adjustment programs that impact the revenue we\nrecognize for our attributed membership. As a result of the variability of certain factors that go into the development of the risk adjustment revenue we\nrecognize, such as risk scores and other market-level factors where applicable, the actual amount of revenue could be materially more or less than our\nestimates. In the United States, the data provided to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) to determine the risk score are subject to\naudit by CMS even several years after the annual settlements occur. If the risk adjustment data we submit are found to overstate the health status of our\nmembers, we may be required to refund payments previously received by us and/or be subject to penalties or sanctions, including potential liability under\nthe federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), which can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment,\nloss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition to paybacks and civil penalties reducing our revenue in\nthe year that repayment or settlement is required, Medicare and Medicaid programs represent a large portion of our revenue in the United States and\nexclusion from future participation in these programs would significantly reduce our revenue for years to come. Further, if the data we provide to CMS\nunderstates the health risk of our members,\n60\nTable of Contents\nwe might be underpaid for the care that we must provide to our members. Consequently, our estimate of our health plans\u2019 risk scores for any period, and\nany resulting change in our accrual of revenues related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows. Some revenue risk is transferred via stop-loss policies insuring against catastrophic claims that cover most of our value-based\ncare arrangements. Similar risks apply in the U.K., including England. Gain/loss sharing with the NHS is predicated on data which is extracted and\ncontrolled by the NHS. While provisions are made to access and review this data it may not be possible to effectively challenge this.\nThe billing and collection process in the United States can be complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage\ndifferences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payer issues, such as ensuring appropriate documentation. Determining applicable\nprimary and secondary coverage for our members, together with the changes in member coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-\nintensive processes. While we manage the overall processing of some claims, we rely on third-party billing provider software to transmit the actual claims\nto payers based on the specific payer billing format. The potential therefore exists for us to experience delays or errors in claims processing when third-\nparty providers make changes to their configurations and/or invoicing systems. If claims are not submitted to payers on a timely basis or are erroneously\nsubmitted, or if we are required to switch to a different software provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process\nthese claims and receipt of payments from payers, or possibly denial of claims for lack of timely submission, which would have an adverse effect on our\nrevenue and our business. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payers. Revenues associated with these\nmedical care programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary payer that will ultimately be collectible from other\npayers paying secondary coverage, the member\u2019s commercial health plan secondary coverage or the member. Collections, refunds and payer retractions\ntypically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. If our estimates of revenues are materially inaccurate, it could\nimpact the timing and the amount of our revenue recognition and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe may be required to delay recognition of some of our revenue, which may harm our financial results in any given period.\nWe may be required to delay recognition of revenue for a significant period of time if, in relation to any agreement we enter into:\n\u2022\nthe transaction involves both current products and products that are under development\u037e\n\u2022\nthe customer requires significant modifications, configurations, or complex interfaces that could delay delivery or acceptance of our\nsolution\u037e\n\u2022\nwe are unable to demonstrate adequate control of the care management services being provided to our customers due to regulatory\nrequirements or other contractual provisions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe transaction involves acceptance criteria or other terms that may delay revenue recognition\u037e or\n\u2022\nthe transaction involves payment terms that depend upon contingencies.\nBecause of these factors and other specific revenue recognition requirements under IFRS, we must have very precise terms in our contracts to\nbegin recognizing revenue at the time when we initially provide access to our platform or provide care management services to our customers. Although\nwe strive to enter into agreements that meet the criteria under IFRS for current revenue recognition on delivered performance obligations, our agreements\nare often subject to negotiation and revisions based on the demands of our customers. The final terms of our agreements sometimes result in deferred\nrevenue recognition or an inability to recognize revenue on a gross basis, which may adversely affect our financial results in any given period.\n61\nTable of Contents\nOur sales and implementation cycle can be long and unpredictable and requires considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue\nare difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.\nThe timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle. The\nsales cycle for our solution from initial contact with a potential customer to enrollment launch varies widely by customer, ranging from less than one\nmonth to over a year. Some of our customers, especially in the case of our large customers and government entities, undertake a significant and\nprolonged evaluation process, including to determine whether our solutions meet their unique healthcare needs, which frequently involves evaluation of\nnot only our solution but also of other available solutions, which has in the past resulted in extended sales cycles. Our sales efforts involve educating\nour customers about the ease of use, technical capabilities and potential benefits of our solution. Once a customer enters into an agreement with us, we\nthen explain the benefits of our solutions again to eligible employees to encourage them to sign up as a member. During the sales cycle, we invest\nsignificant human resources and we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities, which lowers our operating margins, particularly\nif no sale occurs. For example, there may be unexpected delays in a customer\u2019s internal procurement processes, particularly for some of our larger\ncustomers and government entities for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity. There are many other\nfactors specific to customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition, including the strategic\nimportance of a particular project to a customer, budgetary constraints, funding authorization, and changes in their personnel. In addition, the\nsignificance and timing of our product enhancements, and the introduction of new products by our competitors, may also affect our customers\u2019\npurchases. Even if a customer decides to purchase our solutions, there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue, which makes\nour revenue difficult to forecast. For example, once a customer enters into an agreement with us, we work with them to identify the eligible population and\nthen launch an enrollment process. Time from signing to launch typically takes an average of at least three to six months. We do not receive any payment\nfrom our customers until members enroll and begin using our solution, which could be months following signing a subscription agreement for our\nsolution. For all of these reasons, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the\nperiod in which revenue from a sale will be recognized.\nIt is possible that in the future we may experience even longer sales cycles, more complex customer needs, higher upfront sales costs and less\npredictability in completing some of our sales as we continue to expand our direct sales force, expand into new territories and market additional solutions\nand services. If our sales cycle lengthens or our substantial upfront sales and implementation investments do not result in sufficient sales to justify our\ninvestments, our revenue could be lower than expected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur records and submissions to a health plan may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members,\nwhich could cause us to overstate or understate our revenue and subject us to various penalties or repayment obligations.\nThe claims and encounter records that we submit to health plans may impact data that support the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (\u201cRAF\u201d),\nscores attributable to members. These RAF scores determine, in part, the revenue to which the health plans and, in turn, we are entitled to receive for the\nprovision of medical care to such members. The data submitted to CMS by each health plan is based, in part, on medical charts and diagnosis codes that\nwe prepare and submit to the health plans. Each health plan generally relies on us and our affiliated physicians to appropriately document and support\nsuch RAF data in our medical records. Each health plan also relies on us and our affiliated physicians to appropriately code claims for medical services\nprovided to members. Erroneous claims and erroneous encounter records and submissions could result in inaccurate revenue and risk adjustment\npayments, which may be subject to correction or retroactive adjustment in later periods. This corrected or adjusted information may be reflected in\nfinancial statements for periods subsequent to the period in which the revenue was recorded. We might also need to refund a portion of the revenue that\nwe received, which\n62\nTable of Contents\nrefund, depending on its magnitude, could damage our relationship with the applicable health plan and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, CMS and the Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (\u201cHHS\u201d) each audit Medicare\nAdvantage (\u201cMA\u201d), plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members chosen at random. The MA plans ask providers to submit\nthe underlying documentation for members that they serve. It is possible that claims associated with members with higher RAF scores could be subject to\nmore scrutiny in a CMS, OIG, or plan audit. There is a possibility that a MA plan may seek repayment from us should CMS make any payment\nadjustments to the MA plan as a result of its or OIG\u2019s audits. The plans also may hold us liable for any penalties owed to CMS for inaccurate or\nunsupportable RAF scores provided by us or our affiliated physicians. In addition, we could be liable for penalties to the government under the FCA that\ncurrently range from $11,665 to $23,331 (but which may be adjusted in the future for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of\ndamages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim.\nOn June 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties (statutorily limited to between $5,000 and\n$10,000, as adjusted for inflation), under which the per claim range increases to a range from $11,665 to $23,331 per claim, so long as the underlying\nconduct occurred after November 2, 2015.\nCMS has indicated that payment adjustments from its Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits will not be limited to RAF scores for the specific MA\nenrollees for which errors are found but may also be extrapolated to the entire MA plan subject to a particular CMS contract. CMS has described its audit\nprocess as plan-year specific and stated that it will not extrapolate audit results for plan years prior to 2011. Because CMS has not stated otherwise, there\nis a risk that payment adjustments made as a result of one plan year\u2019s audit would be extrapolated to prior plan years after 2011.\nThere can be no assurance that a health plan will not be randomly selected or targeted for review by CMS or OIG or that the outcome of such a\nreview will not result in a material adjustment in our revenue and profitability, even if the information we submitted to the plan is accurate and\nsupportable.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by third-party payers or federal or state healthcare programs are reduced or if third-party payers or government payers\notherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to our members, our business could be harmed.\nPrivate third-party payers and government healthcare programs pay for the services that we provide to many of our members. If any commercial\nthird-party payers reduce their reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services, our business may be harmed. Third-party payers also\nare entering into sole source contracts with some healthcare providers, which could effectively limit our pool of potential members.\nPrivate third-party payers often use plan structures, such as narrow networks or tiered networks, to encourage or require their members to lower\ntheir costs. Private third-party payers generally attempt to limit their members\u2019 use of out-of-network providers by imposing higher copayment and/or\ndeductible amounts for out-of-network care than for in-network care. Additionally, private third-party payers have become increasingly aggressive in\nattempting to minimize the use of out-of-network providers by disregarding the assignment of payment from members to out-of-network providers (i.e.,\nsending payments directly to members instead of to out-of-network providers), capping out-of-network benefits payable to members, waiving out-of-\npocket payment amounts and initiating litigation against out-of-network providers for interference with contractual relationships, insurance fraud and\nviolation of state licensing and consumer protection laws. If we become out of network for private third-party payers, our business could be harmed and\nour member service revenue could be reduced because members could stop using our services.\nIn addition, a portion of our revenue comes from services provided to beneficiaries of federal, state and local government healthcare programs,\nprincipally Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n63\nTable of Contents\nPayments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and\ndeterminations, requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions, each of which could increase or decrease program payments,\nas well as affect the cost of providing service to members and the timing of payments to our physician-owned networks. We are unable to predict the\neffect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments\nas a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding COVID-19 relief legislation, may affect the availability of\ntaxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in government healthcare programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could\nadversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAs federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase, and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls, federal and state\ngovernments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes include reductions in\nreimbursement levels and to new or modified demonstration projects authorized pursuant to Medicaid waivers. Some of these changes have decreased, or\ncould decrease, the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs. In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or\nportions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government healthcare programs that reduce payments under these\nprograms may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.\nIn addition, in the U.K. (including England), primary medical services delivered under general medical services contracts are paid for in accordance\nwith the General Medical Services Statement of Financial Entitlements, which is subject to change over time. While we consider it unlikely that the\namount paid will decrease overall, as it is subject to negotiation with general practitioner representative bodies, there is nonetheless a risk that\nreimbursement of property costs for primary care service delivery may decrease or cease over time. We currently do not receive reimbursement of\nproperty costs related to Babylon GP at Hand services, our primary medical services platform in the United Kingdom\u037e however, work is ongoing to\nproperty costs related to Babylon GP at Hand services, our primary medical services platform in the United Kingdom\u037e however, work is ongoing to\nestablish whether this is possible.\nThe market for telemedicine is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, if it encounters negative\npublicity or if our solutions do not drive member engagement, the growth of our business will be harmed.\nThe telemedicine market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, consumer\nacceptance and market adoption. The COVID-19 pandemic increased acceptance and utilization of telemedicine services, but it is uncertain whether such\nincrease in demand will continue. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of our members to use, and to increase the frequency\nand extent of their utilization of, our solution, as well as on our ability to demonstrate the value of telemedicine to employers, health plans, government\nagencies and other purchasers of healthcare for beneficiaries. Negative publicity concerning our solution, other participants in the telemedicine market, or\nthe telemedicine market as a whole could limit market acceptance of our solution. If our customers and members do not perceive the benefits of our\ntelemedicine solution, or if our telemedicine solution does not drive member engagement, then our market may not develop at all, or it may develop more\nslowly than we expect. Similarly, individual and healthcare industry concerns or negative publicity regarding patient confidentiality and privacy in the\ncontext of telemedicine could limit market acceptance of our healthcare services. If any of these events occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to develop and release new solutions and services, or successful enhancements, new features and modifications to our existing\nsolutions and services, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products are based on novel technologies that are rapidly evolving. Our algorithms and other technologies depend on our ability to continue\nto build a substantial repository of health-related data and validate additional product designs. Given the rapidly evolving changing nature of our\nproducts, there is no guarantee that\n64\nTable of Contents\nwe have fully understood all the implications of using such technologies alongside the traditional delivery of healthcare. In addition, we must execute on\nour strategy to build a significant repository of health-related data to support the robustness and accuracy of our technologies and allow us to develop\nadditional artificial intelligence-enabled applications. We believe that access to contemporary and historical member data, combined with the ability to\nanalytically and clinically validate study results in a quality-controlled framework, provides us with a robust, reproducible method for product\ndevelopment. Moreover, the depth, specificity and quality of data are of paramount importance to further developing novel solutions that can\ndemonstrate clinical utility across a range of practice specialties and member demographics. These features are also central to our product strategy of\ndemonstrating both short- and long-term impact on member outcomes and health economics. If we are unable to continue to build our data repository, we\nmay not be able to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology and improve the capabilities and utility of our products, and our business could be\nharmed.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and\nenhancements, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies\ncan quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations could impact the usefulness\nof our solution and could necessitate changes or modifications to our solution to accommodate such changes. For example, the European Commission\u2019\nrecently announced proposal for a European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (which would have extraterritorial effect outside of the\nEU), could lead to enhanced requirements as to the accuracy, robustness and security of so-called \u201chigh risk\u201d AI systems used in healthcare settings. We\ninvest substantial resources in researching and developing new solutions and enhancing our solutions by incorporating additional features, improving\nfunctionality, and adding other improvements to meet our customers\u2019 and members\u2019 evolving demands. The success of any enhancements or\nimprovements to our solutions or any new solutions depends on several factors, including timely completion, competitive pricing, adequate quality\ntesting, integration with new and existing technologies in our solutions and third-party partners\u2019 technologies, effective and compliant localization for\njurisdictions in which we operate and overall market acceptance. We may not succeed in developing, marketing and delivering on a timely and cost-\neffective basis enhancements or improvements to our solutions or any new solutions that respond to continued changes in market demands or new\ncustomer requirements. Further, any enhancements or improvements to our solutions or any new solutions may not achieve market acceptance. Since\ndeveloping our solutions is complex, the timetable for the release of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions is difficult to predict, and we\nmay not offer new solutions and updates as rapidly as our customers require or expect. Any new solutions that we develop may not be introduced in a\ntimely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue.\nMoreover, even if we introduce new solutions, we may experience a decline in revenue of our existing solutions that is not offset by revenue from the new\nsolutions. For example, customers may delay making purchases of new solutions to permit them to make a more thorough evaluation of these solutions or\nuntil industry and marketplace reviews become widely available. Some customers may hesitate to migrate to a new solution due to concerns regarding the\nperformance of the new solution. In addition, we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor\u2019s products and services. This could result in a\ntemporary or permanent revenue shortfall and adversely affect our business.\nThe introduction of new products and solutions by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies within the digital health market\nwhich could serve to replace existing offerings could make our solutions obsolete or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. We may experience difficulties with software development, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or\nimplementation of additional features or capabilities. In addition, there may be other delays or barriers to introducing new products or features relating to\nregulation. If customers and members do not widely purchase and adopt our solutions, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we do\nnot accurately anticipate customer and member demand, if we are unable to develop, license or acquire new features and capabilities on a timely and cost-\neffective basis, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, we may encounter adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance or\nclaims by customers or\n65\nTable of Contents\nmembers brought against us. Each of these possible effects could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe expect to continue to dedicate significant financial and other resources to our research and development efforts in order to continuously\nevolve the development of our products and maintain our competitive position. As a result, our business is significantly dependent on our ability to\nsuccessfully complete the development of our next generation products. Investing in research and development personnel, developing new products and\nenhancing existing products is expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that such activities will result in successful development of our\nproducts, significant new marketable products or enhancements to our products, design improvements, cost savings, revenues or other expected\nbenefits. If we spend significant time and effort on research and development and are unable to generate an adequate return on our investment, our\nbusiness and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur proprietary solutions may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us, or divert application of our\nresources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development of proprietary technology is time-consuming, expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter\ntechnical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems or design defects that prevent our proprietary solutions from operating\nproperly. If our solutions do not function reliably, malfunction, or fail to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert\nliability claims against us or attempt to terminate their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain\ncustomers.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be\ndiscovered after the solution has been used by our members. Any real or perceived errors, failures, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our\nsolution could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. It could also result in loss of customers, loss of members, loss of or delay in\nmarket acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position, loss of revenue or liability for damages, overpayments and/or underpayments, any of\nwhich could harm our enrollment rates. In such an event, we may be required or may choose to expend additional resources in order to help correct the\nproblem. Such efforts could be costly, or ultimately unsuccessful. Even if we are successful at remediating issues, we may experience irreversible damage\nto our reputation and brand. There can be no assurance that provisions typically included in our agreements with customers that attempt to limit our\nexposure to claims would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Even if\nunsuccessful, a claim brought against us by any customers would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend and could seriously damage our\nreputation and brand.\nIf our products do not effectively interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing and future infrastructures, installations could be delayed or cancelled,\nwhich would harm our business.\nOur products must effectively interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing or future IT or application infrastructures, which often have different\nspecifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors and contain multiple generations of products that have been\nadded over time. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 infrastructure or problematic network\nconfigurations or settings, we may have to modify our software so that our products will interoperate with our customers\u2019 infrastructure and business\nprocesses. In addition, to stay competitive within certain markets, we may be required to make software modifications in future releases to comply with\nnew statutory or regulatory requirements. Further, in order to move into new markets and serve new customers globally, we may be required to modify our\nexisting software in order to comply with existing statutory or regulatory regimes that exist in those markets. These issues could result in additional time\nand expenditure to modify our offering, longer sales cycles for our products and order cancellations, all of which would adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n66\nTable of Contents\nOur relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risk of your\ninvestment.\nOur relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and plan for our future growth. All of our\ngrowth has occurred in recent years. Babylon Holdings was formed in 2013, in 2014 became the first large-scale provider to be registered with the Care\nQuality Commission (\u201cCQC\u201d), the independent regulator of health and social care in England, and in 2015 began providing clinical services through our\nvirtual care platform offering diagnosis, advice and treatments via medical professionals to members on a remote basis. We first provided NHS services\nusing the Babylon GP at Hand risk-based model in the United Kingdom in 2017, and we entered into our first value-based care agreements with health\nplans in the United States in 2020. As such, we have limited experience providing services and managing contracts centered around a value-based care\nmodel, especially in the United States.\nWe have encountered, and will continue to encounter, significant risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by new and growing companies in\nrapidly changing industries. These include determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market adoption of our existing and future\nsolutions, competition from other companies, acquiring and retaining customers, managing customer deployments, overseeing member enrollment, hiring,\nintegrating, training and retaining skilled personnel, developing new solutions, determining prices for our solutions, unforeseen expenses, and challenges\nin forecasting accuracy. If we have difficulty launching new solutions or increasing member enrollment, our revenue and our ability to achieve and\nsustain profitability would be impaired. Additional risks include our ability to effectively manage growth and process, store, protect and use personal\ndata in compliance with governmental regulation, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security globally. If our\nassumptions regarding these and other similar risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change as we gain more\nexperience operating our business or due to changes in our industry, or if we do not address these challenges successfully, our operating and financial\nresults could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe depend on our talent to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, integrate, develop, motivate and retain our personnel, we\nmay not be able to grow effectively.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management in sales, services, engineering, marketing,\noperations, finance and support functions, especially in the London metropolitan area and in the United States, including in the Bay Area, where we\nrecently expanded our operations. For year ended December 31, 2020, we increased our global headcount of all employment types to 2,089 employees and\n1678 full time employees globally. As of September 6, our global headcounts of all employment types and full time employees were 2,189 and 1,864\nemployees, respectively. Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry, and the loss of even a few qualified employees, or an inability to\nattract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could harm our operating results and\nimpair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program for key executive officers\nand other employees and a discretionary bonus scheme for the general employee population. These measures may not be enough to attract and retain the\npersonnel we require to operate our business effectively.\nThe technology industry generally experiences a significant rate of turnover of its workforce. There is a limited pool of individuals who have the\nskills and training needed to help us grow our company. As we continue to grow, we may be unable to continue to attract or retain the personnel we need\nto maintain our competitive position. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining our best talent. Competition for these\nresources, particularly for engineers, is intense. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new and existing\nemployees and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent, our ability to achieve our\nstrategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be harmed. The loss of one or more of our key\n67\nTable of Contents\nemployees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for those key employees, could seriously harm our business.\nEmployees may be more likely to leave us if the shares of our capital stock they own or the shares of our capital stock underlying their equity incentive\nawards have significantly reduced in value or the vested shares of our capital stock they own or vested shares of our capital stock underlying their\nequity incentive awards have significantly appreciated.\nIn addition, our future depends on the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel, each of whom would be\ndifficult to replace. In particular, Dr. Ali Parsadoust, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, is critical to our future vision and strategic direction. We rely\non our leadership team in the areas of operations, research and development, marketing, sales, and general and administrative functions. Although we\nhave entered into employment agreements or offer letters with our key employees, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will\nemployment, and we do not maintain key person life insurance for some of our key employees. We are only entitled to one or three months\u2019 prior notice if\nDr. Ali Parsadoust or Charlie Steel, our Chief Financial Officer, respectively, intend to terminate their employment with us and two to four weeks\u2019 prior\nnotice if any of our other senior executives intend to terminate their respective employment with us. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes\nin our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior management team, including any new hires that we may make, fail to\nwork together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nharmed. Further, if our Founder were to terminate his employment or be terminated for cause, he would retain voting control of our company following his\nseparation.\nWhile we do include post-termination restrictions in our standard employment contracts and cross-train employees where possible to maintain\noperational knowledge and experience, if any of our senior management team or key employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may\nlose customers, suppliers, know-how and staff members to them. In addition, if any of our sales executives or other sales personnel, who generally\nmaintain close relationships with our customers, joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers to that company, and our\nrevenue may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge, business practices\nor procedures by such personnel. Any non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key\nemployees might not provide effective protection to us in light of legal uncertainties associated with the enforceability of such agreements.\nOur profitability and the cost of providing our services are affected by our utilization rates of our employees in our various locations. If we are not\nable to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our employees involved in the delivery of our services, our profit margin and our profitability may suffer.\nOur utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to promptly transition our employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and integrate new employees\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate number of employees in each of our delivery locations\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to deploy employees with appropriate skills and seniority to projects\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to manage the attrition of our employees\u037e and\n\u2022\nour need to devote time and resources to training, professional development and other activities that cannot be billed to our customers.\nOur revenue could also suffer if we misjudge demand patterns and do not recruit sufficient employees to satisfy demand. Employee shortages\ncould prevent us from completing our contractual commitments in a timely manner and cause us to lose contracts or customers. Further, to the extent that\nwe lack sufficient employees with lower levels of seniority and daily or hourly rates, we may be required to deploy more senior employees with higher\nrates on projects without the ability to pass such higher rates along to our customers, which could adversely affect our profit margin and profitability.\n68\nTable of Contents\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our ordinary shares.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, net loss and cash flows, has varied and may vary significantly in the future, and period-\nto-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result\nof a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of customers\u037e\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal rates and the timing and terms of customer renewals\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in our sales and implementation cycles, especially in the case of our large customers\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing or fee policies or those of our competitors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenue\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully expand our business, whether domestically or internationally, and to introduce new services and solutions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and\ninfrastructure, including upfront capital expenditures and other costs related to expanding in existing markets or entering new markets, as\nwell as providing administrative and operational services to our physician owned entity partners\u037e\n\u2022\nnetwork or service outages, internet disruptions, the availability of our platforms, security breaches or perceived security breaches\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage the size and composition of our network of healthcare professionals relative to the level of demand for\nservices from our customers\u2019 members and patients\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in our business strategies and pricing policies (or those of our competitors)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of our entry into new markets or introductions of new or enhanced platforms or solutions by us or our competitors,\nincluding disruptive technology, or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation or new entrants\namong competitors, market participants or strategic alliances\u037e\n\u2022\nnew, or changes to existing, regulations that limit or affect our platforms, solutions and technologies or which increase our regulatory\ncompliance costs, including with respect to privacy or data protection,\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cost and potential outcomes of ongoing or future regulatory investigations or examinations, or enforcement by government regulators,\nincluding fines, orders or consent decrees, or of future litigation\u037e\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political, social, industry and market conditions\u037e\n\u2022\nduration and severity of pandemics, epidemics, contageious diseases, flu and the like\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment\nof goodwill from acquired companies.\nMost of our revenue in any given quarter is derived from contracts entered into with our customers during previous quarters. Consequently, a\ndecline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such declines, however, would\nnegatively affect our revenue in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales of and market demand for our solution, and potential\nchanges in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our licensing model also\nmakes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue through additional sales in any\n69\nTable of Contents\nperiod, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contract. Accordingly, the effect of changes in the industry\nimpacting our business or changes we experience in our new sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations. Any fluctuation in our\nquarterly results may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our ordinary\nshares.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with our international\noperations.\nWe have employees located in the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore and Rwanda. Our platform is available in the United States, United\nKingdom, Africa, 11 territories in Southeast Asia, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. We may further expand our international operations in the future. We have\ninvested significant resources in our international operations and expect to continue to do so in the future. An important part of targeting international\nmarkets is increasing our brand awareness and establishing relationships with customers internationally. However, there are certain risks inherent in\ndoing business in international markets, particularly in the healthcare industry, which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlocal economic, political and social conditions, including the possibility of economic slowdowns, hyperinflationary conditions, political\ninstability, social unrest or outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as Ebola, Zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS), H1N1 (swine flu), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\n(MERS)\u037e\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, export and\nimport restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses\u037e\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approvals or clearances where required for the sale of our solution and services in various countries\u037e\n\u2022\nrequirements to maintain data and the processing of that data on servers located within the United States or in other such countries we may\noperate in\u037e\n\u2022\nprotecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights\u037e\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers\u037e\n\u2022\ncompetition from companies with significant market share in our market, with greater resources than we have and with a better\nunderstanding of user preferences\u037e\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the effect of local and regional financial pressures\non demand and payment for our products and services and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe inability to manage and coordinate the various legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving\nand subject to change\u037e\n\u2022\nactual or threatened trade war, including between the United States and China, or other governmental action related to tariffs, international\ntrade agreements or trade policies\u037e\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency policies or practices and restrictions on currency conversion\u037e\n\u2022\nlimitations or restrictions on the repatriation or other transfer of funds\u037e\n\u2022\nthe inability to enforce agreements, collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with differing commercial laws\u037e\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of\ntrade, and other market restrictions\u037e and\n70\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nmanaging the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations,\nincluding anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\nEntry into certain transactions with foreign entities may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment\nby U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our\nability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy.\nOur overall success and ability to continue to expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks\nand there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so without incurring unexpected or increased costs. If we are not able to manage the risks related\nto our international operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In certain regions, the\ndegree of these risks may be higher due to more volatile economic, political or social conditions, less developed and predictable legal and regulatory\nregimes and increased potential for various types of adverse governmental action. Our ability to continue to expand our business and to attract talented\nemployees, customers and members in various international markets will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business. Entering new international markets is expensive, our ability to successfully gain market\nacceptance or establish a robust customer base in any particular market is uncertain. Further, the potential distraction this could cause our senior\nmanagement team could lead to other areas of our operations being neglected and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic uncertainty or downturns, particularly as it impacts particular industries, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn recent years, the United States, the United Kingdom and other significant markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic\nconditions remain uncertain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic uncertainty, political uncertainty, including as a result of the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union, or Brexit, and the associated macroeconomic and employment conditions and national and local\ngovernment responses thereto make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could\ncause our customers to slow spending on our solution, which could delay and lengthen sales cycles. In connection with Brexit, changes to health\nlegislation have been proposed. While we believe that many of the proposed changes are likely to have taken place regardless of Brexit, some changes,\nincluding to procurement law, may be impacted more widely than otherwise. Furthermore, during uncertain economic times our customers may face issues\ngaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may\nbe required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts or bad debts and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. In particular, legal,\npolitical and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit may be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations,\nadversely affect our operations in the United Kingdom and pose additional risks to our business, revenue, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes to health legislation are proposed and, while much of this is likely to have taken place regardless of Brexit, some changes, including\nto procurement law, may be impacted more widely than otherwise.\nFurthermore, we have customers in a variety of different industries. A significant downturn in the economic activity attributable to any particular\nindustry may cause organizations to react by reducing their capital and operating expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on\nhealthcare matters. In addition, our customers may delay or cancel healthcare projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. To\nthe extent purchases of our solution are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately\naffected by delays or reductions in general healthcare spending. Also, competitors, especially those who have more significant resources or additional\nsector offerings\n71\nTable of Contents\nthan we do, may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Congress, CMS and other federal agencies with oversight of care delivery requirements\nmade several changes in the manner in which Medicare will pay for telemedicine visits, many of which relax previous requirements, including site\nrequirements for both the providers and members, telemedicine modality requirements and others. State laws and regulations applicable to telemedicine,\nparticularly licensure requirements, also were relaxed in many jurisdictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These relaxed regulations have allowed\nus to continue operating our business and delivering care to our members predominantly through telemedicine modalities. Nearly all of the Federal\nmeasures will expire at the end of the Public Health Emergency declaration, which the Biden administration has indicated will last through the end of 2021.\nMany State law and regulatory changes have already expired while others have continued. It is unclear which, if any, of these changes will remain in place\npermanently and which will be rolled-back following the COVID-19 pandemic, although there have been a number of state law and regulatory changes\nover the past year that clarify requirements or remove impediments. If regulations change to restrict our ability to or prohibit us from delivering care or\nreceiving reimbursement for care delivered through telemedicine modalities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn England, reports of pressures in primary services are starting to emerge following the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a period of cessation of some\nservices in the NHS and a restart, there is likely to be additional demand for NHS services caused by delayed appointments, delayed presentations,\ninvestigations. This could result in an increased demand for U.K. non-NHS services, which could result in Babylon GP at Hand experiencing cost\npressures.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or any industry in particular.\nIf the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe believe that our future growth will depend on the continued development of our direct sales force and its ability to obtain new customers and\nto manage our existing customer base. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. It\ncan take some time from their initial date of hire before a new sales representative is fully trained and productive. Additionally, if we cannot retain\nmembers of our direct sales force then this will impact our business adversely, given we will lose trained members and have to spend a corresponding\namount of time on hiring and training replacements. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to expand and train our direct sales force do not\ngenerate a corresponding increase in revenue. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain sufficient numbers of productive direct sales\npersonnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, sales of our services will suffer\nand our growth will be impeded.\nWe may make investments into or acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our\nshareholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty integrating any such acquisitions successfully or realizing the\nanticipated benefits therefrom, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe made investments in Health Innovators Inc. (d/b/a DayToDay) (\u201cDayToDay\u201d) in 2019 and Higi in 2020, and our affiliates acquired the assets of\nFirst Choice Medical Group in 2020 and the entire issued share capital of the Meritage Medical Network. In the future, we may seek to acquire or invest in\nbusinesses, applications, services, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our existing and future offerings, enhance our technical\ncapabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur\nvarious expenses in identifying, investigating, and\n72\nTable of Contents\npursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and may have\ndifficulty integrating acquired businesses or assets, or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. If we acquire additional\nbusinesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business\nfollowing the acquisition. Integration may prove to be difficult due to the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds,\ndifferent geographical locations and who may be accustomed to different corporate cultures.\nWe also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ninability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner\u037e\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities, including legal liabilities, associated with the acquisition\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our current and future offerings and contract terms, including disparities\nin the revenue model of the acquired company\u037e\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention or resources from other business concerns\u037e\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our existing business relationships with customers, members, or strategic partners as a result of the acquisition\u037e\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the geographic separation of the combined businesses and consolidating multiple physical\nlocations\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees\u037e\n\u2022\nacquisition targets not having as robust internal controls over financial reporting as would be expected of a public company\u037e\n\u2022\nus becoming subject to new regulations as a result of an acquisition, including if we acquire a business serving customers in a regulated\nindustry or acquire a business with customers or operations in a country in which we do not already operate\u037e\n\u2022\npossible cash flow interruption or loss of revenue as a result of transitional matters\u037e and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nWe may issue equity securities or incur indebtedness to pay for any such acquisition or investment, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of\ntheir ownership interests and the per share value of our ordinary shares to decline.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible\nassets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to\ntake charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third-parties that may not result\nin the development of commercially viable solutions or the generation of significant future revenues.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnerships\nor other arrangements to provide our services develop products and to pursue new markets. Proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, in-\nlicensing arrangements, joint\n73\nTable of Contents\nventures, strategic alliances or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial,\nmarketing, sales, technology or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure, or\ncomplete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We have limited institutional\nknowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such\ntransaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of products or services that achieve commercial success\nor result in significant revenues and could be terminated prior to developing any products. Additionally, while as a matter of good practice, we prioritize\ncommercially appropriate ownership and licensing of intellectual property rights, contractual negotiations may result in us not owning, or jointly owning\nwith a third party, the intellectual property rights in products and other works developed under our collaborations, joint ventures, strategic alliances or\npartnerships.\nAdditionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create\nthe potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our future collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may\nbecome, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the\nachievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations or\nthe ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any future collaborators, they may act in\ntheir self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we may have limited control over\nthe amount and timing of resources that any future collaborators devote to our or their future products. Disputes between us and our collaborators may\nresult in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and\narrangements will be contractual in nature and will generally be terminable under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not\ncontinue to have rights to the products or services resulting from such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.\nAdditionally, as would be standard for collaborations of such nature, we may have indemnity obligations in respect of, amongst other things, intellectual\nproperty and data privacy obligations, which, if triggered, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are currently party to, and may enter into future, in-bound intellectual property license agreements. We may not be able to fully protect the\nintellectual property licensed to us or maintain those licenses. Our licensors may retain the right to prosecute, enforce and defend the intellectual\nproperty rights licensed to us, in which case we would depend on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property\nprotection for the licensed intellectual property. These licensors may determine not to enforce the licensed intellectual property against other companies\nor may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. In addition, such licenses may only provide us with non-exclusive rights, which could\nallow other third parties, including our competitors, to utilize the licensed intellectual property rights. Further, our in-bound license agreements may\nimpose various diligence, commercialization, payment or other obligations on us. Our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement\nwith them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license, which could adversely affect our freedom to operation or our competitive business position and\nharm our business prospects.\nOur use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our solutions and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in connection with our existing and future offerings. Some of these licenses may contain requirements that we make\navailable source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or\nderivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third-parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of\ncertain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available\nunder open source licenses, if we combine and/or distribute our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. Although we have a\npolicy on how open source software\n74\nTable of Contents\nmay be used in our offering, and we monitor our use of open source software, we cannot be sure that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in\nour proprietary software, that our programmers have not incorporated into our proprietary software open source software subject to such unfavorable\nlicense terms, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been\ninterpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. There is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated\nconditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our existing and future offerings to our customers and members. In addition, the terms of open source\nsoftware licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such open source software, to others, including our competitors, on\nunfavorable license terms. As a result of our current or future use of open source software, we may face claims or litigation, be required to release our\nproprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our technology, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be\naccomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could harm our\nbusiness.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events and man-made problems, such as power disruptions, data security breaches and incidents,\nand terrorism.\nOur systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from the occurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, or\nother weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunction, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or incident of mass\nviolence, which could result in lengthy interruptions in access to our platform. Acts of terrorism, including malicious internet-based activity, could cause\ndisruptions to the internet or the economy as a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, access to our platform could be interrupted. If our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to deliver our platform and solution to our\ncustomers and members would be impaired or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to successfully execute on our disaster recovery and business\ncontinuity plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe have implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery program designed to effectively manage business interruption and continually\nevolving. Specifically, our architecture is designed in availability zones to enable continuity when one or more zones is disrupted by moving traffic in the\nevent of a problem, and the ability to recover in a short period of time. However, should our disaster recovery program fail to effectively support the\nmovement of traffic in a timely or complete manner in the event of a catastrophe, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to\nour business, financial condition and results of operations that may result from interruptions in access to our platform as a result of system failures.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States, the United Kingdom or worldwide, including the outbreak of the\nnovel strain of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, could adversely affect our business.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurs in the United States, the United Kingdom or worldwide, our business may be\nadversely affected. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain and rapidly changing. As of the date of this\nproxy statement/prospectus, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition remains\nuncertain. Furthermore, because of our business model, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations\nand overall financial condition until future periods.\nAdverse market conditions resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially adversely affect our business and the value of our ordinary\nshares. Numerous state and local jurisdictions, including all markets where we operate, have imposed, and others in the future may impose, \u201cshelter-in-\nplace\u201d orders, quarantines, executive\n75\nTable of Contents\norders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions have resulted in\nlargely remote operations at our headquarters and centers, work stoppages among some vendors and suppliers, slowdowns and delays, travel\nrestrictions and cancellation of events and have restricted the ability of our front-line outreach teams to host and attend community events, among other\neffects, thereby significantly and negatively impacting our operations. Other disruptions or potential disruptions include restrictions on the ability of our\npersonnel to travel\u037e inability of our suppliers to manufacture goods and to deliver these to us on a timely basis, or at all\u037e inventory shortages or\nobsolescence\u037e delays in actions of regulatory bodies\u037e diversion of or limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the\noperations of our business, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with groups of\npeople\u037e business adjustments or disruptions of certain third parties\u037e and additional government requirements or other incremental mitigation efforts. The\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,\nincluding new information which may emerge concerning the severity and spread of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact,\namong others. In addition, the COVID-19 virus disproportionately impacts older adults, which describes many of our members.\nIt is not currently possible to reliably project the direct impact of COVID-19 on our operating revenues and expenses. Key factors include the\nduration and extent of the outbreak in our service areas as well as societal and governmental responses. Members may continue to be reluctant to seek\nnecessary care given the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could have the effect of deterring healthcare costs that we will need to incur to later\nperiods and may also affect the health of members who defer treatment, which may cause our costs to increase in the future. Further, as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we may experience slowed growth or a decline in new member demand. We also may experience increased internal and third-party\nmedical costs as we provide care for members suffering from COVID-19. This increase in costs may be significant given the number of our members who\nare under capitation agreements. There is also a risk that, as restrictions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic are rolled back, our medical expenses may\nincrease in the near-to-medium term as individuals who may have delayed getting routine medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic begin making\nappointments to do so. Further, we may face increased competition due to changes to our competitors\u2019 products and services, including modifications to\ntheir terms, conditions, and pricing that could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial condition in future\nperiods.\nDuring 2020, we temporarily closed all of our corporate offices, and enabled our entire corporate work force to work remotely, the majority of which\nstill does. We also made operational changes to the staffing and operations of our centers to minimize potential exposure to COVID-19. We have also\nimplemented travel restrictions for non-essential business. If the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, especially in regions where we have offices or centers, our\nbusiness activities originating from affected areas could be adversely affected. Disruptive activities could include business closures in impacted areas,\nfurther restrictions on our employees\u2019 and service providers\u2019 ability to travel, impacts to productivity if our employees or their family members experience\nhealth issues, and potential delays in hiring and onboarding of new employees. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be\nrequired by any global authorities where we operate or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees. Such measures could negatively\naffect our sales and marketing efforts, sales cycles, employee productivity, or customer retention, any of which could harm our financial condition and\nbusiness operations.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to document the health conditions of our members as completely as we have in the past.\nMedicare pays capitation using a \u201crisk adjustment model,\u201d which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual member.\nPayers with higher acuity members receive more, and those with lower acuity members receive less. Medicare requires that a member\u2019s health issues be\ndocumented annually regardless of the permanence of the underlying causes. Historically, this documentation was required to be completed during an in-\nperson visit with a member. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, Medicare is allowing documentation for\nconditions identified during video visits with members. However, given the disruption caused by COVID-19, it is unclear whether we will be\n76\nTable of Contents\nable to document the health conditions of our members as comprehensively as we did in prior years, which may adversely impact our revenue in future\nperiods.\nAlso, under the CARES Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services distributed Medicare Grants to healthcare providers to offset the\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic related expenses and lost revenues, also known as the Provider Relief Funds. Grants received are subject to the terms\nand conditions of the program, including that such funds may only be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and will\nreimburse only for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recipients are not required to repay\nthese funds, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including not using the funds to reimburse expenses or losses\nthat other sources are obligated to reimburse. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Funds,\nincluding demonstrating that the distributions received have been used for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the COVID-19\npandemic. If we are unable to attest to or comply with current or future terms and conditions our ability to retain some or all of the distributions received\nmay be impacted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also cause our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers, which are critical\nto our infrastructure, to shut down their business, experience security incidents that impact our business, delay or disrupt performance or delivery of\nservices, or experience interference with the supply chain of hardware required by their systems and services, any of which could materially adversely\naffect our business. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in our employees and those of many of our vendors working from home and\nconducting work via the internet, and if the network and infrastructure of internet providers becomes overburdened by increased usage or is otherwise\nunreliable or unavailable, our employees\u2019, and our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 employees\u2019, access to the internet to conduct business could be negatively\nimpacted. Limitations on access or disruptions to services or goods provided by or to some of our suppliers and vendors upon which our platform and\nbusiness operations relies, could interrupt our ability to provide our platform, decrease the productivity of our workforce, and significantly harm our\nbusiness operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform and the other systems or networks used in our business may experience an increase in attempted cyber-attacks, targeted intrusion,\nransomware, and phishing campaigns seeking to take advantage of shifts to employees working remotely using their household or personal internet\nnetworks and to leverage fears promulgated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of any of these unauthorized attempts could substantially impact\nour platform, the proprietary and other confidential data contained therein or otherwise stored or processed in our operations, and ultimately our\nbusiness. Any actual or perceived security incident also may cause us to incur increased expenses to improve our security controls and to remediate\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\nThe extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments, including: the duration and\nspread of the outbreak\u037e government responses to the pandemic\u037e the impact on our customers and our sales cycles\u037e the impact on customer, industry, or\nemployee events\u037e and the effect on our partners and supply chains, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Because of our business model,\nthe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial condition until future periods.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the\nother risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including but not limited to those relating to cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities, interruptions\nor delays due to third-parties, or our ability to raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows necessary to expand our operations.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on the repatriation of cash could adversely affect our results of operations, financial\nposition and cash flows.\nOur business is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates. Although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we operate in different geographical\nareas and transact in a range of currencies in addition to the U.S.\n77\nTable of Contents\ndollar, such as pound sterling. As a result, movements in exchange rates may cause our revenue and expenses to fluctuate, impacting our profitability,\nfinancial position and cash flows. Future business operations and opportunities, including any continued expansion of our business outside the United\nStates, may further increase the risk that cash flows resulting from these activities may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. In\nthe event we are unable to offset these risks, there may be a material adverse impact on our business and operations. In appropriate circumstances where\nwe are unable to naturally offset our exposure to these currency risks, we may enter into derivative transactions to reduce such exposures. Even where\nwe implement hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations\nand involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential\naccounting implications. Nevertheless, exchange rate fluctuations may either increase or decrease our revenues and expenses as reported in U.S. dollars.\nMoreover, foreign governments may restrict transfers of cash out of the country and control exchange rates. There can be no assurance that we will be\nable to repatriate earnings generated, or cash held, by Babylon Holdings and its subsidiaries due to exchange control restrictions or the requirements to\nhold cash locally to meet regulatory solvency requirements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAny failure to offer high-quality implementation, member enrollment and ongoing support may adversely affect our relationships with our\ncustomers, and in turn our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThough we assist with targeted marketing campaigns, we do not control our customers\u2019 enrollment schedules. As a result, if our customers do not\nallocate the internal resources necessary for a successful enrollment for their population, or enrollment launch date is delayed, we could incur significant\ncosts, our enrollment rate may decline, customers could become dissatisfied and decide not to increase utilization of our solution or not to implement our\nsolution beyond an initial period prior to their term commitment. In addition, competitors with more efficient operating models and/or lower\nimplementation costs could jeopardize our customer relationships.\nIn implementing and using our solutions, our members depend on our member support to resolve issues in a timely manner. We may be unable to\nrespond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for member support. We also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and\ndelivery of our services or member support to compete with changes in solutions provided by our competitors. Increased member demand for support\ncould increase costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our sales are highly dependent on our reputation and on\npositive recommendations from our existing members, and customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality member support, or a market perception that\nwe do not maintain high-quality member support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our solutions, and in turn our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges,\nincluding the need to develop new products, services or enhance our existing products or services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. In order to achieve these objectives, we may make future commitments of capital resources. Accordingly,\nwe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. In particular, if the closing of the Business Combination is delayed longer\nthan we expect, we may need to raise additional funding in advance of such closing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights,\npreferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our ordinary shares. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive\ncovenants relating to our capital raising activities\n78\nTable of Contents\nand other financial and operational matters. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our\nability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIn the United States, we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, or if\nthe rules and regulations change or the approach that regulators take in classifying our products and services under such regulations change, we\ncould incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and\nregulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payers, our\ncontractual relationships with our providers, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular\nimportance are:\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from\nreferring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or a member of\nsuch physician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation\narrangement) with the entity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services\u037e\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate\nor other remuneration (i) in return for referring or to induce the referral of an individual for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of\nitems or services paid for in whole or in part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) ordering, leasing,\npurchasing or recommending or arranging for the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items, services, good, or facility paid for in whole or in\npart by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the\nstatute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or\nservices resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False\nClaims Act\u037e\n\u2022\nthe criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or\nfraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-\nKickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed\na violation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act that imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that, among other things, knowingly submit false or\nfraudulent claims for payment to the government, or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim\npaid, or retain identified Medicare or Medicaid overpayments and allows for qui tam or whistleblower suits by private individuals on behalf\nof the government\u037e\n\u2022\nvarious federal healthcare-focused criminal laws that impose criminal liability for intentionally submitting false or fraudulent claims, or\nmaking false statements, to the government\u037e\n\u2022\nreassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the\nMedicare or Medicaid programs\u037e\n79\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nsimilar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services\nreimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or\nengaging in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies requiring certain modality and other actions to establish a provider-patient\nrelationship, deliver care, or prescribe medications as part of a telehealth service\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations and policies relating to licensure and the practice of telehealth services across state lines\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding the dispensing or delivery of medications and devices\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding reporting requirements and patient consent, education, and follow-up\nrelated to treatment, including treatment and education for certain specific topics, such as, contraception, HIV and other STIs and state\nreporting for HIV, STI, and infectious diseases\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices\u037e\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act that imposes penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments\u037e\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the\nservices are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of\nservices rendered\u037e and\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to enroll and\nparticipate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these\nprograms.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our\nbusiness activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Babylon has implemented a compliance program to maintain compliance\nwith these laws, however instances of non-compliance may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal\npenalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid\nprograms. Medicare and Medicaid programs represent a large portion of our revenue in the United States and exclusion from future participation in these\nprograms would significantly reduce our revenue for years to come. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by\nthe fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety\nof interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations,\neven if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our\nbusiness and result in adverse publicity.\nTo enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the OIG have recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare\nproviders, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations\ncan be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our\ncosts or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for\n80\nTable of Contents\nlarge monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or\nstatement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of\ntreble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of\na consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that\nthe government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers\u2019 compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules\nand fraud and abuse laws.\nThe laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you\nthat any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review\nof our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our\noperations.\nThe impact of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but\nmay adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue is dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry\nis subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences.\nIn the United States, the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and increased access to\nhealth insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States. Since the adoption of ACA, there have been an increased\nthe number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, increasingly, reimbursement policies tie payment to quality, alternative payment\nmethodologies, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program, have been adopted or piloted, enforcement of fraud and abuse laws have increased and\nutilized expanded powers adopted as a part of ACA and the use of information technology has been encouraged.\nAlthough ACA has remained largely intact in the face of multiple challenges, Federal agencies, Congress, states and other regulatory bodies have\nthe ability to impact the extent of the changes implemented by ACA. Accordingly, the full impact of ACA remains unknown, and we cannot predict future\nactions by Federal agencies, Congress, the states and other regulatory bodies may impact the changes implemented by ACA. We expect that additional\nstate and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and\nother third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nEvolving government regulations may result in increased costs or adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or reinterpretation of various laws\nand regulations. Compliance with these future laws and regulations may require us to change our practices at an undeterminable and possibly significant\ninitial monetary and recurring expense. These additional monetary expenditures may increase future overhead, which could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations.\nWe have identified what we believe are the areas of government regulation that, if changed, would be costly to us. These include:\n\u2022\nrules governing the practice of medicine by physicians\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws relating to licensure requirements for physicians and other licensed health professionals\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws limiting the corporate practice of medicine and professional fee-splitting\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws governing the issuances of prescriptions in an online setting\u037e\n81\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\ncybersecurity and privacy laws\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws and licensure requirements relating to telemedicine\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws and regulatory requirements relating to artificial intelligence (which are likely to become more prominent across multiple jurisdictions in\nthe coming years, following the European Commission\u2019s recently announced proposal for an EU Regulation on Artificial Intelligence)\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws and regulatory requirements relating to medical devices including software as a medical device, under English law, EU law and the\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration\u2019s enforcement discretion relating to \u201cdevice\u201d regulatory\nrequirements\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations relating to the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs\nand private payers (e.g., the physician self-referral law or Anti-Kickback Statute)\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations related to the acceptance of risk for medical expenses\u037e and\n\u2022\nlaws and rules relating to the distinction between independent contractors and employees. There could be laws and regulations applicable\nto our business that we have not identified or that, if changed, may be costly to us, and we cannot predict all the ways in which\nimplementation of such laws and regulations may affect us.\nChanges in law or regulation in any jurisdiction in which we operate may lead to increased costs and/or resourcing requirements, delays, or may\nrequire product features to be modified or discontinued. As an example, the current up-classification of many software as a medical device products in\nEurope as a result of the recently enforced Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 places a burden on manufacturers who CE-mark their products, including\nBabylon.\nMoreover, there is an increasing trend in the European Union, United Kingdom and United States towards regulation of AI and the protection of\ncitizens from harm caused by AI, although no specific substantive legislation has been enacted to date.\nEuropean Union\n\u2022\nOn April 21, 2021, the European Commission published its proposal for an EU Regulation on AI (the \u201cDraft Regulation\u201d). The Draft Regulation is\nnot current EU law. It will proceed through a detailed legislative process (which is expected to take several years) and, if enacted, will also provide\nfor a transition period to enable affected parties to comply. As with previous EU legislation relating to technology (such as the GDPR), it is likely\nthat the final text will be significantly different from the Draft Regulation.\n\u2022\nThe Draft Regulation applies to providers, users, importers and distributors of AI systems. It establishes a risk-based framework of requirements\nand enforcement mechanisms for various AI use-cases. This includes \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems, which (among other criteria) encompass products or\ncomponents that are subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices.\n\u2022\nThe Draft Regulation, if enacted, would have extra-territorial effect and would apply to:\n\u25cb\nproviders (established within or outside the EU) that supply or put an AI system into service in the EU\u037e\n\u25cb\nusers of AI systems located within the EU\u037e and\n\u25cb\nproviders and users located outside the EU, if the output produced by the AI system is used in the EU.\n\u2022\nBabylon\u2019s mobile app (including its AI-driven digital health tools, Triage and Healthcheck) is currently available for download within the EU.\nBabylon could be determined to be a provider, given that it develops the app and puts it onto the market.\n\u2022\nIf Babylon were determined to be a provider of high-risk AI systems, its substantive obligations would include (among other measures)\nimplementation of compliant risk-management and data governance\n82\nTable of Contents\nsystems, creation and maintenance of technical documentation, record-keeping requirements, detailed transparency obligations and post-market\nmonitoring. Although Babylon has many of these in place already, the specific requirements may vary. The Draft Regulation also requires high-risk\nAI systems to be CE-marked following a conformity assessment procedure. These measures could create additional costs (e.g. additional hires for\nproduct and compliance teams) and potential delays in the development and deployment of Babylon\u2019s AI-based products and services within the\nEU. If Babylon were to fail to comply, Babylon may be subject to fines or other penalties.\n\u2022\nCertain obligations in the Draft Regulation apply to users\u2019 of high-risk AI systems, which could include Babylon\u2019s commercial partners and\nlicensees. A user is any entity or person under whose authority a provider\u2019s AI system is operated (rather than a human end-user). These\nobligations include ensuring input data is relevant for the intended purpose, monitoring the operation of the AI system and keeping logs generated\nby the system. As a result, Babylon may be required to implement additional operational procedures and contractual protections (with potentially\nnegative impacts on commercial partnership and licensing revenues) to enable its partners and licensees to comply with their own obligations when\nusing Babylon\u2019s AI.\n\u2022\nIf Babylon were not determined to be a provider of high-risk AI systems, it could still be required to adhere to certain transparency standards under\nthe Draft Regulation.\nUnited Kingdom\n\u2022\nThe Draft Regulation would not be part of UK law in light of Brexit. However, it would apply indirectly to parties in the UK through the extra-\nterritorial effect detailed above (i.e., UK-based providers/users would need to comply if supplying or using AI systems, or their output, within the\nEU). Babylon\u2019s mobile app is currently available for download in the EU. The UK government is expected to publish a national AI strategy in 2021,\nbut at this stage it is not possible to determine the United Kingdom\u2019s legislative and regulatory position in relation to AI or the impact on Babylon\u2019s\nbusiness of any future measures that may be implemented.\nUnited States\n\u2022\nPolicy and legislative developments in the United States over the past two years suggest a greater focus on the regulation of AI, with a particular\nemphasis on algorithmic accountability and mitigation of algorithmic bias/discrimination.\n\u2022\nThe Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (No. 13,859) (issued on February 11, 2019), included a guiding\nprinciple of \u201cfostering public trust and confidence in AI technologies\u201d. House Resolution 153 on Supporting the Development of Guidelines for\nEthical Development of Artificial Intelligence (issued by the U.S. House of Representatives on February 27, 2019 but not yet adopted) sets out aims\nfor the \u201csafe, responsible and democratic development\u201d of AI, through principles such as transparency, privacy, accountability, access, fairness\nand safety.\n\u2022\nThe most significant legislative development was the introduction in Congress of the bill for the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act on April\n10, 2019 (the Bill\u201d), which would require independent impact assessments to be conducted on \u201chigh-risk automated decision systems\u201d to assess\ntheir accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy and security, where the relevant organization meets certain threshold criteria (based on\nrevenue, volume of data held, or the sale/purchase of personal information). The Bill did not advance in 2019, but there are indications that it will be\nreintroduced in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021.\n\u2022\nIf enacted and if applicable to Babylon, the Bill\u2019s requirement to carry out detailed impact assessments could create additional costs (including\nadditional hires for compliance teams) and delays in Babylon\u2019s engineering and product development processes. The Bill would also not prevent\nthe introduction of further legislation at state level which might, if applicable, impose additional (potentially separate or overlapping)\n83\nTable of Contents\nrequirements on Babylon. An early example is the bill for the New Jersey Algorithmic Accountability Act (introduced on May 20, 2019), which is\nsimilar in scope and effect to the Bill and is still moving through the New Jersey legislative process.\nIn the jurisdictions in which we operate, even where we believe we are in compliance with all applicable laws, due to the uncertain regulatory\nenvironment, certain jurisdictions may determine that we are in violation of their laws. In the event that we must remedy such violations, we may be\nrequired to modify our services and products in a manner that undermines our solution\u2019s attractiveness to our customers, consumers or providers or\nexperts, we may become subject to fines or other penalties or, if we determine that the requirements to operate in compliance in such jurisdictions are\noverly burdensome, we may elect to terminate our operations in such places. In each case, our revenue may decline and our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the introduction of new services may require us to comply with additional, yet undetermined, laws and regulations. Compliance may\nrequire obtaining appropriate licenses or certificates, increasing our security measures and expending additional resources to monitor developments in\napplicable rules and ensure compliance. The failure to adequately comply with these future laws and regulations may delay or possibly prevent some of\nour products or services from being offered to customers, or their members and patients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to the regulatory environment and market for health insurance in the United States could affect the adoption of our products and services\nand our future revenue.\nOur business interacts closely with the U.S. health insurance system, which is evolving and subject to a changing regulatory environment. Our\nfuture financial performance will depend in part on growth in the market for private health insurance, as well as our ability to adapt to regulatory\ndevelopments.\nChanges and developments in the health insurance system in the United States could reduce demand for our services and harm our business. For\nexample, there has been an ongoing national debate relating to the health insurance system in the United States. Certain elected officials have introduced\nproposals to expand the Medicare program, ranging from proposals that would create a new single-payer national health insurance program for all United\nStates residents, replacing virtually all other sources of public and private insurance, to more incremental approaches, such as lowering the age of\neligibility for the Medicare program, expanding Medicare to a larger population, or creating a new public health insurance option that would compete with\nprivate insurers. Additionally, proposals to establish a single-payer or government-run health care system at the state level have been introduced in some\nof our key states, such as New York and California. At the federal level, President Biden and Congress may consider other legislation and/or executive\norders to change elements of the ACA. In December 2019, a federal appeals court held that the individual mandate portion of the ACA was\nunconstitutional and left open the question whether the remaining provisions of the ACA would be valid without the individual mandate. On November\n10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this matter, and in June 2021, the Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no\nlegal standing to challenge the ACA, upholding the ACA. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order that states it is the policy of\nhis administration to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the ACA, and to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable to all Americans, and\ndirects the Secretary of HHS to consider opening a special enrollment period for uninsured and under-insured Americans to seek individual market\ncoverage through the federal health insurance marketplace. On the same day, in response to the President\u2019s Executive Order, the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), announced a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021, which has been extended to August\n15, 2021 due to the coronavirus public health emergency, for uninsured and under- insured individuals and families to seek coverage through the federal\nhealth insurance marketplace. The Executive Order also directs federal agencies to examine agency actions to determine whether they are consistent with\nthat the Administration\u2019s commitment regarding the ACA, and begin rulemaking to suspend, revise, or rescind any inconsistent actions. Areas of focus\ninclude policies or practices that may reduce affordability of coverage, present unnecessary barriers to individuals\n84\nTable of Contents\nand families attempting to access Medicare or ACA coverage, or undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. We continue to evaluate\nthe effect that the ACA and its possible modifications, repeal and replacement may have on our business.\nThere may also be changes on the state level that could adversely impact our business. For example, the California Department of Health Care\nServices (\u201cDHCS\u201d), is anticipated to begin the process of recontracting with Medi-Cal managed care plans in 2021. If the Medi-Cal managed care plans\nthat we currently contract with change as a result of this DHCS request for proposal and procurement process, and we are unable to secure new contracts\nwith the new Medi-Cal managed care plans, the demand in our services may decrease and harm our business.\nOpposition in the United Kingdom to the involvement of private sector providers in the delivery of healthcare services could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur business in England interacts closely with the NHS, including through our delivery of our Babylon GP at Hand offering. The involvement of\nindependent sector providers in the NHS is a regularly discussed topic. Independent providers have long played a role in the delivery of services in the\nNHS. Whilst we are unaware that a central record of independent sector spend by the NHS is retained, critics claim that spend in this area has increased\nover time and undermines the NHS core values. In the recent past, both Labour and Conservative governments have used independent providers to\nincrease patient choice and competition, as well as increasing capacity to provide services. In recent years, there have been large scale attempts to\nprocure services from providers which have included independent sector providers which have received criticism and created delays. Tenders and\ncontracts have been abandoned, and the debate on the \u201cprivatization of the NHS\u201d has come from local stakeholders including patients, the public and\nphysicians, as well as being a political topic. It is unlikely that the \u201cprivatization of the NHS\u201d narrative will entirely subside. It will remain a risk to our\nbusiness and it is likely that significant changes to the state of play of health in the United States may become part of the commentary in this debate.\nIn February 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care in England published a White Paper titled \u201cIntegration and Innovation: working\ntogether to improve health and social care for all\u201d, or the NHS White Paper, which sets out proposals for health and care legislation. The NHS White\nPaper brings together proposals that build on recommendations from the NHS system and additional measures relating to the Secretary of State for\nHealth\u2019s powers over the system. The NHS White Paper is detailed with broad proposals including working together and integration\u037e stripping out\nbureaucracy\u037e enhancing public confidence and accountability\u037e and additional proposals to support public health, social care, quality and safety. There is\nvery little or no detail in the NHS White Paper regarding independent sector providers of health and care services in England. Notably, there is a proposal\nto remove the commissioning of NHS and public health services from the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, to be replaced by a bespoke Provider\nSelection Regime and a duty on commissioners (purchasers) of NHS services to act in the best interests of members. The procurement of non-clinical\nservices will remain subject to the procurement rules. The Provider Selection Regime, if implemented as proposed to date, may make it easier for decision\nmakers not to award contracts through open, competitive procurement processes and that poorly performing services may remain unimproved. The\nmechanism for challenge is likely to be through judicial review. There appears, at this stage, to be a move to strengthen the \u201cAny Qualified Provider\u201d or\n\u201cAQP\u201d arrangements which may be beneficial to providers of health services. We continue to evaluate the impact of the NHS White Paper and its\npossible amendments to existing legislation and NHS guidance on our business.\nIn February 2021, the NHS Commissioning Board, an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of Health and Social\nCare, issued a consultation on proposals for the NHS Provider Selection Regime. The consultation has now closed, and further detail is awaited as\nregards the future of NHS clinical and public health service commissioning. In the meantime, there is uncertainty as pertains to the future of procurement\nlegislation.\nIn addition, there is a risk that the NHS Commissioning Board could challenge how the Babylon GP at Hand contractual structure operates, or that\nthe legislation regarding the persons eligible to enter into a general medical\n85\nTable of Contents\nservices contract could change such that the contractual structure does not comply with legislation. The Babylon GP at Hand contractual structure is\nreliant on four individuals holding the general medical services contract in their individual capacity. While Babylon has broad control regarding two of\nthese individuals, we are reliant on our working relationship with the other two. We believe that our operations are in line with other corporate entities\ndelivering general medical services in England\u037e however, any scrutiny, investigation, or litigation with regard to our arrangement could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements\nto comply with applicable laws or we are required to restructure at a significant cost, or if we were subject to penalties or other adverse action.\nWe are subject to export and import control laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to\nliability if we violate such laws and regulations.\nWe and our products in many cases are subject to U.S. import and export controls and trade and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S.\nExport Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and solutions to certain countries,\ngovernments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Exports of our products and services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations\nwhen applicable. If in the future we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal penalties,\nincluding loss of export privileges and substantial fines for us and for the individuals working for us.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and\nlicensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solution or permit the use of our platform in those countries.\nChanges in our solution, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our members with international operations from deploying\nour platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change\nin export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by\nsuch regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or\npotential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solution would likely\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments\nof the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions\nand embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations,\ncollectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. While we have mechanisms to identify high-risk individuals and entities before contracting with them,\nan instance of non-compliance with all such applicable laws could result in our being subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other\nsanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of such laws by United Kingdom, United\nStates or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws.\nFailure to comply with these laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\nof 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. domestic bribery statute at\n86\nTable of Contents\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws that apply in countries where we do business. The\nBribery Act, the FCPA and these other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and our employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and\nthird-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of\nvalue, to recipients in the public or private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.\nWe sometimes leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing\nto prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners our third-party\nintermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may\nbe held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if\nwe do not explicitly authorize those activities. While we have mechanisms to identify high-risk individuals and entities before contracting with them, we\noperate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations. We cannot assure you that all of our employees,\nagents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will not take actions that violate applicable law, for which we may be ultimately\nheld responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nThese laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent\nany such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with those laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees,\nagents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions that violate our policies and applicable law, for which we may be\nultimately held responsible. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international\noperations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nAny allegations or violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws\ncould result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage,\ninvestigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from government contracts, all of which may have\nan adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a\nmaterially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nFailure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results.\nIn many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to\nensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned in each jurisdiction and are taxed accordingly. Although we believe that we are in\nsubstantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer\npricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed. In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may\nor may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in tax legislation or policies in different geographic jurisdictions including the United Kingdom\nand the United States could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. Our consolidated effective income tax rate could be materially\nadversely affected by several factors, including: changing tax laws,\n87\nTable of Contents\nregulations and treaties, or the interpretation thereof\u037e tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration (such as those related to the Organization for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, project, the European Commission\u2019s state aid\ninvestigations and other initiatives)\u037e the practices of tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate\u037e the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or\nexaminations and any related interest or penalties. Such changes may include (but are not limited to) the taxation of operating income, investment income,\ndividends received or (in the specific context of withholding tax) dividends, royalties and interest paid.\nWe are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but\nsuch changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase the\nestimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheets, and otherwise affect our financial position, future results\nof operations, cash flows in a particular period and overall or effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations, reduce post-tax\nreturns to our shareholders and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance.\nThe applicability of value-added, sales, use, withholding and other tax laws or regulations on our business is uncertain. Adverse tax laws or\nregulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could subject us to additional tax liability and related\ninterest and penalties, increase the costs of our solution and adversely impact our business.\nThe application of tax laws and regulations to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use, value-added or other tax laws,\nstatutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or\ndisproportionately to services provided over the internet or could otherwise materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, different tax jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value-added and other taxes, and these rules and\nregulations can be complex and are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or\nordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect). Although our customer contracts\ntypically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes, our customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and associated\ninterest or penalties, or we may determine that it would not be commercially feasible to seek reimbursement. In addition, we or our customers could be\nrequired to pay additional tax amounts on both future as well as prior sales, and possibly fines or penalties and interest for past due taxes. If we are\nrequired to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, and if the amount we are required to collect and pay exceeds our estimates\nand reserves, or if we are unsuccessful in collecting such amounts from our customers, we could incur potentially substantial unplanned expenses,\nthereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. Imposition of such taxes on our services going forward or collection of sales tax from\nour customers in respect of prior sales could also adversely affect our sales activity and have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nFurthermore, a tax authority may disagree with tax positions that we have taken, which could result in increased tax liabilities. For example, Her\nMajesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs, or HMRC, or another tax authority could challenge our allocation of income by tax jurisdiction and the amounts paid\nbetween our affiliated companies pursuant to our intercompany arrangements and transfer pricing policies, including methodologies for valuing\ndeveloped technology and amounts paid with respect to our intellectual property development. Similarly, a tax authority could assert that we are subject\nto tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d under\ninternational tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, a tax\nauthority may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interest and penalties are payable by us, where there has been a technical violation of\ncontradictory laws and regulations that are relatively new and have not been subject to extensive review or interpretation, in which case we expect that\nwe might contest such\n88\nTable of Contents\nassessment. High-profile companies can be particularly vulnerable to aggressive application of unclear requirements. Many companies must negotiate\ntheir tax bills with tax inspectors who may demand higher taxes than applicable law appears to provide. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy\nand costly and if we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could increase our anticipated effective tax rate, where applicable.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Legal Proceedings\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology or if the scope of our intellectual property\nprotection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar to ours, and our ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on internally developed technology and content, including software, databases, confidential information and know-how, the\nprotection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of registered and unregistered rights, including patents and\nregistered trademarks, as well as trade-secret and copyright laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights in our internally developed technology and content, as well as our brand. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our\nintellectual property through additional patent, trademark and other intellectual property filings. Effective patent, trade-secret, copyright and trademark\nprotection is expensive and time-consuming to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of\ndefending our rights. These measures, however, may not be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection.\nMuch of our technology and software is maintained as trade secret and not protected by patents. Our employees, consultants and other parties\n(including independent contractors and companies with which we conduct business) may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secret\ninformation or technology to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally disclosed or obtained and is using any of our internally developed\ninformation, technology or content is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United\nStates are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure, confidentiality\nand assignment-of-invention agreements (or equivalent contractual provisions) with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and\ncompanies with which we conduct business to protect our trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property and internally developed information.\nThese agreements may not be self-executing (i.e., they may require further legislative or judicial action before they can take effect or become enforceable),\nor they may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach. Moreover, third parties may independently develop similar or\nequivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access, whether authorized or unauthorized, to our trade secrets, know-how and other internally\ndeveloped information.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and other IP and other proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be\nharmed, as third parties may be able to commercialize and use technologies and software products that are substantially the same as ours without\nincurring the development and/or licensing costs that we have incurred. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged,\ninvalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Any of our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an\nunauthorized manner to third parties or otherwise misappropriated. In addition, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide us with\nfreedom to operate or technology that will permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide us with competitive advantages,\nwhich could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain offerings or other competitive harm.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we may seek to analyze our competitors\u2019 services,\nand may in the future seek to enforce our intellectual property against\n89\nTable of Contents\npotential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent infringement or\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual\nproperty. Any inability to meaningfully protect or assert our intellectual property rights could result in harm to our ability to compete and reduce demand\nfor our technology. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and\nbusiness opportunities.\nUncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts\nand agencies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual\nproperty rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage. Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could\ntherefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of\nwhich would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize our services and use our internally developed technology without\ninfringing the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition to suffer. As the market for digital healthcare, both in the United States and globally, expands and\nmore patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our technology of which we are not aware or that\nwe must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Whether merited or not, we may face allegations that we, our customers or other\nparties indemnified by us have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nSuch claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun\npurchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements. We may also face\nallegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties. It may\nbe necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party intellectual property\nor proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. We may not be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such adversarial proceedings or\nlitigation. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us we may be required to engage in or to continue claims, regardless\nof whether such claims have merit. This can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and financial resources and can be costly to evaluate and\ndefend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our technology, obtain licenses, modify\nour services and technology while we develop non-infringing substitutes or incur substantial damages, settlement costs or face a temporary or\npermanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected services (which may cause us to breach contractual obligations). If we\nrequire a third-party license, it may not be available, either on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or\ngrant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights relating to our products, services or solutions. We may also have to redesign our products, services or\nsolutions so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and\ntime, during which our technology may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs,\nthe indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed\ntechnology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or obtain similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be\nadversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. We\nare not currently subject to any claims from third parties asserting infringement\n90\nTable of Contents\nof their intellectual property rights. Some third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they\nhave substantially greater resources. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause\nus to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be\npublic announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive\nthese results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares. Moreover, any uncertainties resulting from the\ninitiation and continuation of any legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our\noperations. Assertions by third parties that we infringe or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses and may require us to pay significant\ndamages if not covered by insurance.\nOur business entails the risk of medical liability claims against both our providers and us. We carry insurance (and in relation to clinical negligence\nclaims in the United Kingdom arising from care delivered within Babylon GP at Hand NHS primary medical services, we are indemnified by a national\nstate-backed indemnity scheme under NHS Resolution) covering medical malpractice claims in amounts that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks\nattendant to our business and/or as required under applicable law, and the physician-owned entities with which we partner carry insurance for\nthemselves and each of their healthcare professionals (our providers). However, successful medical liability claims could result in substantial damage\nawards that exceed the limits of our and our providers\u2019 insurance coverage. In addition, professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance\npremiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our services. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be\navailable to our providers or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all.\nAny claims made against us that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage awards against\nus and divert the attention of our management and our providers from our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims may adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe have been and may in the future become subject to litigation or regulatory investigation, which could harm our business.\nOur business entails the risk of liability claims against us, and we have been and may in the future become subject to litigation. Claims against us\nmay be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of parties, including our customers, our members, vendors of our customers, government agencies, our\ncurrent or former employees, our shareholders, or the entities in which we invest and/or their shareholders. We expect there to be an increase in litigation\nrelated to employer practices and healthcare in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and\npotentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, covered by adequate insurance. Although we carry public liability and\nproduct liability insurance, as well as medical malpractice insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate considering the risks attendant to our\nbusiness, successful claims could result in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. In addition, any determination\nthat we are acting in the capacity of a healthcare provider, or exercising undue influence or control over a healthcare provider, or any adverse\ndetermination by a data privacy authority in respect of our users\u2019 data, may subject us to claims not covered by our insurance coverage, or could result in\nsignificant sanctions against us and our clinicians, additional compliance requirements, expense, and liability to us. In addition, insurance coverage is\nexpensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our solutions. As a result, adequate coverage may\nnot be available to us or to our providers in the future at acceptable costs or at all. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously\u037e however, we\ncannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of some of these types of matters against us may result\nin our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements\n91\nTable of Contents\nexceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby harming our business and per share trading price of our ordinary\nshares. For example, fines or assessments could be levied against us under domestic or foreign data privacy laws (such as HIPAA, the GDPR, or the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d)) or under authority of privacy enforcing governmental entities (such as the Federal Trade Commission\n(\u201cFTC\u201d), or the HHS) or as a result of private actions, such as class actions based on data breaches or based on private rights of action (such as that\ncontained in the CCPA). Additionally, a successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim against us could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition.\nCertain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely\nimpact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and adversely impact our ability to attract directors\nand officers. In addition, such litigation could result in increased scrutiny by government authorities having authority over our business, such as the\nFTC, the HHS, Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d), and state attorneys general.\nIn England, Babylon and Babylon GP at Hand are both registered providers with the CQC. In the event of enforcement action arising from a clinical\nincident by either provider, there is a risk of fines. These can be modest Fixed Penalty Fines (for example for noncompliance with notification deadlines, or\nan administrative step in relation to duty of candor)\u037e however, if they relate to matters of safe care, fines can be more significant and relate to the\nprovider\u2019s turnover. This is ring-fenced to the legal entity that is registered, but remains a risk for any healthcare provider registered with the CQC. Other\nregulators in the sector continue to present a fines risk, for example the Health and Safety executive, for non-clinical care incidents, and the U.K.\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office for data breaches or noncompliance with information law legislation.\nBabylon is also subject to various regulations as to the use of certain medical technology. In certain jurisdictions, the rules governing the\napplication of Babylon\u2019s technology may not align with the nature of Babylon\u2019s products and services, in which case Babylon may incur costs and\ndelays in obtaining clearances in those markets or penalties for failure to conform to certain registration requirements. For example, we have in the past\nand expect to continue to have interactions with the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency about the proper classification of certain\nof our products and services, which may result in requiring us to register different products and services or changing, reducing functionality of or access\nto certain of our products and services.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Data\nSecurity breaches and incidents, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or members, or\nprevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, use and disclose sensitive data, including protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d), and other\ntypes of personal data or personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). We also process and store, and use additional third parties to process and store,\nsensitive information including intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of our members and customers. Our\nmember information is encrypted but not always de-identified and/or anonymized. We manage and maintain our solution and data utilizing a combination\nof on-site systems, managed data center systems and cloud-based computing center systems.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to securely process, transmit and store this\ncritical information. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar\nbreaches, and employee or contractor error, negligence or malfeasance, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure or\nmodifications of confidential information, causing member health information to be accessed or acquired\n92\nTable of Contents\nwithout authorization or to become publicly available. We utilize third-party service providers for important aspects of the collection, storage and\ntransmission of customer, user and member information, and other confidential and sensitive information, and therefore rely on third parties to manage\nfunctions that have material cybersecurity risks. Because of the sensitivity of the PHI, other PII, and other confidential information we and our service\nproviders collect, store, transmit, and otherwise process, the security of our technology platform and other aspects of our services, including those\nprovided or facilitated by our third-party service providers, are important to our operations and business strategy. We take certain administrative,\nphysical and technological safeguards to address these risks, such as by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle customer, user and member\ninformation for us to enter into agreements that contractually obligate those subcontractors to use reasonable efforts to safeguard PHI, other PII, and\nother sensitive information. In addition, Babylon Holdings\u2019 audit committee, which reports to Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, has historically been\nresponsible for overseeing our cybersecurity risk management processes. Our audit committee is responsible for reviewing our policies with respect to\ndata protection and cybersecurity risk assessment and risk management. Measures taken to protect our systems and those of our subcontractors, or the\nPHI, other PII, or other sensitive data we or our subcontractors process or maintain, may not adequately protect us from the risks associated with the\ncollection, storage and transmission of such information. Although we take steps to help protect confidential and other sensitive information from\nunauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure or those of our subcontractors may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers\nor viruses, failures or breaches due to third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance or other disruptions.\nA privacy or data protection violation, or a security breach or incident, that leads to disclosure or unauthorized use, modification of, or other\nprocessing, or that prevents access to or otherwise impacts the confidentiality, security, or integrity of, member information, including PHI or other PII, or\nother sensitive information we or our subcontractors maintain or otherwise process, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with breach\nnotification laws, cause us to incur significant costs for remediation, fines, penalties, notification to individuals and for measures intended to repair or\nreplace systems or technology and to prevent future occurrences, potential increases in insurance premiums, and require us to verify the accuracy of\ndatabase contents, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we are unable to prevent such security breaches or privacy violations or implement\nsatisfactory remedial measures, or if it is perceived that we have been unable to do so, our operations could be disrupted, we may be unable to provide\naccess to our platform, and could suffer a loss of customers or users or a decrease in the use of our platform, and we may suffer loss of reputation, harm\nto our market position, adverse impacts on customer, user and investor confidence, financial loss, governmental investigations or other actions,\nregulatory or contractual penalties, and other claims and liability. In addition, security breaches and incidents and other inappropriate access to, or\nacquisition or processing of, information can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying such incident, mitigating and otherwise responding to any\nincidents, or in providing any notification of such incidents may lead to increased harm. Finally, insurance market conditions are evolving given the\nextent of security incidents creating premium and coverage availability risk.\nAny such breach or incident, or disruption to or interruption of our systems or any of our third-party information technology partners, could\ncompromise our networks or data security processes, disrupt our operations, and sensitive information could be destroyed, corrupted, or inaccessible or\ncould be accessed, obtained, or disclosed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such interruption in access, improper access,\ndisclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy of member\ninformation or other personal information, such as HIPAA, the GDPR, the DPA 2018, and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d), and\nregulatory fines or penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to perform our services,\nprovide member assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide\ninformation about our current and future solutions and engage in other user and clinician education and outreach efforts. Any such breach or incident\ncould also result in the loss or compromise of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could adversely affect our business and\ncompetitive position. While we maintain insurance\n93\nTable of Contents\ncovering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all\nliability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.\nOur use, disclosure, and other processing of information relating to individuals, including health information, is subject to HIPAA, the GDPR, the\nDPA 2018, the U.K. GDPR, and other privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with those laws and\nregulations or to adequately secure the information we hold and that is processed in our business could result in significant liability or reputational\nharm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, member base and revenue.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity,\nand other processing of PHI and PII. These laws and regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for\nthe protection of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered\nentities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Babylon\u2019s U.S. entities that directly provide healthcare\nservices are covered entities under HIPAA. Babylon U.S. entities are both covered entities under HIPAA and business association under HIPAA. We\nexecute business associate agreements with our customers.\nHIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or\ndisclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of\nstandard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare\ntransactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.\nHIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations start at $100 per\nviolation and are not to exceed $50,000 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.5 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. However,\na single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their\nresidents. Courts may award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private\nright of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil\nsuits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.\nIn addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates for\ncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were\nthe victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.\nHIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that\ncompromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees\nor authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days\nafter discovery of the breach.\u201d If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the\nname of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the\nlocal media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.\nIn addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and\nsecurity of PHI and other types of PII. These laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its\nimplementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing\n94\nTable of Contents\ninterpretations, and we expect new laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in\nthe future.\nFor example, the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), provides new data privacy rights for California residents. The\nenforcement of the CCPA by the California Attorney General commenced July 1, 2020. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or\noperations, but we may be required to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in connection with\nour compliance or the compliance of our customers, service providers, or other third parties. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties and a private right\nof action for violations, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act\n(\u201cCPRA\u201d), was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor\ndevelopments related to the CPRA, and anticipate needing to incur additional costs and expenses associated with compliance with CPRA compliance.\nOther U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these\nareas. Many obligations under the CCPA and these other laws and legislative proposals remain uncertain, and we cannot fully predict their impact on our\nbusiness. If we fail to comply with any of these laws or standards, we may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions, civil litigation, fines and\nother penalties, all of which may generate negative publicity and have a negative impact on our business.\nOutside of the United States, we, along with a significant number of our customers, are subject to laws, rules, regulations, guidance and industry\nstandards related to data privacy and cyber security, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection,\nretention or transfer of data. For example, the GDPR and, now that the U.K. has exited the EU, the DPA 2018 and the U.K. GDPR, contain numerous\nrequirements and changes from previous European Union law, including more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers and heavier\ndocumentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the\nEU were introduced, including greater control over personal data by data subjects (e.g., the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU\nconsumers, data breach notification requirements (which differ to those listed under HIPAA above and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR, the\nData Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. GDPR, fines of up to \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million in the UK) or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the\nnoncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for certain violations. The GDPR and Data Protection 2018 requirements apply not only to\nthird-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. Depending on the\ncontractual relationship with out relevant counterparty, we are required to comply with the GDPR and the DPA 2018 as a \u201cData Controller\u201d and a \u201cData\nProcessor\u201d as appropriate. In 2018, we appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee and supervise our compliance with GDPR and the DPA 2018 data\nprotection regulations. As a result of various changes in relation to European data transfer rules existing and future transfers of European originated\npersonal data will have to be assessed and possibly revisited to take into consideration the changes. This is likely to trigger specific remediation costs\nand expenses in 2021 and 2022.\nGlobally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards\ncovering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, online, the use of data to inform\nmarketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use,\nprocessing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. For example, in addition to the GDPR, the\nEuropean Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process that focuses on a person\u2019s right to conduct a private life. The proposed\nlegislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the \u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d) would replace the current ePrivacy Directive.\nOriginally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still being negotiated. Most recently, on\nFebruary 10, 2021, the Council of the EU agreed on its\n95\nTable of Contents\nversion of the draft ePrivacy Regulation. If adopted, the earliest date for entry into force is in 2023, with broad potential impacts on the use of internet-\nbased services and tracking technologies, such as cookies. Aspects of the ePrivacy Regulation remain for negotiation between the European\nCommission, the European Parliament and the Council. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy Regulation as\nit is finalized for implementation. In the UK, a well known privacy campaigning organization is driving a cookie compliance campaign. They also submitted\ncomplaints against hundreds of companies and their website ePrivacy (namely cookie) practices, and whether or not they give users the option to\nconsent to the placement of certain cookies or not. This campaign means that there is a higher risk of enforcement action. More generally, new laws,\nregulations, or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing\nbusiness and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nWhile we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the GDPR, the DPA 2018, and the U.K. GDPR, on us and despite our ongoing efforts to bring\npractices into compliance, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control, such as limited financial or human resources, or\nother factors outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR or other data\nprotection laws, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states or between the United Kingdom and one or more countries in the\nEuropean Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or otherwise. Any failure or perceived failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures, or\nmeasures relating to privacy, data protection, data security, marketing, or customer communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies,\nlegal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy, data protection, or data security, may result in\ngovernmental investigations and other proceedings, and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, as well as claims,\ncomplaints, and litigation and other proceedings from private actors, and resulting damages and other liabilities, and could cause our customers lose trust\nin us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nThis complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection, and information security creates significant compliance issues for us and\nour customers and potentially exposes us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. While we have implemented measures in an effort to\ncomply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, some PHI and other PII or confidential information is\ntransmitted to us by third parties, who may not implement adequate security and privacy measures, and it is possible that laws, rules and regulations\nrelating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices or those of\nthird parties who transmit PHI and other PII or confidential information to us. If we or these third parties are accused of having violated such laws, rules\nor regulations, it could result in claims, proceedings, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, damages, liabilities, and government-imposed\nfines, penalties (including audits and enforcement actions to stop data processing activities), orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or\ntheir practices, or criminal charges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to\nincur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing,\nconsumer communications and data security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such\nfuture laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed\ninterpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new services and maintain and grow our customer base and\nincrease revenue.\nAny disruption of service at our third-party data and call centers or Amazon Web Services could interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our services\nto our customers.\nWe currently host our platform, serve our customers primarily using Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), a provider of cloud infrastructure services.\nWe do not have control over the operations of the facilities of our data\n96\nTable of Contents\nand call center providers or AWS. Also, there are limited auditing rights for us to exercise against such data processors under Article 28. As such, there is\na greater risk of not being able to confirm compliance and meet other contractual obligations, such as obligations to customers that we have sufficient\ncontrols in place with third party suppliers. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber\nsecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism,\na decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our solution. The\nfacilities also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. Our solutions\u2019 continuing\nand uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Because our solutions and services are used by our members for health purposes, it is critical\nthat our solutions be accessible without interruption or degradation of performance. Members may become dissatisfied by any system failure that\ninterrupts our ability to provide our solutions to them. Outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to\nour customers, in which case, we may not be fully indemnified for such losses pursuant to our agreement with AWS. We may not be able to easily switch\nour AWS operations to another cloud provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS. Sustained or repeated system failures would\nreduce the attractiveness of our solution to customers and members and result in contract terminations, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative\npublicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our solution. We may not carry sufficient\nbusiness interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.\nNeither our third-party data and call center providers nor AWS have an obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable\nterms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these providers on commercially reasonable terms, if our agreements with our providers are\nprematurely terminated, or if in the future we add additional data or call center providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the\ntransfer to, or the addition of, new providers. If these providers were to increase the cost of their services, we may have to increase the price of our\nsolutions, and our operating results may be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software and other third parties for providing services\nto our customers and members, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could expose us to litigation and\nnegatively impact our relationships with customers and members, adversely affecting our operating results.\nOur ability to deliver our digital services depends on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. This\nincludes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity and security. Our services are\ndesigned to operate without interruption. However, we may experience future interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. In the\nevent of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of our systems, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could\nnegatively impact our relationship with customers and members. Outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of\ncredits to our customers, in which case, we may not be fully indemnified for such losses pursuant to our agreement with our service providers. In\naddition, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solution to customers and members and result in contract\nterminations, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may\nadversely impact use of our solution. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, natural disasters and other force majeure events outside our control\u037e\n\u2022\ncommunications failures\u037e\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures, and crashes\u037e\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches and incidents, computer viruses, hacking, denial-of-service and ransomware attacks, and similar disruptive problems\u037e and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\n97\nTable of Contents\nWe also rely on software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services. These licenses are generally commercially available on varying\nterms. However, it is possible that this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use\nany of this software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is\nidentified, obtained and integrated. Furthermore, our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements\nwith third parties, and integration of our software with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our\ntime and resources.\nAlso, any interruption in the services provided by our third-party service providers, undetected errors or defects in third-party software could\nprevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software, delay new updates or enhancements to our solution, result in a failure of our solution,\nand injure our reputation. For example, we rely on third-party billing provider software to transmit the actual claims to payers based on the specific payer\nbilling format. If this provider experiences an interruption in service or makes changes to its invoicing system, we may experience delays in claims\nprocessing. If we are required to switch to a different software provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process\nthese claims and receipt of payments from payers, or possibly denial of claims for lack of timely submission, which would have an adverse effect on our\nrevenue and our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers, including third party providers of data services\nor cloud infrastructure services, have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats, and we cannot guarantee that our systems\nand networks or those of our third-party service providers have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could\nresult in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our services. While we\nmaintain measures designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and security of our data and other data we maintain or otherwise process, our security\nmeasures or those of our third-party service providers could fail and result in unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or\ndestruction of such data.\nNeither our service providers nor our licensors have an obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If\nwe are unable to renew our agreements with such parties on commercially reasonable terms or if our agreements with our providers are prematurely\nterminated, or if in the future we add additional service providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition\nof, new providers. If these providers were to increase the cost of their services, we may have to increase the price of our solutions, and our operating\nresults may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Operating as a Public Company\nThe trading price of our Babylon Class A Shares could be volatile, and the value of our Babylon Class A Shares may decline.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our Babylon Class A Shares will trade. The price of our Babylon Class A Shares may not bear any\nrelationship to the market price at which our Babylon Class A Shares will trade after the Transactions or to any other established criteria of the value of\nour business and prospects, and the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares following the Transactions may fluctuate substantially and may be lower\nthan the price agreed by Alkuri with Babylon in connection with the Transactions. In addition, the trading price of our Babylon Class A Shares following\nthe Transactions is likely to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These\nfluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Babylon Class A Shares as you might be unable to sell your shares at or above\nthe price you paid in the Transactions. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Babylon Class A Shares include the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time\u037e\n98\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology and healthcare company stocks\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in\nparticular\u037e\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our Babylon Class A Shares by us or our shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or\nour failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections\u037e\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or contracts\u037e\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in how customers perceive the benefits of our products and services, and future product offerings\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems\u037e\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry\u037e\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations\u037e\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses, or the competitive landscape generally\u037e\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors\u037e\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights\u037e\n\u2022\nany significant data breach involving our products, services or site or data stored by us or on our behalf\u037e\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, commercial relationships, products, services, or technologies by us or our\ncompetitors\u037e\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles\u037e\n\u2022\nany adverse consequences related to our dual-class capital structure, such as stock index providers excluding companies with dual-class\ncapital structures from certain indices\u037e\n\u2022\nany significant change in our management\u037e and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our\nBabylon Class A Shares could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The trading price of our Babylon\nClass A Shares might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the\npast, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that\ncompany. If our share price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n99\nTable of Contents\nA market for our securities may not develop or be sustained, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our Babylon Class A Shares.\nFollowing the Closing, the price of our Babylon Class A Shares may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Business\nCombination and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities following the Business Combination may never\ndevelop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities after the Business Combination can vary due to general economic\nconditions and forecasts, Babylon\u2019s general business condition and the release of Babylon\u2019s financial reports. Additionally, if our securities become\ndelisted from the NYSE and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national\nsecurities exchange) or Babylon\u2019s securities are not listed on the NYSE and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the liquidity and price of our securities\nmay be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the NYSE or another national securities exchange. The lack of an\nactive market may impair your ability to sell your Babylon securities at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An\ninactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling securities and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies\nusing our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nBecause Babylon will become a public reporting company by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, the shareholders of\nBabylon may face additional risks and uncertainties.\nBecause Babylon will become a public reporting company by means of consummating the Business Combination rather than by means of a\ntraditional underwritten initial public offering, there is no independent third-party underwriter selling the shares of Babylon\u2019s common stock, and,\naccordingly, the shareholders of Babylon will not have the benefit of an independent review and investigation of the type normally performed by an\nunaffiliated, independent underwriter in a public securities offering. Due diligence reviews typically include an independent investigation of the\nbackground of the company, any advisors and their respective affiliates, review of the offering documents and independent analysis of the plan of\nbusiness and any underlying financial assumptions. Because there is no independent third-party underwriter selling Babylon\u2019s ordinary shares, Alkuri\nStockholders must rely on the information included in this proxy statement/prospectus. Although Alkuri\u2019s management conducted a due diligence review\nand investigation of Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination, the lack of an independent due diligence review and investigation\nincreases the risk of investment in Babylon because it may not have uncovered facts that would be important to a potential investor.\nMoreover, the shareholders of Babylon will not benefit from possible recourse against an underwriter for material misstatements or omissions in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus or additional roles of the underwriters in a traditional underwritten initial public offering, such as the book-building\nprocess, which helps inform efficient price discovery, and underwriter support to help stabilize the public price of the new issue immediately after listing.\nThe lack of such recourse process and support in connection with Babylon\u2019s ordinary shares could result in greater potential for errors, diminished\ninvestor demand, inefficiencies in pricing and a more volatile public price for the shares during the period immediately following the listing.\nIn addition, because Babylon will not become a public reporting company by means of a traditional underwritten initial public offering, security or\nindustry analysts may not provide, or be less likely to provide, coverage of Babylon. Investment banks may also be less likely to agree to underwrite\nsecondary offerings on behalf of Babylon than they might if Babylon became a public reporting company by means of a traditional underwritten initial\npublic offering, because they may be less familiar with Babylon as a result of more limited coverage by analysts and the media. The failure to receive\nresearch coverage or support in the market for Babylon\u2019s ordinary shares could have an adverse effect on Babylon\u2019s ability to develop a liquid market for\nBabylon\u2019s ordinary shares.\n100\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts publish reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community or publish negative research reports\nabout our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Babylon Class A Shares depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\npublish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts or the information contained in their reports. If one or more analysts\npublish research reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, or have a negative tone regarding our business, financial condition\nor results of operations, industry or end-markets, our share price could decline. In addition, if a majority of these analysts cease coverage of our company\nor fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThe dual class structure of our ordinary shares has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Founder, which will limit your ability to\ninfluence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur Babylon Class B Shares have fifteen (15) votes per share, and our Babylon Class A Shares have one (1) vote per share. Upon the Closing, the\nFounder will hold all of the issued and outstanding Babylon Class B Shares, including the Stockholder Earnout Shares. Accordingly, assuming no\nredemptions by Alkuri Stockholders with respect to their shares of Alkuri Common Stock, Dr. Parsadoust will hold 81.7% of the voting power (taking\naccount of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares following Closing. Therefore, our Founder will be able to\nsignificantly influence and pass without other shareholder support matters submitted to Babylon shareholders for approval, including the election and\nremoval of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, issuance of new shares, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all\nof our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Founder may in certain circumstances have sufficient voting control over Babylon to amend\nBabylon\u2019s governance documents and the powers, preferences or other rights attached to Babylon Class A Shares. Further, even if the Founder\nterminates his employment or is terminated for cause, he will retain voting control of Babylon following his separation and continue to have the rights\ndescribed in this paragraph based on his ownership of Babylon. Our Founder may have interests that differ from yours and may vote or take corporate\naction in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,\npreventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Babylon\nClass A Shares as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares.\nFuture transfers by our Founder of Babylon Class B Shares will generally result in those shares converting into Babylon Class A Shares, subject to\nlimited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. For information about our dual class structure, see the\nsection titled \u201cDescription of Babylon\u2019s Share Capital and Articles of Association.\u201d\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the trading market for our Babylon Class A Shares.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Babylon Class A Shares or in adverse\npublicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class\nshare structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public\ncompanies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P\nMidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened\npublic consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices\u037e\nhowever, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities \u201cwith unequal voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new\nindex that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria.\nUnder the announced policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt\n101\nTable of Contents\nto passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will\nhave on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to\nthose of other similar companies that are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we\ncannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to\ntrack certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Babylon Class A Shares\nless attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares could be adversely affected.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and our election to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our\nordinary shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we may remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i)\nthe last day of the fiscal year (A) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Alkuri IPO, (B) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at\nleast $1.07 billion, or (C) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our outstanding ordinary shares that are\nheld by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nduring the prior three year period.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that\nare applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the independent auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic\nreports and proxy statements, being required to provide fewer years of audited financial statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a\nnon-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may\nchoose to take advantage of some, but not all, of these reduced reporting burdens. Accordingly, the information we provide to our shareholders may be\ndifferent than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.\nBabylon will be a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d and, as a result, we will be permitted to rely on exemptions from certain stock exchange corporate\ngovernance standards applicable to U.S. issuers. This may afford less protection to holders of Babylon Class A Shares.\nUpon the Closing, as a foreign private issuer whose ordinary shares are listed on the NYSE, we will be permitted to follow certain home country\ncorporate governance practices in lieu of requirements under U.S. securities laws that apply to U.S. domestic public companies, including\n\u2022\nthe rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K\u037e\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under\nthe Exchange Act\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for\ninsiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time.\nWe will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our\nresults on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the NYSE rules. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will\nalso be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely\ncompared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that\nwould be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n102\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, as a foreign private issuer we will be exempt from the provisions of Regulation Fair Disclosure (\u201cRegulation FD\u201d), which prohibits\nissuers from making selective disclosure of material nonpublic information. Even though we intend to comply voluntarily with Regulation FD, these\nexemptions and leniencies will reduce the frequency and scope of information and protections to which our shareholders are entitled as investors.\nFurthermore, Babylon Shares are not listed and we do not currently intend to list Babylon Shares on any market in the Bailiwick of Jersey, our\ncountry of incorporation. As a result, we are not subject to the reporting and other requirements of companies listed in the Bailiwick of Jersey.\nWe are a \u201cforeign private issuer.\u201d As such, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain stock exchange corporate governance standards. As\na result, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than shareholders of companies that are subject to all Exchange Act and the NYSE\ncorporate governance requirements.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we have the option to follow certain home country corporate governance practices rather than those of the NYSE,\nprovided that we disclose the requirements we are not following and describe the home country practices we are following. Currently, we intend to follow\ncertain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required under the NYSE rules for U.S. issuers, as further disclosed in\n\u201cManagement Following the Business Combination\u2014Foreign Private Issuer.\u201d\nAny foreign private issuer exemptions we avail ourselves of in the future may reduce the scope of information and protection to which you are\notherwise entitled as an investor. As result, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject\nto all the NYSE corporate governance requirements. For more information, see \u201cManagement Following the Business Combination\u2014Foreign Private\nIssuer.\u201d\nWe may lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional cost and expense.\nIn order to maintain our current status as a foreign private issuer, either (a) more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities must be either\ndirectly or indirectly owned of record by non-residents of the United States or (b)(i) a majority of our executive officers or directors may not be U.S.\ncitizens or residents, (ii) more than 50% of our assets cannot be located in the United States and (iii) our business must be administered principally\noutside the United States. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts with\nthe United States. If we lose our foreign private issuer status, we will be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S.\ndomestic issuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. We would also have to mandatorily\ncomply with U.S. federal proxy requirements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit\ndisclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we may also be required to make changes in our corporate governance\npractices in accordance with various SEC and the NYSE rules. The additional requirements that we would become subject to if we were to lose our foreign\nprivate issuer status could lead us to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption, we will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE\nrules, and we will qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nBecause the Founder will, collectively, own at least a majority of our voting rights following the Closing, we will be considered a \u201ccontrolled\ncompany\u201d as that term is set forth in the NYSE rules. Under these rules, a\n103\nTable of Contents\ncompany of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may\nelect not to comply with certain stock exchange rules regarding corporate governance, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors\u037e\n\u2022\nthe requirement that its nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the\ncommittee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nThese requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Although we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we do not\nexpect to rely on this exemption and intend to comply with relevant corporate governance requirements under the NYSE. However, if we were to utilize\nsome or all of these exemptions, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the stock\nexchange rules regarding corporate governance.\nOur issuance of additional Babylon Class A Shares in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise\nwill dilute all other shareholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other shareholders. We expect to grant equity awards to\nemployees, directors, and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our\nbusiness strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any\nsuch acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause shareholders to experience significant dilution of their\nownership interests and the per share value of our Babylon Class A Shares to decline.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to\ncompliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, which we expect to\nfurther increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public\ncompanies. Our management and other personnel are not experienced in managing a public company and will be required to devote a substantial amount\nof time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make\nsome activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the\nspecific timing of such costs.\nSome of our management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nMembers of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and\ncomplying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage us as a\npublic company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny\nof securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert\ntheir attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n104\nTable of Contents\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses is not\neffective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to\nproduce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year that coincides with the filing of our second annual report on\nForm 20-F. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial\nreporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting in our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nIn connection with the audits of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we identified certain control deficiencies\nin the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses specifically resulted from (i) lack of documented\nevidence for management review controls related to areas of significant judgment and estimation uncertainty and non-routine transactions and (ii)\ninsufficient segregation of duties and management oversight. We are in the process of designing and implementing measures to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses related to our financial reporting as of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nThis includes implementing timelier review procedures within our accounting and finance department and hiring additional accounting resources.\nSpecifically, we have identified that we lack timely, documented evidence of management review controls related to areas of significant judgment\nand estimation uncertainty and non-routine transactions and that we have insufficient segregation of duties and evidence of management oversight to\nsupport the implementation and execution of some of our controls.\nWe are in the process of designing and implementing measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material\nweaknesses related to its financial reporting as of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. This includes implementing additional, timelier, review\nprocedures within our accounting and finance department and hiring additional accounting resources. At the time of this proxy statement/prospectus,\nthese material weaknesses have not been remediated.\nWhile we are designing and implementing measures to remediate the material weaknesses, we cannot predict the success of such measures or the\noutcome of our assessment of these measures at this time. We can give no assurance that these measures will remediate either of the deficiencies in\ninternal control or that additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to\nimplement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that may lead to a restatement\nof our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If a material weakness was identified and we are unable to assert that its\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to\nexpress an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and\ncompleteness of our financial reports, the market price of our Ordinary Shares could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or\ninvestigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\n105\nTable of Contents\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and our key metrics require management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and amounts reported in our key metrics. We base our\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section\ntitled \u201cBabylon\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The results of these estimates form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to\nallowance for doubtful accounts, assessment of the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, fair value of guarantees included in revenue\narrangements, fair values of stock-based awards, warrants, contingent consideration, and income taxes. Our results of operations may be adversely\naffected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of Babylon Shares.\nU.S. holders that directly or indirectly own 10% or more of our equity interests may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences under\nrules applicable to U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations.\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a \u201cCFC\u201d), if \u201c10% U.S.\nequityholders\u201d (as defined below) own, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 50% of either (i) the total combined voting power of all classes of\nstock of such corporation entitled to vote or (ii) the total value of the stock of such corporation. We do not believe that Babylon Holdings would be\nclassified as a CFC at the time of Closing, although CFC status is determined after taking into account complex constructive ownership rules and,\naccordingly, there can be no assurance in this regard. However, certain of Babylon Holdings\u2019 non-U.S. subsidiaries may be classified as CFCs (as a result\nof the application of certain constructive ownership rules which treat Babylon Holdings\u2019 U.S. subsidiaries as owning the equity of those non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries), and it is possible that we may be classified as a CFC in the future. The U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. holders who at all\ntimes are not 10% U.S. equityholders would not be affected by the CFC rules. However, a U.S. holder that owns (or is treated as owning, directly,\nindirectly or constructively, including by applying certain attribution rules) 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled\nto vote or the total value of our equity interests (including equity interests attributable to a deemed exercise of options and convertible debt instruments),\nor a \u201c10% U.S. equityholder\u201d, if we were classified as a CFC, would generally be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation on a portion of our\napplicable subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and our earnings and profits, regardless of whether\nsuch 10% U.S. equityholder receives any actual distributions. In addition, if we were classified as a CFC, a portion of any gains realized on the sale of our\ncommon shares by a 10% U.S. equityholder may be treated as ordinary income. A 10% U.S. equityholder will also be subject to additional U.S. federal\nincome tax information reporting requirements with respect to our subsidiaries that are classified as CFCs and with respect to us (if we were classified as a\nCFC) and substantial penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. We cannot provide any assurances that Babylon will assist U.S. Holders in\ndetermining whether Babylon or any of its subsidiaries are treated as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or whether any\nU.S. Holder is treated as a 10% U.S. equityholder with respect to any of such controlled foreign corporations or furnish to any holder information that\nmay be necessary to comply with reporting and tax paying obligations if Babylon, or any of its subsidiaries, is treated as a controlled foreign corporation\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the CFC rules and whether such U.S. holder may be a\n10% U.S. equityholder for purposes of these rules.\nOur U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are classified as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company.\u201d\n106\nTable of Contents\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be treated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d (\u201cPFIC\u201d), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any\ntaxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally based on\nan average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.\nBased on the current and anticipated composition of the income, assets and operations of Babylon and its subsidiaries and certain factual assumptions,\nBabylon does not expect to be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year ending December 31, 2021. However, there can be no assurances in this regard,\nbecause PFIC status is determined annually and requires a factual determination that depends on, among other things, the composition of a company\u2019s\nincome, assets and activities in each taxable year, and can only be made annually after the close of each taxable year, and is thus subject to significant\nuncertainty. Furthermore, because the value of our gross assets is likely to be determined in part by reference to our market capitalization, a decline in the\nvalue of our ordinary shares may result in Babylon becoming a PFIC. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for\nany taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d)\nholds our ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder. Prospective U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to them. See \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014Tax\nConsequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants\u2014Passive Foreign Investment Company\nRules.\u201d\nThe Internal Revenue Service may not agree that Babylon should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAlthough Babylon is incorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may assert that it should be treated as a U.S.\ncorporation (and therefore a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, a corporation is generally considered a U.S. \u201cdomestic\u201d corporation (or U.S. tax resident) if it is organized in the United States, and a\ncorporation is generally considered a \u201cforeign\u201d corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) if it is not a U.S. corporation. Because Babylon is an entity\nincorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874\nof the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated and foreign tax resident entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S.\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAs more fully described in the section titled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon\n\u2014Tax Residence of Babylon for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes,\u201d based on the terms of the Business Combination and certain factual assumptions,\nBabylon is not currently expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code after the\nBusiness Combination. However, the application of Section 7874 of the Code is complex and is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is\nuncertain in various respects and would be impacted by changes in such U.S. Treasury regulations with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to\ncertain factual uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of Babylon as a foreign corporation under\nSection 7874 of the Code or that such challenge would not be sustained by a court.\nIf the IRS were to successfully challenge under Section 7874 of the Code Babylon\u2019s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, Babylon and certain Babylon shareholders would be subject to significant adverse tax consequences, including a higher effective corporate\nincome tax rate on Babylon and future withholding taxes on certain Babylon shareholders, depending on the application of any income tax treaty that\nmight apply to reduce such withholding taxes.\nSee \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon\u2014Tax Residence of Babylon for U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Purposes\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination. Investors in\nBabylon should consult their own advisors regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination.\n107\nTable of Contents\nSection 7874 of the Code may limit the ability of Alkuri to use certain tax attributes following the Business Combination, increase Babylon\u2019s U.S.\naffiliates\u2019 U.S. taxable income or have other adverse consequences to Babylon and Babylon\u2019s shareholders.\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S.\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S.\ncorporation and its U.S. affiliates to use U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. taxable income resulting\nfrom certain transactions, as well as result in certain other adverse tax consequences, even if the acquiring foreign corporation is respected as a\nforeign corporation for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. In general, if a foreign corporation acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the\nproperties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation and after the acquisition, the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least\n60% (by either vote or value) but less than 80% (by vote and value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the\nacquired U.S. corporation, subject to other requirements, certain adverse tax consequences under Section 7874 of the Code may apply.\nIf these rules apply to the Business Combination, Babylon and certain of Babylon\u2019s shareholders may be subject to adverse tax consequences\nincluding, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of tax attributes with respect to \u201cinversion gain\u201d recognized over a 10-year period following the\ntransaction, disqualification of dividends paid from preferential \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d rates and the requirement that any U.S. corporation owned\nby Babylon include as \u201cbase erosion payments\u201d that may be subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax any amounts treated as reductions in gross\nincome paid to certain related foreign persons. Furthermore, certain \u201cdisqualified individuals\u201d (including officers and directors of a U.S. corporation) may\nbe subject to an excise tax on certain stock-based compensation held thereby at a rate of 20%.\nAs more fully described in the section titled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon\n\u2014Utilization of Alkuri\u2019s Tax Attributes and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to Babylon and Babylon\u2019s Shareholders,\u201d based on the terms of\nthe Business Combination and certain factual assumptions, Babylon is not currently expected to be subject to these rules under Section 7874 of the Code\nafter the Business Combination.\nHowever, even if Babylon is not subject to the above adverse consequences under Section 7874, Babylon may be limited in using its equity to\nengage in future acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period following the Business Combination. If Babylon were to be treated as acquiring\nsubstantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation or U.S. partnership within a 36-month period after the Business Combination, the Section 7874\nRegulations would exclude certain shares of Babylon attributable to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the Section 7874 Percentage\nof that subsequent acquisition, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code will apply to such subsequent acquisition.\nSee \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Babylon\u2014Utilization of Alkuri\u2019s Tax Attributes\nand Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to Babylon and Babylon\u2019s Shareholders\u201d for a more detailed discussion of the application of Section 7874\nof the Code to the Business Combination. Investors in Babylon should consult their own advisors regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code\nto the Business Combination.\nRisks Related to Our Incorporation in Jersey\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder will be governed by Jersey law, which differs in some material respects with respect to the rights and\nresponsibilities of shareholders of U.S. companies.\nBabylon is organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast\nof Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member of the European Union. Jersey legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law\nprinciples. The rights and responsibilities of the holders of our ordinary shares will be governed by the Babylon Articles and by Jersey\n108\nTable of Contents\nlaw, including the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some material respects from the rights and\nresponsibilities of shareholders in U.S. corporations.\nIn particular, Jersey law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of companies may bring derivative actions and, in most\ncases, only the corporation may be the proper claimant or plaintiff for the purposes of maintaining proceedings in respect of any wrongful act committed\nagainst it. Neither an individual nor any group of shareholders has any right of action in such circumstances. Jersey law also does not afford appraisal\nrights to dissenting shareholders in the form typically available to shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\nSee \u201cComparison of Rights of Babylon Shareholders and Alkuri Stockholders\u201d in this proxy statement/prospectus for a description of the\nprincipal differences between the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law applicable to us and the DGCL relating to shareholders\u2019 rights and protections.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that Jersey law will not change in the future or that it will serve to protect the investors in a similar fashion afforded\nunder corporate law principles in the United States, which could adversely affect the rights of investors.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us or our directors and officers outside the United States, or to assert U.S. securities law claims\noutside of the United States.\nA number of our directors and executive officers are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these\npersons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to effect service of process upon us within the\nUnited States or other jurisdictions, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.\nInvestors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the United States, including Jersey, for\nliabilities under the securities laws of the United States. The Babylon Articles will provide that, unless Babylon consents in writing to the selection of an\nalternative forum, the Courts of Jersey shall (to the fullest extent permitted by law) be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions,\nactions for breach of fiduciary duty by Babylon directors and officers, actions arising out of Jersey Companies Law or actions arising out of or in\nconnection with the Babylon Articles (pursuant to any provisions of Jersey law) or otherwise relating to the constitution or conduct of the company\nitself (other than any such action of the company that may arise out of a breach of any federal law of the United States or the laws of any U.S. state). The\nexclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in\na U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims. In addition, unless the company consents in writing to the\nselection of an alternative forum, U.S federal district courts shall be the sole and exclusive form for any resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of\naction arising under the Securities Act.\nAlthough we believe these exclusive forum provisions will benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the laws of Jersey in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, these provisions may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a\njudicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, shareholders, officers, or others, or may increase the cost of doing so, both of\nwhich may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provision. Further, in the event a court finds the exclusive\nforum provisions contained in the Babylon Articles to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\n109\nTable of Contents",

Holders of Alkuri public shares will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if they\ndeliver their shares to Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the special meeting. Holders of Alkuri public shares do not need\nto affirmatively vote on the Business Combination Proposal or be a holder of such Alkuri public shares as of the record date to exercise redemption\nrights. If the Business Combination is not consummated, these shares will not be redeemed for cash. If a holder of Alkuri public shares properly demands\nsuch redemption, delivers his, her or its shares to Alkuri\u2019s transfer agent as described above, and the Business Combination is consummated, Alkuri will\nredeem each Alkuri public share into a full pro rata portion of the trust account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the date of the special\nmeeting. It is anticipated that this would amount to approximately $10.00 per share. If a holder of Alkuri public shares exercises his, her or its conversion\nrights, then it will be redeeming its shares of Alkuri Common Stock for cash and will not become a shareholder of Babylon.\nAlkuri\u2019s Sponsor, officers and directors do not have redemption rights with respect to any Babylon Class A Shares owned by them, directly or\nindirectly.\nAlkuri requires public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to\nAlkuri\u2019s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the vote on the Business Combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent\nelectronically using Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option. There is a nominal cost\nassociated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will\ntypically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder.\nAny request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination. Furthermore,\nif a holder of an Alkuri public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote\non the Business Combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or\nelectronically).\nIf the Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then Alkuri Stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights\nwould not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, Alkuri will promptly return any shares\ndelivered by public holders.\n115\nTable of Contents\nAppraisal Rights\nAlkuri Stockholders and holders of Alkuri Warrants do not have appraisal rights in connection with the Transactions under the DGCL.\nProxy Solicitation Costs\nProxies may be solicited by mail, telephone or in person. Alkuri has engaged Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies, and it will\npay such firm $37,500 plus disbursements for such services.\nOther Matters\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Alkuri board of directors does not know of any business to be presented at the special\nmeeting other than as set forth in the notice accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus. If any other matters should properly come before the special\nmeeting, it is intended that the shares represented by proxies will be voted with respect to such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons\nvoting the proxies.\nInterests of Alkuri\u2019s Officers and Directors in the Transactions\nIn considering the recommendation of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors to vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri\nStockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in such proposal that are different from, or\nin addition to, those of Alkuri Stockholders generally. In particular:\n\u2022\nIf the Business Combination with Babylon Holdings or another business combination is not consummated by February 9, 2023 (or such\nlater date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders), Alkuri will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming\n100% of the outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining stockholders and its board of\ndirectors, dissolving and liquidating. In such event, the Alkuri Securities held by the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s directors and officers, which\nwere acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the Alkuri IPO, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to\nparticipate in any redemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $85,646,250 based\nupon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated,\neach outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants from Alkuri for $1.50 per private. This purchase took place on a private\nplacement basis simultaneously with the consummation of the Alkuri IPO. All of the proceeds Alkuri received from these purchases were\nplaced in the trust account. Such private placement warrants had an aggregate market value of $8,484,666 based upon the closing price of\n$1.43 per warrant on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants had an\naggregate market value of $58,917,997 based upon the closing price of $9.93 per share on Nasdaq on September 7, 2021. The private\nplacement warrants and the Alkuri Class A Common Stock underlying the private placement warrants will become worthless if Alkuri does\nnot consummate a business combination by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an\namendment to the SPAC Charter). On the other hand, if the Business Combination is consummated, each outstanding whole warrant will\nbecome a Babylon warrant exercisable to purchase one Babylon Class A Share following consummation of the Business Combination and\neach outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock will be converted into Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nIf Alkuri is unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor will be personally liable under certain\ncircumstances described herein to ensure that the proceeds in the\n116\nTable of Contents\ntrust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for\nservices rendered or contracted for or products sold to Alkuri. If Alkuri consummates a business combination, on the other hand, Alkuri will\nbe liable for all such claims.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them\nin connection with certain activities on Alkuri\u2019s behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and business\ncombinations. However, if Alkuri fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, they will not have any claim\nagainst the trust account for reimbursement. Accordingly, Alkuri may not be able to reimburse these expenses if the Business Combination\nor another business combination is not completed by February 9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an\namendment to the SPAC Charter). As of the record date, the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and their affiliates had incurred\napproximately $4,099,486 of unpaid reimbursable expenses.\n\u2022\nThe Sponsor, the chairman of the board of directors of Alkuri, and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have agreed\nto purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the\nother PIPE Investors.\n\u2022\nUntil the first anniversary of Closing, an affiliated entity of the Sponsor and Alkuri\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will\nhave the right to appoint or nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Babylon.\n\u2022\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the continued indemnification of Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers and the continuation of\ndirectors and officers liability insurance covering Alkuri\u2019s current directors and officers.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s officers and directors (or their affiliates) may make loans from time to time to Alkuri to fund certain capital requirements. As of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, no such loans have been made, but loans may be made after the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the loans will not be repaid and will be forgiven except to the\nextent there are funds available to Alkuri outside of the trust account.\nInterests of Babylon Holdings\u2019 Directors and Officers in the Business Combination\nIn considering the recommendation of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors in favor of the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, stockholders\nshould keep in mind that Babylon\u2019s directors and officers may have interests in such proposal that are different from, or in addition to, those of Alkuri\nStockholders and warrant holders generally. These interests include, among other things, the interests listed below:\n\u2022\nEntities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings\u2019 Chief Executive Officer and chairman of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors,\nhave agreed to purchase 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and\nconditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth, member of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder\nof greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 share capital, and (ii) Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon\u2019s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a\nholder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 share capital, have each agreed to purchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to\nSubscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.\n\u2022\nCertain of Babylon Holdings\u2019 directors and executive officers will serve as officers of Babylon following the consummation of the Business\nCombination. As such, in the future they will receive any cash or equity-based compensation that the Babylon board determines to pay to\nsuch officers. For additional information, see the section entitled \u201cManagement Following the Business Combination.\u201d\n\u2022\nDr. Ali Parsadoust will receive the Stockholder Earnout Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. For additional information, see the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Earnout.\u201d\n117\nTable of Contents\nPurchases of Alkuri Shares\nAt any time prior to the special meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding Alkuri or its\nsecurities, the Sponsor, Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares from institutional and other investors who\nvote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, or execute agreements to purchase shares from such investors in the\nfuture, or they may enter into transactions with such investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire shares of Alkuri Common Stock or\nvote their shares in favor of the Merger Agreement. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions may be to increase the likelihood of\nsatisfaction of the requirements to consummate the Business Combination where it appears that such requirements would otherwise not be met.\nWhile the exact nature of any such arrangements has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, they might include,\nwithout limitation, arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put options\nand, with Babylon\u2019s consent, the transfer to such investors or holders of shares or warrants owned by the Sponsor for nominal value.\nEntering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on Alkuri Common Stock. For example, as a result of these arrangements, an\ninvestor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to sell the shares he\nowns, either prior to or immediately after the special meeting.\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combination to be approved in circumstances where such\napproval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the\napproval of the Business Combination Proposal and other proposals and would likely increase the chances that such proposals would be approved. No\nagreements dealing with the above arrangements or purchases have been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus.\n118\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "PROPOSAL ONE\u2014THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL\nThe following is a discussion of the proposed Business Combination and the Merger Agreement. This is a summary only and may not contain all\nof the information that is important to you. This summary is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Merger Agreement, a copy of\nwhich is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. Alkuri Stockholders are urged to read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully,\nincluding the Merger Agreement, for a more complete understanding of the Business Combination.\nGeneral\nTransaction Structure\nThe Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Alkuri with and into Merger Sub, with Alkuri surviving the Business Combination as a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Babylon.\nPro Forma Capitalization\nThe pro forma equity valuation of Babylon upon consummation of the Transactions is estimated to approximate $4.2 billion. We estimate that at the\nEffective Time without giving effect to the issuance of Earnout Shares and assuming none of Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders demand of their Alkuri public\nshares pursuant to the SPAC Charter, the securityholders of Babylon and Babylon\u2019s management will own more than 75% of the outstanding Babylon\nShares and the securityholders of Alkuri, the Sponsor, the Founder, and certain accredited investors purchasing PIPE Shares will own the remaining\nBabylon Shares. At Closing, the Founder will own all outstanding shares of Babylon Class B Shares.\nMerger Consideration\nThe Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion. Prior to the\nClosing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of Babylon Holdings will be reclassified into Babylon Class A Shares,\nother than the Babylon\n119Table of Contents\nHoldings Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of the Reclassification, each outstanding Babylon Class A\nShare and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the $3.515 billion equity value of Babylon\nHoldings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder. The Babylon Class B Shares will have the same economic terms as the\nBabylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Babylon Class A Share will have one vote per share).\nOwnership of Babylon after the Business Combination\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon\nShares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power\nof Babylon\u037e (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and\n0.6% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and\n95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon being held by the\nFounder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately\nfollowing the Business Combination\u037e (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata\nportion of the funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being\npurchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE\nInvestment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no\nredemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions.\nBackground of the Business Combination\nThe terms of the Business Combination are the result of negotiations between the representatives of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings. The following\nis a brief description of the background of these negotiations and the resulting Business Combination.\nAlkuri is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 1, 2020 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock\nexchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Alkuri\u2019s intention was to\ncapitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of its management team and advisors in order to identify and combine with\none or more businesses in the disruptive technology sector broadly with a spotlight on Consumer Internet and Marketplaces, Healthtech, Fintech and\nMobility.\nOn February 9, 2021, Alkuri consummated its initial public offering (taken together with the underwriter\u2019s full exercise of the over-allotment option)\nof 34,500,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one warrant, generating total gross\nproceeds of $345,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of\n$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s IPO and the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment\noption, Alkuri consummated the private sale of 5,933,333 private placement warrants to Sponsor, each of which entitles the holder to purchase one share\nof Alkuri Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of approximately\n$8,900,000.\nPrior to the consummation of the Alkuri IPO, neither Alkuri, nor anyone on its behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or\nindirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with Alkuri.\n120\nTable of Contents\nAfter the Alkuri IPO, Alkuri\u2019s officers, advisors and directors commenced an active search for prospective businesses or assets to acquire in its\ninitial business combination. Representatives from the Alkuri management team contacted, and were contacted by, numerous individuals, financial\nadvisors and other entities who offered to present ideas for business combination opportunities. In addition, certain Alkuri advisors and directors also\nidentified potential business combination candidates for Alkuri.\nIn light of the volume of potential partners to a business combination (including Babylon Holdings, the \u201cPotential Targets\u201d) with whom Alkuri had\nan opportunity to engage in discussions, the Alkuri management team commenced standing weekly update calls with the Alkuri board of directors on\nFebruary 26, 2021.\nBetween February 2021 and April 2021, Alkuri engaged in discussions, including at least one meeting, with forty Potential Targets. The industries\nin which these Potential Targets operated included the following: Healthcare, Consumer Internet/Ecommerce, Financial Services Technology, Enterprise\nSoftware and Clean Energy Technology.\nOf these Potential Targets that Alkuri met with at least one time, Alkuri also:\n\u2022\nEntered into non-disclosure agreements with 24 such Potential Targets (including Babylon Holdings)\u037e\n\u2022\nReceived management presentations or confidential information memorandums from twenty Potential Targets (including Babylon Holdings)\u037e\n\u2022\nFielded two meetings with three Potential Targets\u037e\n\u2022\nFielded three to four meetings with an additional seven Potential Targets\u037e\n\u2022\nFielded over six meetings with an additional four Potential Targets (including Babylon Holdings)\u037e\n\u2022\nObtained access to a virtual dataroom, and conducted additional due diligence of varying degrees, with respect to eleven Potential Targets\n(including Babylon Holdings)\u037e and\n\u2022\nProvided a letter of intent with respect to a business combination to three Potential Targets (one in the Consumer Internet/Ecommerce\nsector, one in the Enterprise Software sector and Babylon Holdings).\nFollowing such reviews, and at various points in time, these discussions with Potential Targets (other than Babylon Holdings) were discontinued\nfor one or various reasons, including the maturity of the business, the lack of a near-term path to profitability, the valuation of the Potential Target, the\nstrength of the management team of the Potential Target, and the lack of competitive advantages or sufficient barriers to entries for the Potential Target.\nWith respect to one of the two Potential Targets (other than Babylon Holdings) that had progressed to the stage where Alkuri presented a letter of intent,\nalthough Babylon and the Potential Target exchanged a few drafts of the letter of intent with certain transaction terms, discussions were ultimately\ndiscontinued before a letter of intent was entered into with Babylon Holdings because of Alkuri\u2019s belief that the valuation expectations of the Potential\nTarget were too high to justify further discussion. With respect to the second Potential Target (other than Babylon Holdings) that had progressed to the\nstage where Alkuri presented a letter of intent, although Babylon and the Potential Target exchanged a few drafts of the letter of intent with certain\ntransaction terms, discussions were discontinued for the reasons described below in connection with Alkuri\u2019s decision to enter into a letter of intent with\nBabylon Holdings (the \u201cLOI\u201d).\nOn March 10, 2021, Dominic Lester and a team of European based investment bankers at Jefferies LLC (\u201cJefferies\u201d), in the course of representing\nBabylon Holdings in relation to a possible business combination, contacted Alkuri in order to determine whether Alkuri would be willing to explore a\npotential business combination with Babylon Holdings. The Jefferies team indicated their belief that Alkuri\u2019s experience in global operations, hyper-\nscaling and healthcare technology, could allow Alkuri to offer a differentiating level of expertise for Babylon Holdings while also providing Alkuri\u2019s\nstockholders with a compelling value creation\n121\nTable of Contents\nopportunity. During this meeting, Alkuri was provided background on Babylon\u2019s business, management team and competitive position.\nOn March 12, 2021, Alkuri held internal conversations (including with a Jefferies team advising Alkuri based in the United States and led by Guarav\nKittur and Jeffrey Snyder) in order to consider the prospects for a potential business combination with Babylon Holdings. Prior to such meeting, Jefferies\nhad put customary insulation wall-procedures in place to prevent the U.S. team from communicating with the team led by Mr. Lester regarding Babylon\nHoldings or otherwise accessing information regarding Babylon Holdings. Members of the Alkuri team were familiar with the Babylon Holdings brand,\nand had previously worked with select members of Babylon Holdings US-based management team in previous roles at unrelated companies, however the\nAlkuri team had not met with or engaged Babylon Holdings management or executives prior to these internal conversations.\nOn March 15, 2021, Alkuri entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Babylon Holdings and subsequently received access to the data room in\norder to facilitate Alkuri\u2019s due diligence review of Babylon Holdings. The non-disclosure agreement did not include a standstill.\nOn March 16, 2021, Alkuri held a follow-up conversation with a team of investment bankers led by Dominic Lester, during which Alkuri was\nafforded an opportunity to ask additional questions with respect to Babylon Holdings and the proposed process related to a potential business\ncombination.\nOn March 17, 2021, members of Babylon Holdings\u2019 management met with Alkuri in order to provide Alkuri with a management presentation on the\nBabylon Holdings business.\nOn March 19, 2021, Rich Williams and Dr. Ali Parsadoust, spoke directly in order to familiarize themselves with each other, their goals and the\nrespective teams at Alkuri and Babylon Holdings. In addition, the call included a high-level discussion of enterprise value to revenue multiples (\u201cEV-Rev\nmultiple\u201d) attributed to well-known and slower growth peer companies of Babylon Holdings, which Dr. Ali Parsadoust indicated ranged between 10-15x\nrevenue, with some companies trading even higher despite more limited services and capabilities than those offered by Babylon Holdings.\nIn parallel with the foregoing discussions, Alkuri directed the Jefferies U.S. team to conduct a valuation analysis based on comparable companies\nof Babylon Holdings, the first draft of which was delivered to Alkuri on March 22, 2021. This analysis consisted of the Selected Peer Companies. The\nanalysis demonstrated: (i) 2021 EV-Rev multiples ranging from 10.5x to 32.3x, with a median of 15.5x, and (ii) 2022 EV-Rev multiples ranging from 6.7x to\n22.2x, with a median of 11.1x. Viewing 2021 and 2022 data showed the Selected Peer Companies growing at a median below 40% and a 2020-2022\nCompound Annual Growth Rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) median of 39.6%, compared to Babylon Holdings\u2019 projected 3-year CAGR of approximately 200%. As a result,\nthe analysis demonstrated that the valuation ranges presented by Dr. Ali Parsadoust were well within the bounds of then current market data and\ntrending toward the lower-end of the valuation ranges. Accordingly, Alkuri believed that, subject to obtaining diligence comfort on Babylon Holdings\u2019\nability to execute on 2021 and 2022 revenue projections, a potential business combination with Babylon Holdings presented a strong potential for\noutsized returns to Alkuri Stockholders.\nBetween March 23, 2021 and March 26, 2021, Alkuri engaged in a series of diligence meetings with Babylon Holdings and its representatives in\norder to, among other things, better understand Babylon Holdings\u2019 operations, financial model, products and technology.\nIn parallel, multiple discussions were held in order to better understand Babylon Holdings\u2019 expectations on material terms in connection with any\npotential business combination. These parallel discussions included a call on March 24, 2021 between Rich Williams and Dr. Ali Parsadoust. Although\nthere was little discussion with respect to either parties\u2019 specific expectations in regard to valuation, during this call Mr. Williams articulated his\n122\nTable of Contents\nthematic focus on deal certainty and pricing an initial business combination in a manner that was fair to all parties (including, in particular, to Alkuri\nStockholders) and that would create what Alkuri Stockholders and other prospective investors would ideally see as an attractive investment opportunity\nthat held the potential to generate outsized returns and long-term value creation. Additional high-level discussion also included concepts such as post-\nclosing consideration structures (such as an earnout), post-closing governance matters, exclusivity, process and timing related to any potential business\ncombination. The representatives of Babylon Holdings also proposed to continue the super-voting rights of Dr. Parsadoust as part of the post-closing\ngovernance provisions.\nFollowing such initial business diligence and high-level discussions with respect to business expectations for any potential business combination,\non March 26, 2021, Alkuri provided Babylon Holdings with a first draft of the LOI. This first draft of the LOI ascribed a closing enterprise valuation to\nBabylon Holdings of $3.078 billion. In addition, as a result of feedback provided during the call on March 24, 2021, Alkuri included a post-closing earnout\nopportunity for Babylon\u2019s shareholders and agreed to subject a portion of the Sponsor shares to an earnout in its first draft of the LOI. The earnout\nopportunity for Babylon\u2019s shareholders contemplated additional consideration to be provided in the form of 30,776,875 additional shares that vested in\ntwo equal tier earnout tranches when Babylon Shares trade above $15 and $20, respectively for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. In the LOI, the\nSponsor also agreed to subject 15% of its existing shares to the same earnout vesting schedule Alkuri proposed these economic terms in order to, among\nother things, de-risk Babylon Holdings\u2019 performance against its projections, particularly in light of the early stage of Alkuri\u2019s diligence on Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 revenue pipeline that supported its projections. Specifically, Alkuri believed that setting closing consideration toward the low end of valuation\nranges of the Selected Peer Companies would provide an important protection to its stockholders in the event that Babylon Shares failed to trade-up in\nline with expectations (including because Babylon Holdings failed to execute in full against its projections). On the other hand, a meaningful earnout\nopportunity provided a reward to Babylon executives who participate in the long-term incentive plan to be adopted by Babylon Holdings in connection\nwith the Business Combination in an upside scenario where Babylon traded toward the higher end of the valuation range, while also creating a\nmeaningful economic incentive for these Babylon executives to perform (or over perform) against its projections.\nOn March 29, 2021, representatives from Alkuri, the Jefferies team with whom Alkuri was working, Babylon Holdings, Winston & Strawn LLP,\nAlkuri\u2019s legal counsel (\u201cWinston\u201d) and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Babylon Holdings\u2019 legal counsel (\u201cWSGR\u201d) held a video conference meeting\nto discuss high-level terms of a potential business combination between Alkuri and Babylon Holdings and a possible timeline for such business\ncombination.\nAlso, on March 29, 2021, Babylon Holdings indicated its desire for Alkuri to enter into non-disclosure agreements with select potential investors in\norder to assess the strength of interest in a potential business combination between Alkuri and Babylon Holdings, including the willingness of such\ninvestors to participate in a private placement fundraise (the \u201cPIPE Investment\u201d) in connection with such potential business combination.\nBetween March 29, 2021 and April 7, 2021, Alkuri entered into non-disclosure agreements with, and previewed the potential business combination\nfor, eight prospective investors in the PIPE Investment.\nThroughout the course of these discussions, the Alkuri management team worked with the Jefferies U.S. team to continue work on the valuation\nanalysis of Babylon Holdings. As part of this work, Alkuri and its advisors looked at the Selected Peer Companies in order to both understand a broader\nrange of potential trading outcomes and investor sentiment in related categories. This work included reviewing the Selected Peer Companies, which were\nnot viewed as being direct peers by the Alkuri management team or Jefferies. The Alkuri management team believed the group of Selected Peer companies\nconsisted of a variety of companies at divergent ends of the valuation spectrum. This broader review was conducted because Alkuri management and\nJefferies believed that reviewing and understanding a broader range of data would help them to better understand potential value ranges, the factors\ndriving divergent valuation outcomes and, as a result, focus diligence efforts on key valuation drivers. Based on this broader review, Alkuri believed that\nkey differentiators for Babylon Holdings that would need to be confirmed as part of the diligence process included the sustainability of its\n123\nTable of Contents\nhistoric growth into the future, the diversification of its business model and comparatively strong margins and/or revenue scale. Additionally, while this\nbroader review resulted in slightly lower median 2021 EV-Rev multiples of 11.1x and 2022 EV-Rev multiples of 7x, it also lowered median growth rates to\nbelow 35%. As a result, Alkuri management believed the Selected Peer Companies, confirmed that the valuation ranges under discussion with Babylon\nHoldings (as detailed below) remained a meaningful discount to median EV-Rev multiples, while increasing the growth disparity between Babylon\nHoldings and the Selected Peer Companies. Accordingly, Alkuri continued to believe that a potential business combination with Babylon Holdings\npresented the potential for outsized returns to its stockholders.\nFrom March 26, 2021 through April 7, 2021, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings also continued active negotiations with respect to the terms of the LOI.\nThe focus of the negotiations on the LOI related to, among other things, the enterprise value ascribed to Babylon Holdings, share price vesting\nthresholds for the Stockholder Earnout Shares and the post-closing governance terms of Babylon Holdings, including the super-voting rights.\nDuring the course of these negotiations and based on requests from Babylon Holdings, closing enterprise valuation was increased from $3.078\nbillion to $3.5 billion, the number of Earnout Shares to be made available to Babylon executives was increased from 30,7776,875 shares to 40,000,000\nshares (which were ultimately divided into 38,800,000 Stockholder Earnout Shares to be issued to the Founder and 1,200,000 awards to be issued to other\nBabylon executives (rather than all of the Babylon shareholders) under a long-term incentive plan to be adopted by Babylon Holdings in connection with\nthe Business Combination), additional share price vesting tiers for when the Earnout Shares trade above $12.50 and $17.50, respectively, for 20 out of 30\nconsecutive trading days, were added to the two originally proposed trading price thresholds by Alkuri (of $15 and $20) and the post-closing ratio to be\nattributed to the \u201chigh-vote\u201d shares to be received by the Founder was increased from a 10 to 1 ratio to a 15 to 1 ratio because such \u201chigh-vote\u201d shares\nwould only be received in respect of the existing Babylon Holdings Class A ordinary shares (which are \u201chigh-vote\u201d shares) which represents some, but\nnot all, of the shares of Babylon Holdings held by the Founder.\nThe increase in the closing enterprise valuation was agreed to by Alkuri due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nIndications from Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors was expecting a valuation in the high $3 billions and would not accept anything less\nthan $3.5 billion\u037e\n\u2022\nAs a result of increasing visibility into, and comfort with, the prospect pipeline supporting Babylon Holdings\u2019 forecasted 2022 revenue\nprojections of approximately $710 million\u037e and\n\u2022\nIn light of Alkuri\u2019s belief that, based on its valuation work in consultation with Jefferies, the increased closing enterprise valuation\ncontinued to represent a meaningful discount to comparable median valuations.\nThe increase in the earnout opportunity was agreed to by Alkuri because it believed that the total economics of the deal continued to represent a\nmeaningful discount to the valuations of the Selected Peer Companies, particularly in light of its increasing visibility into, and comfort with, the prospect\npipeline supporting Babylon Holdings\u2019 forecasted 2022 revenue projections. Alkuri also agreed to the additional share priced vesting tiers because, while\nit might make the earnout more likely to be achieved in part, it would continue to incentivize management participants in the long-term incentive plan\ndescribed above in scenarios where one or both of the tiers in Alkuri\u2019s original proposal (of $15 and $20) were unlikely to be achieved, but the Babylon\nShares were nonetheless trading at a range that represented an outsized return to Alkuri Stockholders. In addition, Alkuri also believed that the additional\nshare priced vesting tiers might be beneficial to stock price performance because having four tiers (rather than two) at which the earnout vested on a\nratable basis, may help to alleviate or reduce any trading overhang that might result from two larger vesting tiers (with half of the consideration vesting at\neach tier).\nThe post-closing super-voting governance structure was agreed upon by Alkuri due to the existing governance terms held by the Founder\n(including shares that then currently provided him super-voting powers)\n124\nTable of Contents\nand in order to provide stability and allow the management team to focus on long-term shareholder value creation during an expected period of sustained\naccelerated growth and expansion.\nWhile Alkuri continued to field weekly update calls with the board of directors of Alkuri throughout this process, Alkuri also held a special meeting\nof the board of directors on the morning of April 7, 2021 in order to review the status of discussions with, and work completed on, Babylon Holdings. At\nthis special meeting it was determined that Alkuri should proceed to enter into an LOI with Babylon Holdings that contained mutual exclusivity\nobligations and, accordingly, discontinue discussions with the other Potential Target with whom discussions were ongoing on a letter of intent. This\ndetermination was made, among other things, based on Babylon Holdings\u2019 size, highly differentiated growth profile, a belief that Babylon Holdings\u2019\nposition was more defensible in its marketplace, more established and predictable operations and financial profile (including over the prior two years\nwhere Babylon Holdings had delivered on significant growth), visibility and confidence with respect to Babylon Holdings\u2019 ability to continue delivering\naccelerated growth compared to the Selected Peer Companies which were trading at meaningfully higher revenue multiples and the willingness of\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 shareholders and the request of Alkuri to \u201croll\u201d all of their equity in the potential business combination (and forego the opportunity to\nreceive cash consideration).\nLater in the day on April 7, 2021, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings entered into an LOI, with mutual exclusivity running through April 30, 2021. Babylon\nHoldings required exclusivity given the costs and resources they were going to devote to the potential business combination and Alkuri believed that\nthe relatively short exclusivity period would provide adequate opportunity for Alkuri to conduct further diligence and begin the process of negotiating\ndefinitive transaction documents, and if necessary abandon the transaction and pursue alternative business combination targets if there were any issues\nuncovered that in Alkuri\u2019s view would cause Alkuri to rethink the valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings in the LOI. This exclusivity period was\nultimately extended multiple times to June 4, 2021.\nOn April 12, 2021, Alkuri formally engaged Jefferies as its financial advisor in order to, among other things, provide financial advice on the potential\nbusiness combination with Babylon Holdings, assist Alkuri in requesting and analyzing due diligence information received from Babylon Holdings,\nreview financial information of Babylon Holdings, develop presentations for the Alkuri board of directors and provide other customary financial advisory\nand investment banking services. Alkuri selected Jefferies in part because of its pre-existing relationship with Jefferies (who had previously acted as the\nunderwriter for the Alkuri IPO), the likelihood of being able to obtain favorable economic terms from Jefferies (due to Jefferies having acted as the\nunderwriter for the Alkuri IPO) and Jefferies\u2019 extensive experience in healthcare and technology.\nOn April 12, 2021, Alkuri retained Jefferies to act as lead left placement agent on the PIPE Investment. At the request of Babylon Holdings, Alkuri\nalso retained Citi as an additional non-lead placement agent on the PIPE Investment in order to, among other things, ensure that Babylon Holdings had\ndirect visibility into the PIPE Investment process. Babylon Holdings had previously retained Ardea and Citi as its financial advisors in connection with\nthe merger, which will receive $7,500,000 and $4,000,000, respectively, and any additional amount at Babylon Holdings\u2019 discretion in fees for their\nrespective involvement in such transactions.\nAlso, on April 12, 2021, despite having previously operated under insulation walls between the Jefferies\u2019 team advising Alkuri and the team\nadvising Babylon Holdings, Jefferies formally withdrew from its pre-existing representation of Babylon Holdings in order to avoid the appearance of\nimpropriety or a conflict of interest.\nOn or about April 12, 2021, Alkuri began the process of formally wall-crossing certain prospective investors in the PIPE Investment (in addition to\nthe eight prospective investors discussed above that were previously brought-in by Alkuri under a non-disclosure agreement in order to consider the\npotential business combination with Babylon Holdings).\nOn April 16, 2021, in addition to the weekly meetings that, for the most part, continued to be held by Alkuri management with the board of directors\nof Alkuri, at the request of the independent directors of Alkuri (i.e.,\n125\nTable of Contents\nStephen Smith, Jason Harinstein and Katie May), Winston fielded a separate call with the independent directors of Alkuri. This meeting was requested by\nthe independent directors in order to obtain Winston\u2019s guidance on how best to oversee the work of Alkuri\u2019s management and advisors and to carry-out\nand execute their duties as fiduciaries of the Alkuri Stockholders. During this call, the independent directors also discussed the diligence process to date\nand the diligence process that would be conducted prior to the entry into any definitive agreements in respect of the potential business combination with\nBabylon Holdings.\nDuring the months of April and early May, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings (together with their respective advisors) engaged in a series of\ndiscussions regarding the considerations on the structuring of the potential business combination, including with respect to tax implications with respect\nthereto. During the course of these discussions, various structuring options were proposed and considered by the parties, including structures that\nmight provide Alkuri Stockholders with more certain tax treatments. However, following thorough exploration of these various structuring alternatives,\nBabylon Holdings indicated that it viewed the alternative structures as problematic from a tax perspective and was, therefore, unwilling to proceed with\nthe potential business combination on the basis of any structure other than that contemplated by the ultimate structure provided for in the Merger\nAgreement. Further, during the course of these discussions, various structuring options were proposed and considered by the parties with regard to the\nEarnout Shares and various terms and provisions were proposed and considered with respect to the dual class structure. After considering the various\noptions, the parties agreed upon the structure and terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement and Babylon Articles.\nAlso during the months of April and May, members of the Alkuri management team together with its advisors (including Jefferies, Winston,\nSheppard Mullin, Alkuri\u2019s healthcare and regulatory counsel (\u201cSheppard\u201d), Cary Olsen Jersey LLP, Alkuri\u2019s local counsel in Jersey, and Moss Adams LLP,\nAlkuri\u2019s tax, accounting and financial advisors (\u201cMoss Adams\u201d), Barrington Advisory Group, Alkuri\u2019s strategic, process and financial advisor\n(\u201cBarrington\u201d) and other advisors of Alkuri reviewing the business, product and technology of Babylon Holdings) engaged in a review of due diligence\nmaterials provided with respect to Babylon Holdings, held telephonic conferences and virtual meetings with the Babylon Holdings management team and\ntheir representatives in order to discuss commercial, regulatory, tax, legal and other elements of Babylon Holdings\u2019 business and future prospects. During\nthis time, Alkuri\u2019s management team and advisors also provided supplemental diligence requests based on the materials provided and the discussions\nduring such virtual meetings and received supplemental requests from Babylon Holdings in response.\nFollowing completion of preliminary due diligence and preliminary structuring discussions, it was determined that Alkuri would provide the first\ndraft of the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, on May 4, 2021, Winston sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to WSGR so that the Merger\nAgreement could be advanced in parallel with completion of structuring discussions, the PIPE Investment and Alkuri\u2019s due diligence. WSGR responded\nwith revised drafts on May 9, 2021 and an updated revised draft on May 12, 2021.\nStarting May 10, 2021, the leadership of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings (and, to the extent necessary, relevant advisors from each company), began\nholding daily update calls. During the course of these calls the leadership teams updated each other on process, open items and responsibilities.\nCommencing on May 14, 2021 through the signing of the Merger Agreement, Alkuri invited certain of its external advisors to join weekly update\ncalls with the Alkuri board of directors, in order to update the Alkuri board of directors on the status of negotiations with respect to the Merger\nAgreement and the results of due diligence.\nThe parties held a call on May 17, 2021, involving members of the Alkuri and the Babylon Holdings management team, along with representatives\nfrom Winston and WSGR in order to discuss material issues remaining in the Merger Agreement, which included deal certainty for Alkuri with respect to\nshareholder approvals and support arrangements to be delivered by shareholders of Babylon Holdings at or prior to signing,\n126\nTable of Contents\nallocation of risk in the representations and warranties and the covenants of each party, including the ability of the Alkuri board of directors to change its\nrecommendation to its stockholders to the extent required by law and Babylon Holdings\u2019 obligations with respect to post-closing tax filings.\nOn May 19, 2021, Winston provided WSGR with an updated draft of the Merger Agreement. Thereafter, the parties continued to negotiate the\nMerger Agreement, other ancillary documents and the disclosures schedules to the Merger Agreement.\nIn parallel with Alkuri\u2019s due diligence and the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, commencing on April 16 and extending through May 18, Alkuri\nand Babylon Holdings, with assistance from Jefferies, Citi and Pareto conducted over 65 investor meetings with potential investors. Commitments from\nsubscribers in the aggregate amount of $230 million were obtained from investors (including $13 million in the aggregate from Alkuri\u2019s Chairman, CEO,\nCFO and the Sponsor). In parallel with these discussions and the negotiations of the Merger Agreement, the parties negotiated with prospective PIPE\nInvestors the terms of their investment. Among the points negotiated for by the PIPE investors was the inclusion of a condition with respect to the\nfunding by each of the other PIPE Investors. Because this construct did not allow flexibility in the event any of the PIPE investors defaulted on their\ncommitment, Babylon Holdings and Alkuri negotiated for a reduction in this commitment to $210 million in funding by the PIPE Investors (assuming full\nfunding by the applicable subscriber), which provided the parties with $20 million in flexibility in the event of failures to fund (in whole or in part) by one\nor more PIPE Investors.\nOn May 31, 2021, the Alkuri board of directors held a special meeting to consider the terms of the Merger Agreement and the other definitive\nagreements contemplated thereby. At this meeting, Winston advised the members of the Alkuri board of directors of their fiduciary duties and\nsummarized the material transaction terms for the Alkuri board of directors. Following the overview provided by Winston, representatives from Jefferies\nreviewed for the Alkuri board of directors, management\u2019s valuation ascribed to Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and the\nfinancial projections for the combined business. Included in this presentation by Jefferies noted for the board of directors that the Transaction was priced\nbased upon forecasted 2022 revenue projections of $710 million for Babylon Holdings, with a 5.1x multiple ascribed to the 2022 revenue projections of\n$710 million. Jefferies noted that this multiple represented a 35% discount to the median peer multiple. Certain projections for 2023 were also included in\nthe presentation for the sole purpose of understanding trends with respect to CAGR compared to the Selected Peer Companies and whether the 5.1x\nmultiple ascribed to the 2022 revenue projection was reasonable. Following Jefferies\u2019 presentation, Winston and Sheppard summarized the legal and\nregulatory due diligence conducted during the course of the process and the results of that review. Thereafter, Moss Adams, Barrington Advisors and\nmembers of Alkuri management discussed the tax, business and accounting diligence conducted on Babylon Holdings. Both during and after these\nsummary reviews, the Alkuri board of directors engaged in extensive discussion, including with respect to the peer group selected by Alkuri management\nand Jefferies, the diligence comfort obtained with respect to the forecasted 2022 revenue projections and other matters. In particular, the board of\ndirectors of Alkuri asked questions on the diligence approach and ability of Alkuri management and its advisors to confirm Babylon Holdings\u2019 pipeline of\nprospects that provided support for the 2022 revenue projections. Alkuri management indicated that it had been provided access to Babylon Holdings\u2019\nsalesforce data in order to better understand the nature and extent of contacts with the pipeline of prospects.\nFollowing thorough discussion, the Alkuri board of directors determined to adjourn in order to afford directors more time to study the materials\npresented to the board of directors and to review the proposed Merger Agreement and the other definitive agreements contemplated thereby.\nBetween May 31, 2021 and June 3, 2021, Alkuri management and advisors also obtained additional information and comfort in order to assist it in\nthe independent validation of the pipeline of prospects supporting the forecasted 2022 revenue projections. This included a review of evidentiary\nsupport (such as emails or other communications) for the salesforce information previously reviewed by Alkuri, interviews with members of the Babylon\nHoldings sales team (and its leadership) and other pipeline tracking information.\n127\nTable of Contents\nAlso, between May 31, 2021 and June 3, 2021, Babylon Holdings and their advisors finalized the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements\ncontemplated thereby.\nOn June 3, 2021, via action taken by written consent, the Alkuri board of directors unanimously approved the entry into the Merger Agreement and\nthe Ancillary Agreements contemplated thereby.\nLater that day, Babylon Holdings and Alkuri issued a press release announcing the entry into the Merger Agreement.\nAlkuri\u2019s Reasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors\nThis explanation of Alkuri\u2019s reasons for the Business Combination and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature\nand, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled \u201cCautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOn June 3, 2021, via action taken by written consent, the Alkuri board of directors, among other things, unanimously (i) approved the Merger\nAgreement and related transaction agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) determined that the Business Combination is in the best\ninterests of Alkuri and its stockholders, and (iii) recommended that Alkuri\u2019s stockholders approve and adopt the Business Combination.\nBefore reaching the above decision, the Alkuri board of directors reviewed the results of the due diligence conducted by Alkuri\u2019s management,\nwhich included:\n\u2022\nreview of Babylon Holdings\u2019 material contracts, intellectual property, financial results and prospects, taxes, legal and regulatory issues,\nleased properties, environmental challenges, insurance, engineering and technical achievements and challenges, and financial accounting,\nincluding both audited and unaudited financial statements and internal controls\u037e\n\u2022\nmeetings and calls with the management team and advisors of Babylon Holdings regarding operations, forecasts and the Business\nCombination\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussions with Babylon Holdings regarding its addressable market and competitive landscape\u037e\n\u2022\nfinancial projections prepared by Babylon Holdings\u2019 management team\u037e and\n\u2022\nreview of analyst reports and market trends in the telehealth care sector, publicly traded comparable companies (including traditional and\nonline healthcare and medical device providers and category-leading de-SPAC companies), and comparable transactions in the broader\nhealthcare sector.\nAs described under \u201c\u2014The Background of the Business Combination\u201d above, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors, in evaluating the Business Combination,\nconsulted with Alkuri\u2019s management and advisors. In reaching its unanimous decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors considered a range of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed\nbelow. In light of the complexity of such factors, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors, as a whole, did not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or\notherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it took into account in reaching its decision. Individual members of Alkuri\u2019s board of directors\nmay have given different weight to different factors.\nIn considering the Business Combination, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors gave considerable weight to the following factors:\n\u2022\nVisionary Founder and World Class Management Team. Dr. Ali Parsadoust and the Babylon Holdings management team have a deep\nunderstanding of both their direct customers (payer entities) and end users (network participants) and, with over a century of collective\nexperience in healthcare and\n128\nTable of Contents\ntechnology, have the drive and competency to grow the business and provide healthcare in a manner that improves the end user\u2019s\nexperience and reduces costs for its customers. Importantly, in a space like healthcare, with large and entrenched incumbents and relatively\nhigh barriers to entry, Alkuri believes it is critical to combine the experience, competency and drive of a qualified and accomplished\nmanagement team like Babylon Holdings\u2019 with a proven entrepreneurial leader like Dr. Ali Parsadoust, who brings a bold vision to drive\nchange in the segment using technology and a customer-focused approach. Dr. Ali Parsadoust built the first private company to run a U.K.\nNational Health Service (NHS) hospital, Circle Health, which then became Europe\u2019s largest partnership of clinicians before going public in\n2012. Dr. Ali Parsadoust has been named by The Times among the 100 global people to watch, and by the Health Service Journal among the\n100 most influential people in U.K. healthcare.\n\u2022\nLarge market opportunity. The $10 trillion global healthcare market, is expected to grow over the coming decades and there is a clear need\nfor accessibility, quality and affordability. Alkuri also believes that the market is early in its adoption of technology, even in large economies\nlike the United States. To date, Babylon Holdings has deployed its technology in 16 countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong,\nSingapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Canada, the United States, Rwanda and the\nUnited Kingdom) and actively provides clinical services in three (the United States, the United Kingdom and Rwanda). Babylon Holdings is\nfocused on developing its technology and growing its existing market in the United States, which represents an almost $4 trillion healthcare\nmarket opportunity, while also planting roots in new geographical markets.\n\u2022\nDisruptors. Babylon Holdings is paving the way in the digital transformation of healthcare. By reengineering the healthcare value change\nand balancing accessibility, affordability and quality, Babylon Holdings is using its technology platform to connect users to clinical experts\nand provide virtual care, in-person medical care and post-care offerings. In Alkuri\u2019s view, Babylon Holding is unique in applying a mobile\nnative, digital-first approach at scale to proactive and preventative end-to-end healthcare, which disrupts the traditional in-person, reactive,\n\u201csick care\u201d model that is prevalent in health systems around the world. As evidenced by other market segments like retail and entertainment,\nAlkuri believes that digital-first platforms and products that are well- aligned to the changing needs of its customers can demonstrate more\nrapid growth, claim significant market share, and deliver the potential for outsized returns relative to their physical-first peers. As a digital-\nfirst disruptor that breaks the mold of a system dominated by clinic- and physical-first competitors, Alkuri believes Babylon Holdings\nrepresents a similar potential opportunity in the healthcare segment, as evidenced in particular by its accelerated growth in the United\nStates over the past year. For example, the median growth rate for 2019, 2020 and expected 2021 revenue for the Selected Peer Companies in\nboth integrated care and telemedicine was roughly 40% per year, based on publicly available information, including public filings, while the\nBabylon Holdings revenue growth rate for the same period is over 300% per year.\n\u2022\nNext generation technology. Babylon Holdings\u2019 artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) architecture and fully integrated technology platform is\ndesigned to help its members navigate their deeply-personal healthcare journeys. Babylon Holdings\u2019 AI has been designed with a focus on\ndelivering insights and efficiencies to members and clinicians. The AI\u2019s core features include: interpretability and explainability to provide a\nlayer of transparency over insights and, efficiencies, quantification on uncertainty providing for less uncertainty and more accurate\npredictions, data efficiency and flexibility enabling Babylon to adapt to multiple sources of information and consider latest clinical\nguidelines, public studies and multiple sources of medical knowledge. In addition, unlike many of its peers which either focus on bringing\npatients into their clinics or provide a single solution like fee-based telemedicine consultations, the broader technology platform is designed\nto help manage the end-to-end care for a member, and represents what Alkuri believes is the cutting edge of digital-first healthcare and a\nmulti-year advantage over \u201ctechnology enabled\u201d industry incumbents and others seeking to enter the market.\n\u2022\nScalable, durable business model Babylon Holdings\u2019 digital-first model is highly scalable and enables it to deliver fully-integrated,\npersonalized healthcare across the entire care spectrum through mobile\n129\nTable of Contents\ndevices the vast majority of individuals in Babylon Holdings\u2019 target markets already own or access. Alkuri expects healthcare spending to\ncontinue rising globally as the population in key markets like the United States continue to age, and Alkuri believes durable secular\nindustry trends toward digital solutions as well as value-based care will continue to drive adoption of digital healthcare services like those\noffered by Babylon Holdings. Babylon Holdings has shown an ability to find market fit and rapidly scale both its software licensing\nservices and value-based care services, yet the 24 million members served by Babylon Holdings represent a small fraction of the total\naddressable market. Alkuri believes Babylon Holdings\u2019 technology advantages can enable it to grow revenues on a rate basis faster than its\npeers, as it has for multiple years, by expanding the covered population and scope of services in its existing markets and customers,\nexpanding to new markets with new and existing customers, pursuing strategic partnership and inorganic growth through acquisitions and\ncontinuing to invest in technology and infrastructure to improve capabilities. Furthermore, while demand for and adoption of telemedicine\nsolutions has generally been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it has demonstrated its benefit and importance in reaching patients,\nBabylon Holdings believes that in the post-COVID-19 world, its technology and business model will enable it to outperform its competitors,\nin particular, those deploying a fee-for-services model who may have shown temporary increases in revenues.\n\u2022\nConsumer and Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) go-to-market characteristics While in many cases the contracted customers of the\nBabylon Holdings service will be a corporate entity like an insurance company, we believe that developing a strong consumer brand and\ndeep consumer relationships represents a significant opportunity for Babylon Holdings over time. Alkuri believes a unique characteristic of\nthe Babylon Holdings model is that, unlike most traditional \u201csick care\u201d systems in healthcare, which generally reward expensive and\nepisodic emergency care, Babylon Holdings\u2019 business and gross margin can actually improve as more members engage with the product,\nprovide data to enable preventative care, and avoid costly urgent care, emergency room and hospital visits. Alkuri expects that building\nstrong direct relationships and brand equity with Babylon Holdings\u2019 consumer members can create both significant potential bottom-line\nimprovements and retentive capacity for its payer clients and contracts while enhancing Babylon Holdings\u2019 overall market position and\nability to differentiate itself from its competitors. Alkuri\u2019s management\u2019s deep expertise in scaling consumer brands, business models and\nproducts, particularly in mobile, by using digital marketing strategies and technology-enabled salesforces to help scale businesses may be\ninstrumental in helping Babylon Holdings reach new customers and end users, and to build a differentiated brand positioning and\nawareness in a market that we believe is lacking in strong consumer-oriented brands.\n\u2022\nOrganic and inorganic growth potential Babylon Holdings has experienced robust growth in its early stages yet Alkuri sees significant\naddressable market expansion opportunities, with potential expansion in the United States and other new geographies, as well as potential\nopportunities for inorganic growth through acquisitions. Notably, the potential for market expansion and inorganic growth is not\ncontemplated in the current growth projections of Babylon Holdings.\n\u2022\nDefensible market position. The healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we\noperate are highly competitive, however most of Babylon Holdings\u2019 competitors are generally focused on one specific slice of the\nhealthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine), or are limited to specific and smaller\ngeographic ranges due to their reliance on operating owned physical locations, rather than delivering the entire healthcare needs of a\nmember on a national or even global basis. Babylon Holdings has developed a digital platform and business model that Alkuri believes will\nbe difficult for other companies in the healthcare and traditional fee-for-service space to emulate.\n\u2022\nAttractive Valuation. The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon\nHoldings at $3.515 billion (or 5.1x projected 2022E revenues of $710 million) which represents a sizeable discount to public trading market\nvaluations of comparable companies across digital and telehealth industries and digitally enabled healthcare providers. The set of\ncomparable companies to Babylon Holdings was selected based on the existing universe of publicly traded companies at\n130\nTable of Contents\nthe time of the transaction. Additionally, the valuation discount is relative to companies that are growing at lower rates than Babylon\nHoldings. Adjusting for Babylon Holdings\u2019 accelerated growth resulted in the valuation range representing an even more sizeable discount\nto its peers, which we believe positions the Business Combination as an attractive opportunity for Alkuri Stockholders.\nAlkuri\u2019s board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business\nCombination, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nPotential Inability to Complete the Business Combination. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility that the Business\nCombination may not be completed and the potential adverse consequences to Alkuri if the Business Combination is not completed, in\nparticular the expenditure of time and resources in pursuit of the Business Combination and the loss of the opportunity to participate in the\ntransaction. They considered the uncertainty related to factors outside of the control of the parties to the transaction. The Business\nCombination Agreement also includes an exclusivity provision that prohibits Alkuri from soliciting other initial business combination\nproposals, which restricts Alkuri\u2019s ability to consider other potential initial business combinations until the earlier of the termination of the\nMerger Agreement or the consummation of the Business Combination.\n\u2022\nThe Risk that Alkuri\u2019s Public Stockholders Would Vote Against the Business Combination Proposal or Exercise Their Redemption\nRights. The Alkuri board of directors considered the risk that some of the current public stockholders would vote against the Business\nCombination proposal or decide to exercise their redemption rights, thereby depleting the amount of cash available in the trust account to\nan amount below the minimum required to consummate the Business Combination. Further, the fact that public stockholders may vote for\nthe Business Combination proposal while also exercising their redemption rights mitigates against any incentive a public stockholder might\nhave to vote against the Business Combination proposal, especially to the extent that they hold public warrants which would be worthless\nif the Business Combination is not completed.\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 Business Risks. The Babylon Holdings board of directors considered that Babylon Stockholders would be subject to\nthe execution risks associated with Babylon Holdings if they retained their public shares following the Closing, which were different from\nthe risks related to holding public shares of Alkuri prior to the Closing. In this regard, the Alkuri board of directors considered that there\nwere risks associated with successful implementation of Babylon Holdings\u2019 long term business plan and strategy and Babylon Holdings\nrealizing the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination on the timeline expected or at all. The Alkuri board of directors considered\nthat the failure of any of these activities to be completed successfully may decrease the actual benefits of the Business Combination and\nthat Alkuri Stockholders may not fully realize these benefits to the extent that they expected to retain the public shares following the\ncompletion of the Business Combination. For additional description of these risks, please see \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\u2022\nPost-Business Combination Corporate Governance. The Alkuri board of directors considered the corporate governance provisions of the\nMerger Agreement and Babylon Holdings\u2019 anticipated organizational documents and the effect of those provisions on the governance of\nBabylon Holdings following the Closing. In particular, they considered that, assuming no redemptions by Alkuri Stockholders, the Founder\nwill individually control shares representing approximately 81.7% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 voting power (taking account of the Stockholder\nEarnout Shares) upon completion of the Business Combination and have the right to designate a majority of directors to the board of\ndirectors of Babylon Holdings for as long as he hold certain amounts of shares of Babylon Shares and will have a right to approve or reject\ntransactions involving Babylon Holdings. The Alkuri board of directors also considered the circumstances under which the \u201chigh vote\u201d\nstock would convert into \u201clow vote\u201d stock. The Alkuri board of directors was aware that these rights are not generally available to\nstockholders of Alkuri, including stockholders that may hold a large number of shares, or directors of Alkuri. See \u201cAgreements Entered Into\nin Connection with the Merger Agreement\u201d for detailed discussions of the terms and conditions of these agreements.\n131\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nNo Survival of Remedies for Breach of Representations, Warranties or Covenants by Babylon Holdings. The Alkuri board of directors\nconsidered that the terms of the Merger Agreement provide that neither Alkuri nor its stockholders will have any recourse against Babylon\nHoldings or its current shareholders after the Closing of the Business Combination to recover for losses as a result of any inaccuracies or\nbreaches of the Babylon Holdings representations, warranties or covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022\nLitigation. The Alkuri board of directors considered the possibility of litigation challenging the Business Combination or that an adverse\njudgment granting permanent injunctive relief could enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.\n\u2022\nFees and Expenses. The Alkuri board of directors considered the fees and expenses associated with completing the Business Combination,\nwhich it estimated as approximately $68.5 million.\n\u2022\nDiversion of Management. The Alkuri board of directors considered the potential for diversion of management and employee attention\nduring the period prior to the completion of the Business Combination, and the potential negative effects on Babylon Holdings\u2019 business.\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s Management and Directors May Have Different Interests in the Business Combination Than the Public Stockholders. The\nAlkuri board of directors also considered the fact that members of Alkuri\u2019s management and board of directors may have interests that are\ndifferent from, or are in addition to, the interests of its stockholders generally, including the matters described under \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014 Interests of Alkuri\u2019s Officers and Directors in the Transactions\u201d above. However, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors concluded that\nthe potentially disparate interests would be mitigated because (i) these interests were disclosed in the Alkuri IPO prospectus, and (ii) these\ndisparate interests would exist or may be even greater with respect to a business combination with another target company.\n\u2022\nRisks Related to the Dual-Class Share Structure. The Alkuri board of directors also considered the risk of concentrating voting control in\nthe dual-class share structure (with \u201csuper-voting\u201d rights for the Founder), but determined that they were outweighed by the long-term\nbenefits that a founder-controlled company would provide to Alkuri Stockholders and future shareholders of Babylon after Closing.\nUnaudited Projected Financial Information\nBabylon Holdings does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings, or other results. However, the management of\nBabylon Holdings has prepared the prospective financial information set forth below to present key elements to the forecasts provided to Alkuri. The\naccompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the\nguidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the\nbest of management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of Babylon Holdings. However,\nthis information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/prospectus\nare cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.\nNeither Babylon Holdings\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or\nperformed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form\nof assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial\ninformation.\nThe projections are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain and, though considered\nreasonable by Babylon Holdings\u2019 management as of the date of its\n132\nTable of Contents\npreparation, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those contained in the prospective financial information, including, among others, risks and uncertainties, as described in the \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d The prospective financial information is subjective in many respects\u037e\nand since the prospective financial information covers multiple years, that information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of Babylon Holdings or that actual results\nwill not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information. Furthermore, the prospective financial information does not take\ninto account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that information was prepared.\nThe financial projections were requested by, and disclosed to, Alkuri for use as a component in its overall evaluation of Babylon Holdings and are\nincluded in this proxy statement/prospectus on that account. Inclusion of the prospective financial information in this proxy statement/prospectus\nshould not be regarded as a representation by Babylon Holdings, Alkuri or any other person that the results contained in the prospective financial\ninformation will be achieved, and should not be regarded as an indication that Alkuri, the Alkuri board of directors, or their respective affiliates, advisors\nor other representatives considered, or now considers, such financial projections necessarily to be predictive of actual future results or to support or fail\nto support your decision whether to vote for or against the Business Combination. You are cautioned not to rely on the projections in making a decision\nregarding the transaction, as the projections may be materially different than actual results. We will not refer back to the financial projections in our future\nperiodic reports filed under the Exchange Act.\nBabylon Holdings does not expect to generally publish its business plans and strategies or make external disclosures of its anticipated financial\nposition or results of operations. Accordingly, Babylon Holdings does not intend to update or otherwise revise the prospective financial information to\nreflect circumstances existing since its preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying\nassumptions are shown to be in error. Furthermore, Babylon Holdings does not intend to update or revise the prospective financial information to reflect\nchanges in general economic or industry conditions.\nAdditional information relating to the principal assumptions used in preparing the projections is set forth below. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a\ndiscussion of various factors that could materially affect Babylon Holdings financial condition, results of operations, business, prospects and securities.\nThe key elements of the projections provided by management of Babylon Holdings to Alkuri are summarized in the table below (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\nRevenue\n321\n710\n1,484\n% growth\n305%\n121%\n109%\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n(140)\n(119)\n5\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue\n(44%)\n(17%)\n0%\nNet (loss)\n(206)\n(147)\n(33)\nNet loss as a percentage of revenue\n(64%)\n(21%)\n(2%)\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as profit (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization, net finance income (costs), income taxes, share-based\ncompensation, impairment expenses and foreign exchange gains or losses. For a description of how we calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nand the limitations of these non-IFRS financial measures, see \u201c\u2014Key Business and Financial Metrics\u2014 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 revenue projections are based on management\u2019s expectation of executed contracts delivering revenue in line with contractual\nterms. Additionally, Babylon Holdings\u2019 management expects to grow\n133\nTable of Contents\nits number of members as part of its Babylon 360 solution, delivering recurring revenue through the signing of additional contracts with both existing and\nnew customers. Finally, Babylon Holdings\u2019 management expects to sign new contracts, licensing out its technology platform. These revenue assumptions\nwere incorporated as part of Babylon Holdings\u2019 projections, with each of value based care, clinical services and software licensing revenue assumed to\ndeliver different adjusted EBITDA margin contributions. In addition to the above assumptions, projected adjusted EBITDA reflects management\u2019s\nexpectation of increasing headcount, marketing expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses with adjusted EBITDA margin improving over\nthe course of the projection.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 management and board of directors determined the reasonableness of the projections based upon the terms of executed\ncontracts, the status of current commercial discussions relating to the expansion of existing and execution of new contracts and consistency with our\nstrategic focus on growing our value-based care services. The projections reflected a probability weighting of the future revenue opportunities pipeline,\nprojections of cost of care delivery that reflect our historical experience of providing clinical and value-based care services, estimates of platform &\napplication expenses and research & development expenses that reflect our historical expenditures and projected technology roadmap and our expected\nincreases in sales, general and administration expenses. The cost projections as a proportion of revenue were additionally benchmarked against our own\nhistorical results and those disclosed by other businesses operating in similar markets. The projections were subject to review and approval by each\nmember of the senior leadership team with oversight of each business function and then subject to a final review by the Babylon Holdings board and\nfinance team, which resulted in an increase in the cost projections relating to some functions and the lowering of revenue projections provided by the\ncommercial team. The projections do not include the Higi acquisition as it was not contemplated at the time the projections were compiled.\nSatisfaction of 80% Test\nAfter consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section entitled \u201cProposal One\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Alkuri\u2019s\nReasons for the Business Combination and Recommendation of the Board of Directors,\u201d Alkuri\u2019s board of directors concluded that the Business\nCombination met all of the requirements disclosed in the prospectus for the Alkuri IPO with respect to Alkuri\u2019s initial business combination, including\nthat the Business Combination had a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of execution of the\nMerger Agreement.\nInterests of Certain Persons in the Business Combination\nSee \u201cSpecial Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders\u2014Interests of Alkuri\u2019s Officers and Directors in the Transactions\u201d and \u201cSpecial Meeting of Alkuri\nStockholders\u2014Interests of Babylon Holdings\u2019 Directors and Officers in the Business Combination\u201d.\nInvolvement of Underwriter of Alkuri IPO in the Transactions\nJefferies served as the sole underwriter for the Alkuri IPO and will receive approximately $12.1 million of deferred underwriting commissions\ntherefrom in connection with the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s initial business combination. Jefferies has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred\nunderwriting commissions held in the Trust Account in the event that Alkuri does not complete its initial business combination prior to the end of the\ncompletion window (subject to any extension period thereof), and in such a circumstance, will not receive any of such funds.\nAs described further below, Jefferies is also providing certain services in connection with the Transactions and will receive compensation in\nconnection therewith. Jefferies\u2019 receipt of the deferred underwriting commissions is not dependent on its provision of services in connection with the\nTransactions.\n134\nTable of Contents\nAs discussed under \u201cProposal No. 1\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Background of the Business Combination,\u201d Jefferies is serving as\nAlkuri\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies\u2019 engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to provide\nAlkuri with financial advice and assistance in connection with the Transactions, including providing financial advice on the potential business\ncombination with Babylon Holdings, assisting Alkuri in requesting and analyzing due diligence information received from Babylon Holdings, reviewing\nfinancial information of Babylon Holdings, developing presentations for the Alkuri board of directors and providing other customary financial advisory\nand investment banking services. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies will receive a financial advisory fee of $10 million (the \u201cJefferies\nFinancial Advisory Fee\u201d). Alkuri also has agreed to provide Jefferies with customary expense reimbursement, including fees and expenses of its counsel,\nand to indemnify it and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of Jefferies\u2019 financial advisory engagement and the Transactions. No entity\n(other than Jefferies) is serving as Alkuri\u2019s financial advisor in connection with the Transactions.\nAdditionally, as discussed under \u201cProposal No. 1\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Background of the Business Combination,\u201d Jefferies is\nserving as lead placement agent in connection with the PIPE Investment together with Citi and Pareto Securities AB. Pursuant to the terms of Jefferies\u2019\nplacement agent engagement with Alkuri, Jefferies has agreed to assist Alkuri in (i) identifying and contacting potential PIPE Investors, (ii) preparing an\ninvestor presentation and/or marketing materials for distribution to potential PIPE Investors, (iii) soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Babylon Class\nA shares pursuant to the PIPE Investment and (iv) negotiating the financial aspects of the PIPE Investment on Alkuri\u2019s behalf. In respect of such\nservices, upon the consummation of the Transactions, the placement agents, including Jefferies, will collectively receive a placement fee equal to 3.0% of\nthe aggregate price at which such Babylon Class A shares are sold pursuant to the PIPE Investment, which is expected to be $6.9 million in the aggregate\nand of which $738,000 will be payable to Jefferies (the \u201cJefferies Placement Fee\u201d), and whether or not the Transactions are consummated, Jefferies will\nreceive expense reimbursement customary for a PIPE transaction of this nature (subject to the terms and conditions of its engagement letter with Alkuri).\nAlkuri also has agreed to indemnify Jefferies and certain related persons against liabilities arising out of its placement agent engagement or information\ncontained in or omitted from the offering materials in connection with the PIPE Investment.\nBecause (i) Jefferies will only receive its deferred underwriting commissions upon the consummation of Alkuri\u2019s initial business combination during\nthe completion window (subject to any extension period thereof), (ii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Financial Advisory Fee upon the\nconsummation of the Transactions, and (iii) Jefferies will only receive the Jefferies Placement Fee upon the consummation of the Transactions, Jefferies\nhas an interest in the Transactions being consummated. Such interest may have presented, and may in the future present, a conflict of interest. Alkuri was\naware of and considered such potential conflicts in engaging Jefferies as its financial advisor and as lead placement agent. Alkuri\u2019s stockholders should\nconsider the role of Jefferies in evaluating \u201cProposal No. 1\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u201d and the other proposals.\nOn April 12, 2021, Alkuri retained Jefferies to act as lead left placement agent on the PIPE Investment. At the request of Babylon Holdings, Alkuri\nalso retained Citi as an additional non-lead placement agent on the PIPE Investment in order to, among other things, ensure that Babylon Holdings had\ndirect visibility into the PIPE Investment process. Babylon Holdings had previously retained Ardea and Citi as its financial advisors in connection with\nthe merger, who will receive $7,500,000 and $4,000,000 respectively, and any additional amount at Babylon Holdings\u2019 discretion in fees for their respective\ninvolvement in such transactions.\nAnticipated Accounting Treatment\nThe Transactions are comprised of a series of transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as described elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. For accounting purposes, the Transactions will be effectuated in three main steps:\n1.\nThe exchange of shares held by Babylon Holdings\u2019 shareholders, which is accounted for as a recapitalization in accordance with IFRS.\n135\nTable of Contents\n2.\nThe merger of Alkuri with Merger Sub, which is not within the scope of IFRS 3 (\u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d) since Alkuri does not meet the\ndefinition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Any difference between the fair value of Babylon Class A Shares issued and the fair\nvalue of Alkuri\u2019s identifiable net assets should to be recorded as a transaction expense related to the recapitalization. For purposes of the\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, it is assumed that the fair value of each individual Babylon Class A Share\nissued to Alkuri Stockholders is equal to the fair value of each individual Babylon shareholder resulting from the $3.515 billion equity value\nassigned to Babylon Holdings in the Merger Agreement.\n3.\nThe Subscription Agreements related to the PIPE Investment, which were executed concurrently with and following the Merger Agreement,\nwill result in the issuance of Babylon Class A Shares, leading to an increase in share capital and share premium.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Business Combination is not subject to any federal or state regulatory requirement or approval, except for the filings with the State of Delaware\nnecessary to effectuate the Business Combination.\nNo Appraisal Rights\nUnder Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the holders of Alkuri Common Stock will not have appraisal rights in\nconnection with the Business Combination.\nResale of Babylon Shares\nThe Babylon Class A Shares to be issued to Alkuri Stockholders (other than certain Babylon Class A Shares to be issued to the Sponsor) in\nconnection with the Business Combination will be freely transferable under the Securities Act except for shares issued to any shareholder who may be\ndeemed for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act an \u201caffiliate\u201d of Alkuri immediately prior to the Effective Time or an \u201caffiliate\u201d of Babylon\nfollowing the Business Combination. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are\nunder common control with, Babylon or Alkuri (as appropriate) and may include the executive officers, directors and significant shareholders of Babylon\nor Alkuri (as appropriate).\nStock Exchange Listing of Babylon Class A Shares\nBabylon Holdings will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, prior to the Effective Time, the Babylon Class A Shares and warrants\n(including Babylon Class A Shares and warrants issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement) to be approved for listing on the NYSE under the symbols\n\u201cBBLN\u201d and \u201cBBLN.W,\u201d respectively, subject to official notice of issuance. Approval of the listing on the NYSE of the Babylon Class A Shares (subject\nto official notice of issuance) is a condition to each party\u2019s obligation to complete the Business Combination.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Alkuri Securities\nIf the Business Combination is completed, shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock, Alkuri Warrants and Alkuri units will be delisted from Nasdaq\nand will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nImplications of being an \u201cEmerging Growth Company\u201d and a \u201cForeign Private Issuer\u201d\nEach of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings is, and consequently, following the Business Combination, Babylon will be, an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d\nas defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, Babylon will be eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions\nfrom various reporting\n136\nTable of Contents\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to\ncomply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in their periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find Babylon\u2019s securities less\nattractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Babylon\u2019s securities and the prices of Babylon\u2019s securities may be more volatile.\nBabylon will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the\nclosing of the Alkuri IPO, (b) in which Babylon has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which Babylon is deemed to be a large\naccelerated filer, which means the market value of Babylon\u2019s common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day\nof its most recently completed second fiscal quarter\u037e and (ii) the date on which Babylon has issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities during the prior three-year period. References herein to \u201cemerging growth company\u201d have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\nBabylon Holdings is also considered a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d and will report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with \u201cforeign private\nissuer\u201d status. This means that, even after Babylon Holdings no longer qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as long as it qualifies as a \u201cforeign\nprivate issuer\u201d under the Exchange Act, it will be exempt from certain provisions of and intends to take advantage certain exemptions from the Exchange\nAct that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including:\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under\nthe Exchange Act\u037e\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for\ninsiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time\u037e and\nBabylon Holdings may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until such time as it is no longer a \u201cforeign private issuer.\u201d Babylon Holdings\ncould lose its status as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 outstanding voting\nsecurities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of the Babylon Holding\u2019s\ndirectors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents\u037e (ii) more than 50% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 assets are located in the United States\u037e or (iii)\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 business is administered principally in the United States.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. Babylon Holdings has taken advantage of reduced\nreporting requirements in this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus may be different\nfrom the information you receive from Babylon Holdings\u2019 competitors that are public companies, or other public companies in which you have made an\ninvestment. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts with the United\nStates.\nVote Required for Approval\nThe approval of the Business Combination Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of\nAlkuri Common Stock. The failure to attend (or provide a proxy) or abstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cagainst\u201d the Business Combination\nProposal. Brokers are not entitled to vote on the Business Combination Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder and, consequently,\nbroker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cagainst\u201d the Business Combination Proposal.\nThe approval of the Business Combination Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Transactions. If the Business Combination Proposal\nis not approved, the other proposals (except the Adjournment Proposal, as described below) will not be presented to Alkuri Stockholders for a vote.\n137\nTable of Contents\nRecommendation of Alkuri Board of Directors\nTHE ALKURI BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE\nAPPROVAL OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL.\n138\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "PROPOSAL TWO\u2014THE EQUITY PLAN PROPOSAL\nOverview\nWe are seeking shareholder approval for the Babylon Holdings Limited 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2021 Plan\u201d). The 2021 Plan is being\nadopted by Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and will become effective upon the Closing. The 2021 Plan is intended to\nreplace Babylon Holding\u2019s Prior Plans (as defined below). Shareholder approval of the 2021 Plan is being sought in accordance with the Merger\nAgreement. Approval of the 2021 Plan will allow Babylon to provide equity awards as part of Babylon\u2019s compensation program, an important tool for\nmotivating, attracting and retaining talented employees and for creating shareholder value. Non-approval of the 2021 Plan may compel Babylon to\nsignificantly increase the cash component of employee compensation following the Closing to attract and retain key employees because Babylon would\nneed to replace components of compensation Babylon Holdings historically delivered in the form of equity awards, which could therefore reduce\nBabylon\u2019s operating cash flow.\nThe Alkuri board of directors believes that long-term incentive compensation programs align the interests of management, employees and\nshareholders to create long-term shareholder value. Equity plans such as the 2021 Plan increase Babylon\u2019s ability to achieve this objective, and, by\nallowing for several different forms of long-term incentive awards, helps Babylon recruit, reward, motive, and retain talented personnel. The Babylon\nHoldings board of directors believes that the approval of the 2021 Plan is essential to Babylon\u2019s continued success, and in particular, Babylon\u2019s ability to\nattract and retain outstanding and highly skilled individuals in the extremely competitive labor markets in which Babylon will compete. Equity awards are\nalso crucial to Babylon\u2019s ability to motivate employees to achieve its goals.\nKey Plan Provisions\n\u2022\nThe 2021 Plan will continue until the 10th anniversary of the Closing, unless earlier terminated by the Babylon board of directors of directors\nor its delegee\u037e\n\u2022\nThe 2021 Plan provides for the grant of share options (including \u201cincentive stock options\u201d within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,\nand options that are not incentive stock options), share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, and other share based\nawards\u037e\n\u2022\n45,335,210 Babylon Class A Shares will be authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, plus up to 23,902,282 Babylon\nClass A Shares that may become available for issuance as a result of recycling of awards under Babylon Holdings\u2019 Long Term Incentive\nPlan with Non-Employee Sub-Plan and Babylon Holdings\u2019 Company Share Option plan (the \u201cPrior Plans\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe 2021 Plan provides for an automatic share reserve increase feature, whereby the share reserve will automatically be increased on the\nfirst day of each fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to the least of\n(i) 5% of the total number of Class A Shares outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, (ii) 45,335,210 Babylon Class A\nShares or (iii) such number of Babylon Class A Shares as the board of directors may designate prior to the applicable January 1. The\nautomatic share reserve feature will cease immediately after the increase on the first day of the 2031 fiscal year.\n\u2022\nThe 2021 Plan will be administered by the Babylon board of directors or, if designated by the Babylon board of directors, Babylon\u2019s\ncompensation committee or another committee.\nSummary of the 2021 Plan\nThe following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal features of the 2021 Plan and its operation. However, this summary is not a complete\ndescription of all of the provisions of the 2021 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the specific language of the 2021 Plan. A copy of the 2021 Plan is\nattached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.\n139Table of Contents\nThe purpose of the 2021 Plan is to enhance Babylon\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are expected to make) important\ncontributions to Babylon by providing these individuals with equity ownership opportunities. These incentives will be provided through the grant of\nshare options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, or other share based awards as the administrator may determine. The\n2021 Plan and all awards thereunder will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.\nEligibility\nThe 2021 Plan provides for the grant of \u201cincentive stock options,\u201d within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, to Babylon\u2019s employees and any\nparent and subsidiary corporations\u2019 employees, and for the grant of other share options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share\nunits, and other share based awards to employees and consultants of Babylon and its subsidiaries and directors of Babylon, provided that consultants\nand directors who are not employees are only eligible to be granted awards under the Non-Employee Sub-Plan (the holder of an award is referred to here\nas a \u201cparticipant\u201d). The actual number of individuals who will receive awards under the 2021 Plan cannot be determined in advance because the\nadministrator has the discretion to select the participants on the basis of their service to Babylon and its subsidiaries. We expect Babylon and its\nsubsidiaries to have as of immediately following the Closing, approximately 3 non-employee directors, 1,200 full-time employees (including our employee\ndirectors), 600 part-time employees and 0 consultants who would be eligible to participate in the 2021 Plan.\nAuthorized Shares\nSubject to the adjustment provisions contained in the 2021 Plan and the evergreen provision described below, the maximum aggregate number of\nBabylon Class A Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan is (i) 45,335,210 Babylon Class A Shares, plus (ii) any Babylon Class\nA Shares subject to share options granted under the Prior Plans and which are subsisting on the Closing Date and expire, lapse or are terminated,\nexchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased or cancelled without having been fully exercised, or withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation\nterminate as a result of being unexercised or forfeited to or repurchased by Babylon, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2021 Plan\npursuant to clause (ii) equal to 23,902,282 Babylon Class A Shares. The 2021 Plan also includes an evergreen provision that provides for an automatic\nannual increase to the number of Babylon Class A Shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the\n2022 fiscal year, equal to the least of:\n\u2022\n45,335,210 Babylon Class A Shares\u037e\n\u2022\n5% of the total number of all classes of Babylon shares outstanding as of the last day of its immediately preceding fiscal year\u037e or\n\u2022\nSuch lesser amount determined by the administrator.\nThe 2021 Plan provides that the evergreen provision will terminate following the increase on the first day of the 2031 fiscal year.\nIf all or any part of an award or awards granted under the 2021 Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) expires, lapses or is terminated,\nexchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased or cancelled without having been fully exercised, or is withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in\nconnection with an award or to satisfy a purchase or exercise price of an award, the unused Babylon Class A Shares covered by the award or awards\ngranted under the 2021 Plan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan) will, as applicable, become or again be available for awards granted under the 2021\nPlan (including the Non-Employee Sub-Plan).\nIn the event of any return of capital (including a share dividend (whether payable in the form of cash, shares, or any other form of consideration)),\nbonus issue of shares or other Babylon securities by way of capitalization of\n140\nTable of Contents\nprofits, distribution, share split, reverse share split, spin-off, rights offering, re-designation, redenomination, consolidation recapitalization through a\nlarge, nonrecurring cash dividend, or any similar equity restructuring transaction, that affects the number or class of shares (or other Babylon securities)\nor the nominal value of Babylon Class A Shares (or other Babylon securities) and causes a change in the per share value of the Babylon Class A Shares\nunderlying outstanding awards (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the conversion of any convertible securities of Babylon), the administrator will\nequitably adjust (i) class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the 2021 Plan, (ii) the class(es) and maximum number of shares that may be issued\npursuant to the exercise of \u201cincentive stock options\u201d and (iii) each outstanding award as it deems appropriate to reflect such transaction, which may\ninclude adjusting the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding award and/or the award\u2019s exercise price or grant price (if applicable),\ngranting new awards to award holders, and making a cash payment to award holders.\nThe price of Babylon Holdings ordinary shares as determined in connection with the Business Combination is $3.02 per share.\nPlan Administration\nTo the extent that the applicable laws permit, the Babylon board of directors may delegate any or all of its powers under the 2021 Plan to one or\nmore committees or officers of Babylon or any of its subsidiaries. The Babylon board of directors may abolish any committee or re-vest in itself any\npreviously delegated authority at any time.\nThe administrator has authority to (i) determine which service providers receive awards, (ii) grant awards, and (iii) set award terms and conditions,\nin each case subject to the conditions and limitations in the 2021 Plan and all applicable laws. The administrator also has the authority to take all actions\nand make all determinations under the 2021 Plan, to approve the forms of award agreements for use under the 2021 Plan, to interpret the 2021 Plan and the\nterms of awards and to adopt, amend and repeal administrative rules, guidelines and practices as it deems advisable. The administrator may correct\ndefects and ambiguities, supply omissions and reconcile inconsistencies in the 2021 Plan or any award as it deems necessary or appropriate to administer\nthe 2021 Plan and any awards. The administrator\u2019s determinations under the 2021 Plan are in its sole discretion and will be final and binding on all persons\nhaving or claiming any interest in the 2021 Plan or any award.\nShare Options and Share Appreciation Rights\nOptions and share appreciation rights may be granted under the 2021 Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan, the administrator will\ndetermine the terms and conditions of options, including when such options vest and become exercisable (and the administrator will have the discretion\nto accelerate the time at which such options will vest or become exercisable). The administrator will establish each option\u2019s and share appreciation right\u2019s\nexercise price and specify the exercise price in the award agreement. The exercise price will be no less than the nominal value of a Babylon Class A Share,\nprovided that, in respect of participants who are subject to tax in the United States, the exercise price generally may not be less than less than 100% of the\nfair market value of a Babylon Class A Share on the grant date of the option or share appreciation right, and, provided further that, in respect of\nparticipants who own 10% of the voting power of all classes of equity securities of Babylon or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations, the exercise\nprice of an \u201cincentive stock option\u201d generally may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of a Babylon Class A Share on the grant date of the\noption or share appreciation rights. The term of an option or share appreciation right generally cannot exceed 10 years, provided that, in respect of\nparticipants who own 10% of the voting power of all classes of equity securities of Babylon or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations, the term of an\n\u201cincentive stock option\u201d generally may not be more than five years. After a participant\u2019s service terminates, he or she generally may exercise the vested\nportion of his or her option for the period of time stated in his or her option agreement.\nRestricted Shares and Restricted Share Units\nRestricted shares and restricted share units may be granted under the 2021 Plan. Restricted share awards are grants of shares that vest in\naccordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. Restricted\n141\nTable of Contents\nshare units are bookkeeping entries representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share. The administrator will determine the number of\nshares of restricted shares or restricted share units granted to any service provider and may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be\nappropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to Babylon\nor its subsidiaries), and the administrator will have the discretion to accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Dividends or\ndividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any restricted shares or restricted share units, as determined (and on such\nterms as may be determined) by the administrator and specified in the award agreement, subject to applicable law. Unless otherwise determined by the\nadministrator, a participant holding restricted shares will have voting and other rights as a shareholder of Babylon with respect to such restricted shares,\nexcept that any redesignation and subsequent redemption and forfeiture provisions of Babylon will apply. A participant holding restricted share units will\nhave no rights of a shareholder with respect to such restricted share units unless and until the shares are delivered in settlement of the restricted share\nunits.\nOther Share Based Awards\nOther share based awards may be granted to service providers, including awards entitling service providers to receive Babylon Class A Shares to\nbe delivered in the future (whether based on specified performance criteria, performance goals or otherwise), in each case subject to any conditions and\nlimitations in the 2021 Plan. Such other share based awards will also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone\npayments and as payment in lieu of compensation to which a service provider is otherwise entitled. Other share based awards may be paid in Babylon\nClass A Shares or other property, as the administrator determines. Subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan, the administrator will determine the terms\nand conditions of each other share based award, including any purchase price, performance condition, performance goal, transfer restrictions, and\nvesting conditions, which will be set forth in the applicable award agreement.\nNon-Transferability of Awards\nExcept as the administrator may determine or provide in an award agreement or otherwise for awards, awards may not be sold, assigned,\ntransferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during\nthe life of the participant, will be exercisable only by the participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit\ntransfer of an award pursuant to a domestic relations order or in such other manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws upon the\nparticipant\u2019s request and provided that the participant and the transferee enter into a share transfer and other agreements as required by Babylon. If an\noption is an \u201cincentive stock option,\u201d such option may be deemed to no longer qualify as an \u201cincentive stock option\u201d as a result of a transfer.\nCorporate Events\nIn the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, amalgamation, repurchase, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or sale,\ntransfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale or exchange of Shares or other securities of Babylon\nor a \u201cchange in control\u201d (referred to here as a \u201ccorporate event\u201d), the administrator, on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, is hereby\nauthorized to take any one or more of the actions set forth in the 2021 Plan whenever the administrator determines that such action is appropriate,\nincluding that an award be continued or substituted by the successor corporation, that vesting and exercisability of an award may accelerate\nautomatically upon consummation of the transaction, or that the unvested portions of an award may be terminated without consideration. The\nadministrator need not take the same action or actions with respect to all awards or portions thereof or with respect to all participants. The administrator\nmay take different actions with respect to the vested and unvested portions of an award.\n142\nTable of Contents\nClawback\nAll awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit the participant actually or constructively receives upon receipt or exercise of\nany award or the receipt or resale of any Babylon Class A Shares underlying the award) will be subject to Babylon claw-back policy that may be adopted\nfrom time to time to the extent such policy applies to the relevant participant, including any claw-back policy adopted to comply with applicable laws\n(including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder) as set forth in such\nclaw-back policy or the award agreement, to the extent applicable and permissible under applicable laws. No recovery of compensation under such a claw-\nback policy will be an event giving rise to a participant\u2019s right to voluntary terminate employment upon a \u201cresignation for good reason,\u201d or for a\n\u201cconstructive termination\u201d or any similar term under any plan of or agreement with the Company.\nAmendment or Termination\nThe Plan will come into existence on the day it is adopted by the Alkuri board of directors but no awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan prior\nto the Closing. Unless earlier terminated by the Babylon board of directors, the 2021 Plan will remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the Closing,\nbut Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date in accordance with the 2021 Plan. No \u201cincentive stock options\u201d may be granted after the\ntenth anniversary of the earlier of (i) the date the 2021 Plan is adopted by the Board, or (ii) the date the 2021 Plan is approved by Alkuri Stockholders. The\nadministrator may amend, suspend or terminate the 2021 Plan at any time\u037e provided that no amendment, suspension or termination may materially impair\nany award outstanding at the time of such amendment without the affected participant\u2019s written consent. No awards may be granted under the 2021 Plan\nduring any suspension period or after 2021 Plan termination. Awards outstanding at the time of any 2021 Plan suspension or termination will continue to\nbe governed by the 2021 Plan and the award agreement, as in effect before such suspension or termination. The Babylon board of directors will obtain\nshareholder approval of any amendment to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws.\nSummary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following summary is intended only as a general guide to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2021 Plan. The\nsummary is based on existing U.S. laws and regulations as of July 2021, and there can be no assurance that those laws and regulations will not change in\nthe future. The summary does not purport to be complete and does not discuss the tax consequences upon a participant\u2019s death, or the provisions of the\nincome tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which the participant may reside. As a result, tax consequences for any particular\nparticipant may vary based on individual circumstances. Interested parties should consult their own tax advisors as to specific tax consequences,\nincluding the application and effect of foreign, state and local laws.\nIncentive Stock Options\nA participant recognizes no taxable income for regular income tax purposes as a result of the grant or exercise of an option that qualifies as\n\u201cincentive stock option\u201d under Section 422 of the Code. If a participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares\nacquired through the exercise the option after both the two-year anniversary of the date the option was granted and the one-year anniversary of the\nexercise, the participant will recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the sale price of the shares and the exercise price, and we will\nnot be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes.\nHowever, if the participant disposes of such shares either on or before the two-year anniversary of the date of grant or on or before the one-year\nanniversary of the date of exercise (a \u201cdisqualifying disposition\u201d), any gain up to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise\nover the exercise price generally will be taxed as ordinary income, unless the shares are disposed of in a transaction in which the participant would\n143\nTable of Contents\nnot recognize a gain (such as a gift). Any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain. If a loss is recognized, there will be no ordinary income, and\nsuch loss will be a capital loss. Any ordinary income recognized by the participant upon the disqualifying disposition of the shares generally should be\ndeductible by us for federal income tax purposes, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.\nFor purposes of the alternative minimum tax, the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise\ndate is treated as an adjustment item in computing the participant\u2019s alternative minimum taxable income in the year of exercise. In addition, special\nalternative minimum tax rules may apply to certain subsequent disqualifying dispositions of the shares or provide certain basis adjustments or tax credits.\nNonstatutory Stock Options\nA participant generally recognizes no taxable income as the result of the grant of such an option. However, upon exercising the option, the\nparticipant normally recognizes ordinary income equal to the amount that the fair market value of the shares on such date exceeds the exercise price. If the\nparticipant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of the shares\nacquired by the exercise of such an option, any gain or loss (based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the exercise date)\nwill be taxed as capital gain or loss. No tax deduction is available to us with respect to the grant of such an option or the sale of the shares acquired\nthrough the exercise of such an option, provided that we generally will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\nordinary income realized by the optionee in the year of exercise.\nShare Appreciation Rights\nIn general, no taxable income is reportable when a share appreciation right is granted to a participant. Upon exercise, the participant generally will\nrecognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of any shares received. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income\ngenerally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares\nwould be capital gain or loss.\nRestricted Share Awards\nA participant acquiring restricted shares generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date\n(i.e., the date restrictions on the shares lapse). If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and\nemployment taxes. The participant may elect, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code to accelerate the ordinary income tax event to the date of acquisition\nby filing an election with the IRS no later than thirty days after the date the shares are acquired. Upon the sale of shares acquired pursuant to a restricted\nshare award, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the date the ordinary income tax event occurs,\nwill be taxed as capital gain or loss.\nRestricted Share Unit Awards\nThere are no immediate tax consequences of receiving an award of restricted share units. A participant who is awarded restricted share units\ngenerally will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of shares issued to such participant at the end of the\napplicable vesting period or, if later, the settlement date elected by the administrator or a participant. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary\nincome generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of any\nshares received would be capital gain or loss.\n144\nTable of Contents\nSection 409A\nSection 409A of the Code provides certain requirements for non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements with respect to an individual\u2019s\ndeferral and distribution elections and permissible distribution events. Awards granted under the 2021 Plan with a deferral feature will be subject to the\nrequirements of Section 409A. If an award is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that award may recognize\nordinary income on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is actually or\nconstructively received. Also, if an award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with Section 409A\u2019s provisions, Section 409A imposes an\nadditional 20% federal income tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income on the participant, as well as interest on such deferred compensation.\nThe administrator may, without participant consent, amend the 2021 Plan or awards, adopt policies and procedures or take any other actions intended to\npreserve the tax treatment of awards under the 2021 Plan, including any such actions intended to exempt the 2021 Plan or awards thereunder from Section\n409A or comply with Section 409A.\nTax Effect for Babylon\nBabylon generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2021 Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income\nrealized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option) except to the\nextent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code. Special rules limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our chief executive\nofficer and certain \u201ccovered employees\u201d as determined under Section 162(m) and applicable guidance. Under Section 162(m), the annual compensation\npaid to any of these specified individuals will be deductible only to the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000.\nTHE FOREGOING IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION UPON PARTICIPANTS AND BABYLON\nWITH RESPECT TO AWARDS UNDER THE 2021 PLAN. IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE AND DOES NOT DISCUSS THE IMPACT\nOF EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER TAX REQUIREMENTS, THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF A PARTICIPANT\u2019S DEATH, OR THE PROVISIONS OF\nTHE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE, OR FOREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANT MAY RESIDE.\nNew Plan Benefits\nThe benefits or amounts that an employee, director, or consultant may receive under the 2021 Plan is in the discretion of the administrator and\ntherefore cannot be determined in advance. Alkuri has not previously sponsored an equity incentive plan, and, therefore, the aggregate number of\nBabylon Class A Shares, which would have been received by or allocated to our named executive officers\u037e executive officers, as a group\u037e directors who\nare not executive officers, as a group\u037e and all other current employees who are not executive officers, as a group is not currently determinable. The value\nof future awards granted under the 2021 Plan will depend on a number of factors, including the fair market value of the ordinary shares on future dates,\nthe exercise decisions made by the participants and the extent to which any applicable performance goals necessary for vesting or payment are achieved.\nBabylon will grant share options to three Babylon employees under the 2021 Plan, effective as of the Closing and subject to the employee continuing to\nprovider service through the Closing, as agreed by Parties.\nEmployee Compensation Plan Information\nAlkuri did not maintain, or have any securities authorized for issuance under, any equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2020.\n145\nTable of Contents\nVote Required for Approval\nApproval of the 2021 Plan requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the\nspecial meeting. Failure to vote by proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, or a broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of the vote\non this proposal.\nResolution\nThe full text of the resolution to be passed is as follows:\n\u201cRESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution, that the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and any form award agreements thereunder, be\napproved, ratified and confirmed in all respects.\u201d\nRecommendation of the Alkuri board of directors:\nTHE ALKURI BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS VOTE \u201cFOR\u201d THE\nAPPROVAL OF THE EQUITY PLAN PROPOSAL.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of Alkuri\u2019s directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such\ndirector(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of Alkuri and its shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best\nfor himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that shareholders vote for the proposals. In addition, Alkuri\u2019s officers have interests in the\nBusiness Combination that may conflict with your interests as a shareholder. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party\nTransactions\u201d for a further discussion of these considerations.\n146\nTable of Contents",

All\nAlkuri Stockholders are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the\nBusiness Combination.\nThe Merger Agreement summary below is included in this proxy statement/prospectus only to provide you with information regarding the terms\nand conditions of the Merger Agreement and not to provide any other factual information regarding Alkuri, Babylon or their respective businesses.\nAccordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read\nonly in conjunction with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nTerms of the Merger\u037e Reclassification\u037e Merger Consideration\nPrior to the Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of Babylon Holdings will be reclassified into Babylon\nClass A Shares, other than the Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of the Reclassification,\neach outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the\n$3.515 billion equity value of Babylon Holdings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder. The Babylon Class B Shares\nwill have the same economic terms as the Babylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Babylon Class\nA Share will have one vote per share).\nAt the Closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into Alkuri, with Alkuri continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of\nBabylon. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock (excluding shares held in treasury by Alkuri) will be\nautomatically converted into the right to receive one (1) Babylon Class A Share.\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon\nShares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power\nof Babylon\u037e (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and\n0.6% of the voting power of Babylon\u037e and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and\n95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon being held by the\nFounder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately\nfollowing the Business Combination\u037e (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata\nportion of the funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being\npurchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE\nInvestment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no\nredemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Transactions\nThe Closing of the Transactions will take place as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the third business day following\nthe satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d) and summarized below under the subsection entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Conditions to Closing of the Transactions,\u201d unless Alkuri and Babylon agree in writing to another time or unless the Merger\nAgreement is terminated pursuant to its terms.

        "Section Text": "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations for U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined\nbelow, and together, \u201cHolders\u201d) of Alkuri Common Stock and warrants exercisable for shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock (\u201cAlkuri Warrants\u201d and,\ntogether with Alkuri Common Stock, each, an \u201cAlkuri Security\u201d) (other than the Sponsor or any of its affiliates) of (i) electing to have their Alkuri\nCommon Stock redeemed for cash if the Business Combination is completed, (ii) the Business Combination, and/or (iii) the ownership and disposition of\nBabylon Class A Shares and warrants exercisable for Babylon Class A Shares (the \u201dBabylon Warrants\u201d) after the Business Combination. This section\napplies only to Holders that hold their Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares, and Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, as \u201ccapital assets\u201d for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, because the components of an Alkuri unit are\ngenerally separable at the option of the Holder, the Holder of an Alkuri unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the\nowner of the underlying Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrant components of the Alkuri unit. Accordingly, the separation of an Alkuri unit into the\none share of Alkuri Common Stock and the one-fourth of one Alkuri Warrant underlying the Alkuri unit generally should not be a taxable event for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. This position is not free from doubt, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not\nsustain, a contrary position. Holders of Alkuri Securities are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and any non-U.S.\ntax consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination (including any redemption of Alkuri Common Stock) with respect to\nany Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants held through Alkuri units (including alternative characterizations of Alkuri units). This discussion\ngenerally assumes that the characterization of Alkuri units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThis discussion is included for general informational purposes only, does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that\nmight be relevant to a Holder, and does not constitute, and is not, a tax opinion for or tax advice to any particular Holder. This discussion is limited to U.S.\nfederal income tax considerations and does not address estate or any gift tax considerations or considerations arising under the tax laws of any state,\nlocal or non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address any tax consequences to investors that directly or indirectly hold equity\ninterests in Babylon prior to the Business Combination. With respect to consequences of holding Babylon Class A Shares, this discussion is limited to\nholders who acquire such Babylon Class A Shares in connection with the Business Combination or as a result of the exercise of a Babylon Warrant, and\nwith respect to Babylon Warrants, this discussion is limited to holders who hold such Babylon Warrants as a result of their ownership of Alkuri Warrants\nprior to and through the Business Combination. This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant\nto you in light of your particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on certain investment income and the different\nconsequences that may apply if you are subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law that apply to certain types of investors, such as:\n\u2022\nfinancial institutions or financial services entities\u037e\n\u2022\nbroker-dealers\u037e\n\u2022\ntaxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules with respect to the Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares and/or\nBabylon Warrants, as the case may be\u037e\n\u2022\npersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares and/or\nBabylon Warrants, as the case may be, as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt entities\u037e\n\u2022\ngovernments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nmutual funds\u037e\n164Table of Contents\n\u2022\npension plans\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\npartnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\npersons that actually or constructively own five percent or more (by vote or value) of Alkuri Common Stock, or, following the Business\nCombination, Babylon Class A Shares (except as specifically provided below)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Sponsor or its affiliates, officers or directors\u037e\n\u2022\nS corporations\u037e\n\u2022\ntrusts and estates\u037e\n\u2022\npersons that acquired their Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, pursuant to an exercise of\nemployee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation\u037e\n\u2022\npersons who purchase Babylon Class A Shares as part of the PIPE Investment\u037e\n\u2022\npersons that hold their Alkuri Securities or who will hold Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants as part of a straddle, constructive\nsale, constructive ownership transaction, hedging, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e or\n\u2022\n\u201cspecified foreign corporations\u201d (including \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d), \u201cpassive foreign investment companies\u201d or corporations\nthat accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax.\nIf a partnership (or any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class\nA Shares and/or Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, the tax treatment of such partnership and a person treated as a partner of such partnership will\ngenerally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding any Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares\nand/or Babylon Warrants, and persons that are treated as partners of such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences to them. This discussion also assumes that any distribution made (or deemed made) on Alkuri Common Stock and any\nconsideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of Alkuri Common Stock will be in U.S. dollars.\nThis discussion is based on the Code, proposed, temporary and final Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative\ninterpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax\nconsiderations described herein.\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any rulings from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax considerations described herein. There\ncan be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions inconsistent with the considerations discussed below or that any such positions would not be\nsustained by a court.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE\nBUSINESS COMBINATION, EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE ALKURI COMMON STOCK AND THE OWNERSHIP\nAND DISPOSITION OF BABYLON CLASS A SHARES AND BABYLON WARRANTS. EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE FOREGOING, INCLUDING THE\nAPPLICABILITY AND EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\n165\nTable of Contents\nU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF BABYLON\nTax Residence of Babylon for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes\nAlthough Babylon is organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off\nthe coast of Normandy, France, the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and therefore a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a U.S. \u201cdomestic\u201d\ncorporation (or U.S. tax resident) if it is organized in the United States, and a corporation is generally considered a \u201cforeign\u201d corporation (or non-U.S. tax\nresident) if it is not a U.S. corporation. Because Babylon is an entity which is organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, it\nwould generally be classified as a foreign corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under\nwhich a foreign incorporated and foreign tax resident entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\nUnder Section 7874 of the Code, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will nevertheless be\ntreated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the\nassets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring the outstanding\nshares of the U.S. corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 80% (or 60% if the Third Country\nRule, as defined herein, applies) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired\ncorporation (the \u201cSection 7874 Percentage\u201d), and (iii) the foreign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not have substantial business activities\nin the foreign corporation\u2019s country of organization relative to such expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities (the \u201cSubstantial Business Activities\nException\u201d). In order to satisfy the Substantial Business Activities Exception, at least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), real and\ntangible assets and gross income of the foreign acquiring corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d must be based, located and derived, respectively, in\nthe country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is a tax resident after the acquisition. The Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 7874 of\nthe Code (the \u201cSection 7874 Regulations\u201d) generally also provide that if (i) there is an acquisition of substantially all of the assets held directly or\nindirectly by a U.S. corporation after which the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 60% of the shares of the\nforeign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation, and (ii) in a related acquisition, such foreign acquiring\ncorporation acquires another foreign corporation exceeding a certain threshold value, and the foreign acquiring corporation is not tax resident in the\nforeign country in which the acquired foreign corporation was tax resident prior to the transactions, then the foreign acquiring corporation will be treated\nas a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (clauses (i) and (ii), the \u201cThird Country Rule\u201d). The Section 7874 Regulations further\nprovide for a number of special rules that aggregate multiple acquisitions of U.S. corporations or U.S. partnerships for purposes of Section 7874 of the\nCode as part of a plan or conducted over a 36-month period. Moreover, certain acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period will impact the\nSection 7874 Percentage, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code will apply to a foreign acquiring corporation.\nBabylon will indirectly acquire substantially all of the assets of Alkuri through the Business Combination. Babylon does not expect the Third\nCountry Rule to be applicable to the Business Combination. As a result, Section 7874 of the Code may apply to cause Babylon to be treated as a U.S.\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Business Combination depending on whether the Section 7874 Percentage equals or\nexceeds 80%, subject to the applicability of the Substantial Business Activities Exception.\nBased upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code and the Section 7874\nRegulations, and certain factual assumptions, Alkuri and Babylon currently expect the Section 7874 Percentage of Alkuri Stockholders in Babylon to be\nless than 80% after the Business Combination. Accordingly, Babylon is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes under Section 7874 of the Code. The calculation of the Section 7874 Percentage is complex and is subject to detailed regulations (the application\nof which is uncertain in various respects and would be\n166\nTable of Contents\nimpacted by changes in such U.S. Treasury regulations with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. Whether the\nSection 7874 Percentage is less than 80% must be finally determined after completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse\nchanges to the relevant facts and circumstances. Moreover, former Alkuri securityholders will be deemed to own an amount of Babylon Shares in respect\nto certain redemptions by Alkuri of Alkuri Common Stock prior to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the ownership percentage of\nformer Alkuri securityholders for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. As a result, no opinion of counsel has or will be provided regarding the\napplication of Section 7874 to the Business Combination. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of Babylon as\na foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code or that such challenge would not be sustained by a court.\nIf the IRS were to successfully challenge under Section 7874 of the Code Babylon\u2019s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, Babylon and certain Babylon shareholders would be subject to significant adverse tax consequences, including a higher effective corporate\nincome tax rate on Babylon and future withholding taxes on certain Babylon shareholders, depending on the application of any income tax treaty that\nmight apply to reduce such withholding taxes.\nHowever, even if the Section 7874 Percentage was such that Babylon were still respected as a foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code,\nBabylon may be limited in using its equity to engage in future acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period following the Business\nCombination. If Babylon were to be treated as acquiring substantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation within a 36-month period after the Business\nCombination, the Section 7874 Regulations would exclude certain shares of Babylon attributable to the Business Combination for purposes of\ndetermining the Section 7874 Percentage of that subsequent acquisition, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code would apply to such\nsubsequent acquisition.\nThe remainder of this discussion assumes that Babylon will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section\n7874 of the Code.\nUtilization of Alkuri\u2019s Tax Attributes and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to Babylon and Babylon\u2019s Shareholders.\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S.\ncorporation and its U.S. affiliates to use U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. taxable income resulting\nfrom certain transactions, as well as result in certain other adverse tax consequences, even if the acquiring foreign corporation is respected as a foreign\ncorporation for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. Specifically, Section 7874 of the Code can apply in this manner if (i) the foreign corporation\nacquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation, (ii) after the acquisition, the former\nshareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least 60% (by either vote or value) but less than 80% (by vote and value) of the shares of the\nforeign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the acquired U.S. corporation, (iii) the Third Country Rule does not apply, and (iv) the\nforeign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not meet the Substantial Business Activities Exception.\nBased upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code and the Section 7874\nRegulations, and certain factual assumptions, Alkuri and Babylon currently expect that the Section 7874 Percentage should be less than 60% after the\nBusiness Combination. Accordingly, the limitations and other rules described above are not expected to apply to Babylon or Alkuri after the Business\nCombination.\nIf the Section 7874 Percentage applicable to the Business Combination is at least 60% but less than 80% and the Third Country Rule does not apply\n(as expected), Babylon and certain of Babylon\u2019s shareholders may be subject to adverse tax consequences including, but not limited to, restrictions on\nthe use of tax attributes with respect to \u201cinversion gain\u201d recognized over a 10-year period following the transaction, disqualification of\n167\nTable of Contents\ndividends paid from preferential \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d rates and the requirement that any U.S. corporation owned by Babylon include as \u201cbase\nerosion payments\u201d that may be subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax any amounts treated as reductions in gross income paid to certain related\nforeign persons. Furthermore, certain \u201cdisqualified individuals\u201d (including officers and directors of a U.S. corporation) may be subject to an excise tax on\ncertain stock-based compensation held thereby at a rate of 20%. However, as a blank check company whose assets are primarily comprised of cash and\ncash equivalents, it is not expected that Alkuri will have a significant amount of inversion gain as a result of the Business Combination.\nThe above determination, however, is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects and would be\nimpacted by future changes in such U.S. Treasury regulations, with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. Whether the\nSection 7874 Percentage is less than 60% must be finally determined after completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse\nchanges to the relevant facts and circumstances. As a result, no opinion of counsel has or will be provided regarding the application of Section 7874 to\nthe Business Combination. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge whether Babylon is subject to the above rules or that\nsuch a challenge would not be sustained by a court. If the IRS successfully applied these rules to Babylon, significant adverse tax consequences could\nresult for Babylon and for certain Babylon shareholders, including a higher effective corporate tax rate on Babylon.\nU.S. HOLDERS\nAs used herein, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of an Alkuri Security, Babylon Class A Share, and/or Babylon Warrants, as the case may be,\nwho or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as\ncreated or organized) in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust if (1) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons have\nthe authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a United States person.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders\nTax Consequences of the Business Combination\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination will depend primarily upon whether the Business Combination qualifies as\na tax-deferred \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which is not currently expected to be the case.\nFor the Business Combination to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, Babylon must, either directly or\nindirectly through certain controlled entities, either continue a significant line of Alkuri\u2019s historic business or use a significant portion of Alkuri\u2019s historic\nbusiness assets in a business, in each case, within the meaning of Treasury regulations Section 1.368-1(d). In addition, in order for the Business\nCombination to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, it generally must satisfy the requirements under either\nSection 368(a)(1)(B) or Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code. In order for the Business Combination to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(B) or\nSection 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, it is necessary that a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in Alkuri be preserved in the Business\nCombination and, in order for the Business Combination to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, it is necessary that Alkuri\nhold \u201csubstantially all\u201d of its properties following the Business Combination. Sufficiently substantial levels of redemptions would be expected to cause\nthe Business Combination not to satisfy some or all of the applicable requirements.\n168\nTable of Contents\nDue to the high level of redemptions occurring in the market with respect to business combinations involving other special purpose acquisition\ncompanies and the risk that similar levels of redemptions could occur in connection with the Business Combination, the Business Combination is not\nexpected to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction, including as a \u201creorganization\u201d under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that is the\ncase, a U.S. Holder of Alkuri Securities generally will recognize gain or loss with respect to its Alkuri Securities in an amount equal to the difference, if\nany, between the fair market value of the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants received in the Business Combination and the U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in its Alkuri Securities surrendered. Such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss provided that a U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period\nfor Alkuri Securities is more than one year at the date of the Business Combination. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Alkuri\npublic shares have suspended the applicable holding period for this purpose. Long-term capital gains recognized by U.S. Holders that are not\ncorporations generally are eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. A U.S.\nHolder should have a tax basis in the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants received equal to the fair market value on the date of the\nexchange, and the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to such Babylon Class A Shares should begin on the day after the Business Combination.\nU.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Alkuri Securities (generally, Alkuri Securities purchased or acquired on different dates or at different\nprices) or who hold both Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants will generally be required to calculate gain or loss separately for each block of Alkuri\nSecurities and with respect to Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants. Such U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine how the\nabove rules apply to them, and the discussion above does not specifically address all of the consequences to U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of\nAlkuri Securities.\nIf, contrary to the discussion above, the level of redemptions occurring in connection with the Business Combination were low enough and the\nother applicable requirements (including the other requirements discussed above) were met, and the Business Combination were to qualify as a\n\u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, subject to additional requirements under Section 367(a) of the Code being satisfied\n(including, for U.S. Holders that are \u201cfive-percent transferee shareholder\u201d of the transferee non-U.S. corporation, as defined in the Treasury regulations,\nthat they enter into a \u201cgain recognition agreement\u201d), U.S. Holders of Alkuri Securities generally would not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes in connection with the Business Combination. In that case, a U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants\nreceived in the Business Combination would generally equal the U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in the exchanged Alkuri Securities, and the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding\nperiod for the Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants received in the Business Combination would generally include the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding\nperiod in the surrendered Alkuri Securities. Special considerations could apply to U.S. Holders who participated in the redemption but also exchanged\nAlkuri Securities pursuant to the Business Combination.\nNo ruling has been requested, nor is one intended to be requested, from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business\nCombination. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination is subject to both legal and factual uncertainty, is not free from doubt,\nand may change depending on the actual level of redemptions that occur in connection with the Business Combination. No opinion of counsel has or will\nbe provided regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not\nassert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to that described above. Accordingly, each U.S. Holder of Alkuri Securities is urged to\nconsult its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequence of the Business Combination to such U.S. Holder.\nTax Effects to U.S. Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights\nCharacterization of Redemptions\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder of Alkuri Common Stock that exercises its redemption rights with respect to its Alkuri\nCommon Stock to receive cash in exchange for all or a portion of its Alkuri Common Stock will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of\nAlkuri Common Stock under Section 302 of the Code or is treated as a distribution under Section 301 of the Code.\n169\nTable of Contents\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock by a U.S. Holder, the tax consequences to such U.S. Holder are as described below\nunder the section entitled \u201c \u2014Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Alkuri Common Stock.\u201d If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of Alkuri\nCommon Stock, a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences to such U.S. Holder as described\nbelow under the section entitled \u201c\u2014Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution.\u201d\nWhether a redemption of Alkuri Common Stock qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of Alkuri Common Stock treated\nas held by the redeemed U.S. Holder before and after the redemption (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. Holder, as a result of owning\nAlkuri Warrants or due to the ownership of Alkuri Common Stock by certain related individuals or entities in which such U.S. Holder has an interest or\nthat have an interest in such U.S. Holder) relative to all Alkuri Common Stock outstanding both before and after the redemption. The redemption of Alkuri\nCommon Stock generally will be treated as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (1) is \u201csubstantially\ndisproportionate\u201d with respect to the U.S. Holder, (2) results in a \u201ccomplete termination\u201d of the U.S. Holder\u2019s interest in Alkuri, or (3) is \u201cnot essentially\nequivalent to a dividend\u201d with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\nIn determining whether any of the foregoing tests result in a redemption qualifying for sale treatment, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only\nAlkuri Common Stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also Alkuri Common Stock that are constructively owned by it under certain attribution\nrules set forth in the Code. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and\nentities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any stock that the holder has a right to acquire by\nexercise of an option, which would generally include Alkuri Common Stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of Alkuri Warrants.\nIn order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of Alkuri\u2019s outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by\nthe U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock must, among other requirements, be less than eighty percent (80%) of the\npercentage of Alkuri\u2019s outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption (taking into\naccount redemptions by other holders of Alkuri Common Stock). There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder\u2019s interest if either (1) all Alkuri\nCommon Stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (2) all Alkuri Common Stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder are\nredeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by certain\nfamily members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other Alkuri Common Stock (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S.\nHolder as a result of owning Alkuri Warrants). The redemption of Alkuri Common Stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if the redemption\nresults in a \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d of the U.S. Holder\u2019s proportionate interest in Alkuri. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a\nU.S. Holder\u2019s proportionate interest in Alkuri will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling\nthat even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation where such stockholder exercises\nno control over corporate affairs may constitute such a \u201cmeaningful reduction.\u201d\nIf none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock generally will be treated as a corporate distribution to the\nredeemed U.S. Holder and the tax effects to such a U.S. Holder generally will be as described below under the section entitled \u201c \u2014Taxation of\nRedemption Treated as a Distribution.\u201d After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed Alkuri Common\nStock will be added to the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its remaining Alkuri Common Stock, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis\nin its Alkuri Warrants or possibly in other Alkuri Common Stock constructively owned by it.\n170\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution\nIf the redemption of a U.S. Holder\u2019s shares of Alkuri Common Stock is treated as a corporate distribution, as discussed above under the section\nentitled \u201c \u2014Characterization of Redemptions,\u201d the amount of cash received in the redemption generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes to the extent paid from Alkuri\u2019s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.\nDistributions in excess of Alkuri\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits generally will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against\nand reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Alkuri Common Stock. Any remaining excess generally will be treated\nas gain realized on the sale of Alkuri Common Stock, treated as described below under the section entitled \u201c \u2014Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale\nof Alkuri Common Stock.\u201d\nTaxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Alkuri Common Stock\nIf the redemption of a U.S. Holder\u2019s Alkuri Common Stock is treated as a sale, as discussed above under the section entitled \u201c\u2014Characterization\nof Redemptions,\u201d a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in\nthe redemption and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the Alkuri Common Stock redeemed. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for the Alkuri Common Stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains recognized\nby non-corporate U.S. Holders generally will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nU.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Alkuri Common Stock (including as a result of holding different blocks of Alkuri Common Stock\npurchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to them.\nU.S. Holders who actually or constructively own at least five percent (5%) (or, if Alkuri Common Stock is not then publicly traded, at least one\npercent (1%)) or more of Alkuri Common Stock may be subject to special reporting requirements with respect to a redemption of Alkuri Common Stock,\nand such Holders should consult with their tax advisors with respect to their reporting requirements.\nTax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants\nDividends and Other Distributions on Babylon Class A Shares\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below under the heading \u201c\u2014Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,\u201d distributions (including, for the\navoidance of doubt and for the purpose of the balance of this discussion, deemed distributions) on Babylon Class A Shares will generally be taxable as a\ndividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from Babylon\u2019s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S.\nfederal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of Babylon\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will\nbe applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Babylon Class A Shares. Any remaining excess will be\ntreated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Babylon Class A Shares and will be treated as described below under the heading \u201c\u2014Gain\nor Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants.\u201d If Babylon does not provide\ncalculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. Holder should expect all cash distributions to be reported as\ndividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of any such distribution will include any amounts withheld by Babylon (or another applicable\nwithholding agent). Amounts treated as dividends that Babylon pays to a U.S. Holder that is a taxable corporation generally will be taxed at regular tax\nrates and will not qualify for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other\ndomestic corporations. With respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, under tax laws currently in effect and subject to certain exceptions (including, but not\nlimited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment\n171\nTable of Contents\ninterest deduction limitations), dividends generally will be taxed at the lower applicable long-term capital gains rate only if Babylon Class A Shares are\nreadily tradable on an established securities market in the United States or Babylon is eligible for benefits under an applicable tax treaty with the United\nStates, and, in each case, Babylon is not treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder at the time the dividend was paid or in the preceding year and\nprovided certain holding period requirements are met. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower rate for\ndividends paid with respect to Babylon Class A Shares.\nThe amount of any dividend distribution paid in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the applicable exchange\nrate in effect on the date of actual or constructive receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S.\nHolder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.\nAmounts taxable as dividends generally will be treated as income from sources outside the U.S. and will, depending on the circumstances of the\nU.S. Holder, be \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d category income which, in either case, is treated separately from other types of income for purposes of computing\nthe foreign tax credit allowable to such U.S. Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) Babylon is 50% or more owned, by vote or value, by U.S.\npersons and (b) at least 10% of Babylon\u2019s earnings and profits are attributable to sources within the United States, then for foreign tax credit purposes, a\nportion of Babylon\u2019s dividends would be treated as derived from sources within the United States. In such case, with respect to any dividend paid for\nany taxable year, the U.S.-source ratio of such dividends for foreign tax credit purposes would be equal to the portion of Babylon\u2019s earnings and profits\nfrom sources within the United States for such taxable year, divided by the total amount of Babylon\u2019s earnings and profits for such taxable year.\nGain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below under the heading \u201c\u2014Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,\u201d upon any sale, exchange or other\ntaxable disposition of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the\ndifference between (i) the sum of (x) the amount cash and (y) the fair market value of any other property, received in such sale, exchange or other taxable\ndisposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such Babylon Class A Share or Babylon Warrant (determined as described above or below), in\neach case as calculated in U.S. dollars. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s holding period for such Babylon Class A Share or Babylon Warrant exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S.\nHolder generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nExercise, Lapse or Redemption of Babylon Warrants\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant, a U.S. Holder\ngenerally will not recognize taxable gain or loss on the exercise of a Babylon Warrant. The U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the Babylon Class A Share received\nupon exercise of a Babylon Warrant generally will be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. Holder\u2019s initial investment in the Alkuri Warrant in respect of\nwhich the exercised Babylon Warrant was received (assuming the Business Combination is not a taxable transaction under Section 368(a) of the Code,\nSection 7874 of the Code, or Section 367 of the Code, as discussed above) and the exercise price of such Babylon Warrant. It is unclear whether the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s holding period for the Babylon Class A Shares received upon exercise of the Babylon Warrants will begin on the date following the date of\nexercise or on the date of exercise of the Babylon Warrants\u037e in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder\nheld the Babylon Warrants. If a Babylon Warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such U.S.\nHolder\u2019s tax basis in the Babylon Warrant.\n172\nTable of Contents\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant are not clear under current tax law. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a\ncashless exercise may be tax-deferred, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S.\nfederal income tax\npurposes. In either tax-deferred situation, a U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in the Babylon Class A Shares received generally should equal the U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in\nthe Babylon Warrants exercised therefor. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event (and not a recapitalization), it is unclear\nwhether a U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in the Babylon Class A Shares would be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise or on\nthe date of exercise of the Babylon Warrant\u037e in either case, the holding period would not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the\nBabylon Warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Babylon Class A Shares would include the holding\nperiod of the Babylon Warrants exercised therefor.\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a\nU.S. Holder could be deemed to have surrendered Babylon Warrants with an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of\nBabylon Warrants to be exercised. The U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value\nof the Babylon Warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such Babylon Warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in\nthe Babylon Class A Shares received would equal the sum of the U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the Babylon Warrants exercised and the exercise price of such\nBabylon Warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for Babylon Class A Shares would commence on the date following the date of\nexercise or on the date of exercise of the Babylon Warrants\u037e in either case, the holding period would not include the period during which the U.S. Holder\nheld the Babylon Warrants. Due to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, including when a U.S.\nHolder\u2019s holding period would commence with respect to the Babylon Class A Shares received, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative\ntax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.\nIf Babylon redeems Babylon Warrants for cash pursuant to the redemption provisions described in the section entitled \u201cDescription of Babylon\nWarrants\u201d or if we purchase Babylon Warrants in an open market transaction, such redemption or purchase generally will be treated as a taxable\ndisposition to the U.S. Holder, taxed as described above under \u201c\u2014Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon\nClass A Shares and Babylon Warrants.\u201d\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the Babylon Warrant\nare unclear under current law. Such cashless exercise may be treated either as if we redeemed such Babylon Warrant for Babylon Class A Shares or as an\nexercise of the Babylon Warrant. If the cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant for Babylon Class A Shares is treated as a redemption, then such\nredemption generally should be treated as a tax-deferred recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case a U.S. Holder should not\nrecognize any gain or loss on such redemption, and accordingly, a U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in the Babylon Class A Shares received should equal the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s basis in the Babylon Warrant and the holding period of the Babylon Class A Shares would include the holding period of the Babylon Warrant. If\nthe cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant is treated as such, the tax consequences generally should be as described under the heading \u201c\u2014U.S Federal\nIncome Taxation of U.S. Holders-Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Babylon Warrant.\u201d Due to the lack of clarity under current law regarding the\ntreatment of a cashless exercise of a Babylon Warrant after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the Babylon Warrant, there can be no assurance as\nto which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the exercise of a Babylon Warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem\nthe Babylon Warrant as described above.\n173\nTable of Contents\nPossible Constructive Distributions\nThe terms of each Babylon Warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Babylon Class A Shares for which the Babylon Warrant may be\nexercised or to the exercise price of the Babylon Warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled\n\u201cDescription of Babylon Warrants.\u201d An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the Babylon\nWarrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment to the number of such Babylon Class\nA Shares received upon exercise of the Babylon Warrants or to the exercise price of the Babylon Warrants increases the proportionate interest of the U.S.\nHolder of Babylon Warrants in Babylon\u2019s assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of Babylon Class A Shares that would be\nobtained upon exercise or through a decrease in the exercise price of a Babylon Warrant) as a result of a distribution (or a transaction treated as a\ndistribution) of cash or other property, such as other securities, to the holders of Babylon Class A Shares, which is taxable to the holders of such shares\nas a distribution. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the Babylon Warrants received a\ncash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nThe treatment of U.S. Holders of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants could be materially different from that described above if Babylon\nis treated as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income in a\ntaxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is\npassive income or (ii) at least 50% of its assets, in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year),\nincluding its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, are held for the\nproduction of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than\nrents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets. PFIC status is determined\nannually and depends on the composition of a company\u2019s income and assets and the fair market value of its assets and no assurance can be given as to\nwhether Babylon will be a PFIC in 2021 or for any future taxable year, in particular because Babylon\u2019s PFIC status for any taxable year will generally be\ndetermined in part by reference to the value of Babylon\u2019s assets and Babylon\u2019s revenues. Based on the current and anticipated composition of the\nincome, assets and operations of Babylon and its subsidiaries and certain factual assumptions, Babylon does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for\n2021. Because Babylon\u2019s PFIC status relies on a number of factual determinations, our U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to Babylon\u2019s PFIC\nstatus for 2021 or future taxable years.\nAlthough Babylon\u2019s PFIC status is determined annually, Babylon will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC in subsequent years in the case of\na U.S. Holder who held Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants while Babylon was a PFIC, whether or not Babylon meets the test for PFIC status in\nthose subsequent years. If Babylon is determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S.\nHolder of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants and, in the case of Babylon Class A Shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either an applicable\nPFIC election (or elections), as further described below, for the first taxable year of Babylon in which it was treated as a PFIC and in which the U.S. Holder\nheld (or was deemed to hold) such Babylon Class A Shares or otherwise, such U.S. Holder generally will be subject to special and adverse rules with\nrespect to (i) any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants (which may\ninclude gain realized by reason of transfers of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Warrants that would otherwise qualify as nonrecognition transactions\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes) and (ii) any \u201cexcess distribution\u201d made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to\n174\nTable of Contents\nsuch U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in\nrespect of the Babylon Class A Shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for\nthe Babylon Class A Shares).\nUnder these rules:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for the Babylon Class A Shares\nor Babylon Warrants\u037e\n\u2022\nthe amount allocated to the U.S. Holder\u2019s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to\nthe period in the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period before the first day of Babylon\u2019s first taxable year in which Babylon is a PFIC, will be taxed as\nordinary income\u037e\n\u2022\nthe amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the\nhighest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder without regard to the U.S. Holder\u2019s other items of income and loss\nfor such year\u037e and\n\u2022\nan additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to\nthe tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.\nIf Babylon is a PFIC and Babylon Class A Shares constitute \u201cmarketable stock,\u201d a U.S. Holder may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences\ndiscussed above if such U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for the first taxable year in which it holds (or is deemed\nto hold) Babylon Class A Shares and each subsequent taxable year. Such U.S. Holder generally will include for each of its taxable years as ordinary\nincome the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its Babylon Class A Shares at the end of such year over its adjusted basis in its Babylon Class A\nShares. These amounts of ordinary income would not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital\ngains. The U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted basis of its Babylon Class A Shares over the fair\nmarket value of its Babylon Class A Shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a\nresult of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder\u2019s basis in its Babylon Class A Shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts,\nand any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its Babylon Class A Shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-\nto-market election may not be made with respect to Babylon Warrants.\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for \u201cmarketable stock,\u201d generally, stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that\nis registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that\nthe market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. If made, a mark-to-market election would be effective for the taxable year for which\nthe election was made and for all subsequent taxable years unless the Babylon Class A Shares cease to qualify as \u201cmarketable stock\u201d for purposes of the\nPFIC rules or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax\nconsequences of a mark-to-market election with respect to Babylon Class A Shares under their particular circumstances.\nAlternatively, a U.S. Holder of a PFIC may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences described above in respect of stock of the PFIC (but not\nwarrants) by making and maintaining a timely and valid qualified electing fund (\u201cQEF\u201d) election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its pro rata share\nof the PFIC\u2019s net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current basis, in each case whether or\nnot distributed, in the first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which the PFIC\u2019s taxable year ends and each subsequent taxable year. In order\nto comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC Annual Information Statement from the PFIC. Babylon does not\npresently intend to provide a PFIC Annual Information Statement in order for U.S. Holders to make or maintain a QEF election. However, as described\nabove, Babylon does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for 2021.\n175\nTable of Contents\nSubsidiary PFICs\nIf Babylon is a PFIC and, at any time, has a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally would be deemed to own a\nproportionate amount of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if\nBabylon receives a distribution from, or disposes of all or part of its interest in, the lower-tier PFIC, or the U.S. Holder otherwise was deemed to have\ndisposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. There can be no assurance that Babylon will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier\nPFIC. A mark-to-market election generally would not be available with respect to such lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors\nregarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.\nPFIC Reporting Requirements\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621\n(whether mark-to-market or any other election is made) and to provide such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure\nto do so, if required, will extend the statute of limitations applicable to such U.S. Holder until after such required information is furnished to the IRS.\nThe rules governing PFICs and mark-to-market and other elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those\ndescribed above, including the application of the rules addressing overlaps in the PFIC rules and the Section 367 rules and the rules relating to controlled\nforeign corporations. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning\nthe application of the PFIC rules to Babylon securities under their particular circumstances.\nAdditional Reporting Requirements\nCertain U.S. Holders may be required to file an IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation) to report a transfer\nof property to Babylon. Substantial penalties may be imposed on a U.S. Holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement and the period of\nlimitations on assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply. In addition, certain U.S. Holders\n(and to the extent provided in IRS guidance, certain individual Non-U.S. Holders) holding specified foreign financial assets with an aggregate value in\nexcess of the applicable dollar thresholds are required to report information to the IRS relating to Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants,\nsubject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial\ninstitutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) with their tax return for each year in which they\nhold Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to file IRS Form 8938 and the period of limitations on\nassessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax\nadvisors regarding the effect, if any, of these rules on the ownership and disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries are subject\nto information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding generally will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder if (i) the U.S. Holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) the U.S.\nHolder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a holder will be allowed as a credit against\nsuch holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n176\nTable of Contents\nNON-U.S. HOLDERS\nAs used herein, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of an Alkuri Security, Babylon Class A Share or Babylon Warrant, as the case may be,\nwho or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\na non-resident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject to U.S. tax as expatriates\u037e\n\u2022\na foreign corporation\u037e or\n\u2022\nan estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.\nThe following describes U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the (i) Business Combination, (ii) exercise of redemption rights and (iii)\nownership and disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants by a Non-U.S. Holder after the Business Combination.\nEffects of the Business Combination to Non-U.S. Holders\nThe U.S. federal income tax characterization of the Business Combination to Non-U.S. Holder generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income\ntax characterization of the Business Combination to U.S. Holder, as described under \u201c\u2014U.S. Holders\u2014U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations of the\nBusiness Combination to U.S. Holders\u201d above, although to the extent the Business Combination results in a taxable exchange of Alkuri Common Stock or\nAlkuri Warrants, the consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder would be similar to those described below under the heading \u201c \u2014Tax Effects to Non-U.S.\nHolders of Exercising Redemption Rights\u2014Taxation of Redemptions Treated as a Sale or Exchange of Alkuri Common Stock\u201d for a Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s\ngain on the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock and a Non-U.S. Holder would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax only to the extent described\ntherein.\nTax Effects to Non-U.S. Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder of Alkuri Common Stock that exercises its redemption rights to receive cash from\nthe trust account in exchange for all or a portion of its Alkuri Common Stock will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Alkuri\nCommon Stock redeemed, as described above under \u201c \u2014U.S. Holders\u2014Tax Effects to U.S. Holders of Exercising Redemption Rights\u2014Characterization\nof Redemptions.\u201d If such a redemption qualifies as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Non-U.S. Holder will\nbe as described below under \u201c\u2014Taxation of Redemptions Treated as a Sale or Exchange of Alkuri Common Stock.\u201d If such a redemption does not\nqualify as a sale of Alkuri Common Stock, the Non-U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution, the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of which are described below under \u201c \u2014Taxation of Redemptions Treated as Distributions.\u201d\nTaxation of Redemptions Treated as a Sale or Exchange of Alkuri Common Stock.\nSubject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, if such a redemption qualifies as a sale of shares of Alkuri Common Stock, Non-\nU.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the redemption of Alkuri Common Stock,\nunless either:\n(i)\nthe gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, and, if provided in an\napplicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d or a \u201cfixed base\u201d maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the\nUnited States\u037e or\n(ii)\nthe Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is treated as present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and\ncertain other conditions are met, in which case such gain (which gain may be offset by certain U.S.-source losses) generally will be taxed at\na 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate).\nA Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the\nredemption generally in the same manner as discussed in the section above\n177\nTable of Contents\nunder \u201c\u2014U.S. Holders\u2014Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants\u2014Gain or\nLoss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants,\u201d unless an applicable income tax\ntreaty provides otherwise. In addition, earnings and profits of a corporate Non-U.S. Holder that are attributable to such gain, as determined after\nallowance for certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an\napplicable income tax treaty.\nTaxation of Redemptions Treated as Distributions.\nSubject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, if a Non-U.S. Holder receives cash for Alkuri Common Stock in a redemption that\nis treated as a distribution from Alkuri on Alkuri Common Stock, the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax (unless otherwise\nreduced by an applicable income tax treaty) to the extent the distribution is paid from current or accumulated earnings and profits of Alkuri, as determined\nunder U.S. federal income tax principles.\nHowever, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the income from such distribution is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of\nthe Non-U.S. Holder in the United States and, if provided under an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or a \u201cfixed\nbase\u201d maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to regular federal income tax on such distribution\ngenerally in the same manner as discussed in the section above under \u201c\u2014U.S. Holders \u2014Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders of Ownership and\nDisposition of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Warrants\u2014Dividends and Other Distributions on Babylon Class A Shares,\u201d unless an applicable\nincome tax treaty provides otherwise.

        "Section Header": "ALKURI\u2019S BUSINESS",
        "Section Text": "ALKURI\u2019S BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nAlkuri was incorporated on December 1, 2020 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,\nrecapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Alkuri\u2019s efforts to identify a prospective\ntarget business were not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although it initially focused its search for target businesses on\ncompanies operating in the technology industry. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, Alkuri\u2019s efforts were limited to organizational activities,\ncompletion of its initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations.\nInitial Public Offering and Simultaneous Private Placement\nOn February 9, 2021, Alkuri closed the Alkuri IPO of 34,500,000 Alkuri units (after taking into account the full exercise of the over-allotment option\nby Alkuri\u2019s underwriters), with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable Alkuri Warrant, with\neach whole Alkuri Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share commencing 30 days\nafter the consummation of an initial business combination.\nFair Market Value of Target Business\nThe target business that Alkuri acquires must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust\naccount (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive\nagreement for its initial business combination, although Alkuri may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the\ntrust account balance. Alkuri\u2019s board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Babylon\nHoldings as described in the section entitled \u201cProposal One\u2014The Business Combination Proposal\u2014Satisfaction of 80% Test\u201d above.\nStockholder Approval of Business Combination\nUnder the SPAC Charter, Alkuri must seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which\npublic stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri public shares converted into cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed\nbusiness combination or do not vote at all, subject to the limitations described in the prospectus for the Alkuri IPO. Accordingly, in connection with the\nBusiness Combination, the Alkuri public stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri Common Stock converted to cash in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. See \u201cSpecial Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders\u2014Conversion Rights.\u201d\nVoting in Connection with the Stockholder Meeting\nIn connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, including the vote with respect to the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri\nStockholders prior to the Alkuri IPO and its officers and directors have each agreed to vote their Alkuri Common Stock in favor of such proposed\nBusiness Combination.\nAt any time prior to the special meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding Alkuri or its\nsecurities, the Alkuri initial stockholders, its officers and directors, Babylon shareholders and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares from\ninstitutional and other investors who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, or execute agreements to\npurchase such shares from them in the future, or they may enter into transactions with such persons and others to provide them with incentives to\nacquire Alkuri Common Stock or vote their shares in favor of the Business\n183Table of Contents\nCombination Proposal. The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirement\nthat the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting to approve the Business Combination Proposal vote in its favor and that\nthe conditions to the Closing of the Business Combination otherwise will be met, where it appears that such requirements or conditions would otherwise\nnot be met. While the exact nature of any such incentives has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, they might include,\nwithout limitation, include arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put\noptions and the transfer to such investors or holders of shares for nominal value.\nEntering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on the shares of Alkuri Common Stock. For example, as a result of these\narrangements, an investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to\nsell the shares he owns, either prior to or immediately after the special meeting.\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combination to be approved in circumstances where such\napproval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the\napproval of the Business Combination Proposal and the other proposals to be presented at the special meeting and would likely increase the chances that\nsuch proposals would be approved. Moreover, any such purchases may make it more likely that the conditions to the Closing of the Business\nCombination are met.\nNo agreements dealing with the above arrangements or purchases have been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. Alkuri\nwill file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose any arrangements entered into or significant purchases made by any of the aforementioned persons that\nwould affect the vote on the Business Combination Proposal or the satisfaction of any closing conditions. Any such report will include descriptions of\nany arrangements entered into or significant purchases by any of the aforementioned persons.\nLiquidation if No Business Combination\nUnder the SPAC Charter, if Alkuri does not complete the Business Combination with Babylon or another initial business combination by February\n9, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by Alkuri Stockholders in an amendment to the SPAC Charter), Alkuri will (i) cease all operations except for\nthe purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding\nAlkuri public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of Alkuri\u2019s remaining stockholders\nand its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to Alkuri\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for\nclaims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the Alkuri Warrants will expire. Holders of warrants will receive nothing\nupon a liquidation and the warrants will be worthless.\nEach of the initial stockholders of Alkuri and its officers and directors has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any distribution from Alkuri\u2019s\ntrust account or other assets with respect to the shares held by them prior to the Alkuri IPO. There will be no distribution from the trust account with\nrespect to Alkuri\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless if Alkuri is liquidated.\nThe proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of Alkuri\u2019s creditors which would be prior to the claims\nof the Alkuri public stockholders. Although Alkuri has obtained waiver agreements from certain vendors and service providers it has engaged and owes\nmoney to, and the prospective target businesses Alkuri has negotiated with, whereby such parties have waived any right, title, interest or claim of any\nkind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, and although Alkuri will seek such waivers from vendors it engages in the future, there\nis no guarantee that they or other vendors who did not execute such waivers will not seek recourse against the trust account notwithstanding such\nagreements. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable under certain circumstances to pay debts and obligations to target\n184\nTable of Contents\nbusinesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by Alkuri for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to it, but Alkuri cannot\nensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally there are two exceptions to the\nSponsor\u2019s indemnity: the Sponsor will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has\nexecuted an agreement with Alkuri waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2)\nas to any claims under the indemnity with the underwriters of the Alkuri IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.\nMoreover, the Sponsor will not be liable to the Alkuri public stockholders and instead will only have liability to Alkuri. Furthermore, the Sponsor may not\nbe able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to as the Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of Alkuri and Alkuri has not taken any\nfurther steps to ensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Accordingly, the actual per-share redemption\nprice could be less than approximately $10.00, plus interest, due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an\ninvoluntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy\nlaw, and may be included in Alkuri\u2019s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of Alkuri Stockholders. To\nthe extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, Alkuri cannot assure you it will be able to return to the Alkuri public stockholders at least\napproximately $10.00 per share. Alkuri\u2019s public stockholders are entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of its failure to complete\na business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders properly seek to have Alkuri redeem their respective shares for cash upon a\nbusiness combination which is actually completed by Alkuri. In no other circumstances does a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in\nthe trust account.\nIf Alkuri is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it which is not dismissed, any distributions received\nby stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor, creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent\nconveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by Alkuri Stockholders. Because Alkuri intends to distribute the\nproceeds held in the trust account to its public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time period to complete a business combination, this may\nbe viewed or interpreted as giving preference to its public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from its\nassets. Furthermore, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, Alkuri\u2019s board of directors may be\nviewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to Alkuri\u2019s creditors and/or may be viewed as having acted in bad faith, which may subject Alkuri and\nAlkuri to claims of punitive damages. Alkuri cannot assure you that such claims will not be brought against it.\nAlkuri will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from its remaining assets outside of the trust account plus the up to $100,000 of interest\nearned on the funds in the trust account that Alkuri may use for liquidation and dissolution expenses.\nEmployees\nAlkuri has two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to Alkuri\u2019s matters and intend to\ndevote only as much time as they deem necessary to its affairs. Alkuri does not intend to have any full time employees prior to the Closing.\nFacilities\nUpon the Closing, the principal executive offices of Alkuri will be those of Babylon.\n185\nTable of Contents\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nAlkuri\u2019s current directors and executive officers are as follows:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nSultan Almaadeed\n31\nChairman\nRichard Williams\n46\nChief Executive Officer\nSteve Krenzer\n62\nChief Financial Officer\nStephen Smith\n50\nDirector\nJason Harinstein\n45\nDirector\nKatie May\n53\nDirector\nSultan Almaadeed, Chairman\nMr. Almaadeed is the Founder and CEO of ENVST, a technology-enabled investment platform that allows individuals to strengthen their networks\nwithin the global investing ecosystem as well as source and participate in attractive investment opportunities.

        "Section Text": "BABYLON\u2019S BUSINESS\nIn this section, all references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to the business of Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries prior to the\nBusiness Combination, and may also include the professional corporations and limited liability companies that have an exclusive management\nservices arrangement with a Babylon Holdings entity, and that deliver professional healthcare services to members via its network of employed or\ncontract providers.\nOverview\nWe are a leading digital-first, value-based care company. Founded in 2013, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable\nfor everyone on Earth. We believe we are poised to reengineer the global healthcare market to better align system-wide incentives and to shift the focus\nfrom reactive sick care to preventative healthcare, resulting in better member health, improved member experience and reduced costs. To achieve this goal,\nwe are leveraging our highly scalable, digital-first platform combined with high quality clinical operations and affiliated provider networks to provide an\nintegrated, end-to-end healthcare solution.\nWe believe the growing $10 trillion global healthcare market, which is expected to continue to grow over the coming decades, has been unable to\nbalance the need for accessibility, quality and affordability. These challenges, facing healthcare systems in both developed and developing markets, have\nnot been properly addressed by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which is often country or even region specific. While this is generally\nreferred to as \u201chealth care\u201d, we consider it \u201csick care,\u201d as we believe the traditional fee-for-service (\u201cFFS\u201d) model is designed to focus on treating patients\nwhen they are sick rather than helping them stay healthy. In an effort to address resource scarcity, new healthcare technologies have begun to emerge\u037e\nhowever, we believe that existing digital tools, including telemedicine, are simply shifting the site of care but don\u2019t address the fundamental issues of\nwhen and how care is provided. The frustrations and limitations of \u201csick care\u201d are spurring a movement towards value-based care (\u201cVBC\u201d), which ties\nfinancial performance to medical outcomes. However, the VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale, given the upfront human capital and physical\ninfrastructure investment required with traditional care protocols.\nWe believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain by delivering a digital-first, integrated, end-to-end healthcare solution. Our core\nsolution, Babylon 360, couples our digital platform with a VBC approach, where we assume responsibility for the medical costs for a group of members in\nexchange for a fixed fee per member, aligning incentives to encourage better healthcare decision making while maintaining high clinical quality and\nexcellent member experience. Our digital-first approach enables our members to access the full spectrum of care services, from preventative care, to\nconsultation, to treatment, to rehabilitation and post-care, through our end-to-end digital platform. We believe that our integrated digital platform allows\nus to gather data and insights to continually improve our member experience and their care management. We work with our affiliated providers to take a\nproactive approach to members\u2019 health by actively engaging with members through our digital platform, clinical operations and provider networks to (i)\nprovide actionable insights and information about their wellbeing so that they can set their health goals, (ii) help our members to monitor their health on\nan ongoing basis, (iii) intervene early to provide the right care, medication and treatment, including by connecting patients with effective medical advice,\nincluding affiliated licensed physicians available 24/7, (iv) design a clear clinical care plan as needed for recovery and rehabilitation, and (v) transition\nrehabilitated patients from sick care to well care. For the approximately one-in-ten members that need in-person care, we leverage our existing network of\naffiliated medical professionals in conjunction with existing health plan provider networks and contracted physician networks to provide in-person care,\nreducing the need for our investment in resource- and capital- intensive infrastructure. In practice, this structure allows us to reduce the need for costly\nmember interactions with medical professionals, help prevent unnecessary acute or urgent care visits, and proactively manage chronic conditions.\nWith Babylon 360, our digital-first VBC solution, we partner with insurance companies, enterprises, governments, and provider networks to deliver\nour holistic care solution for a population of identified members.\n190Table of Contents\nIn exchange for providing end-to-end care, including preventative, acute, chronic and specialist services, for the member population, a monthly fee per\nmember, also referred to as a PMPM fee, is charged. Leveraging the power of our digital-first approach, we engage with these members to help keep them\nhealthy and avoid emergent visits to lower the overall cost of their care. In addition to Babylon 360, we also offer access to standalone services based on\nthe Babylon 360 digital platform, including (i) clinical services, where our affiliated providers deliver contracted medical consultations, and (ii) software\nlicensing through our Babylon Cloud Services offering, where we provide our digital solutions to customers that provide care through their own medical\nnetworks.\nAs of July 31, 2021, approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software offerings in 16 countries across Europe,\nNorth America, Asia, and Africa. We have scaled our VBC offering rapidly over the last year to become one of the largest VBC networks in the United\nStates, with over 100,000 VBC members as of July 31, 2021, and we expect to remain focused on U.S. growth. Across all of our geographies, results have\nbeen similar: our members gave us over 90% four- and five- star ratings in countries including in the United Kingdom (95%), the United States (98%) and\nRwanda (91%). Once a user has had a digital consultation with one of our clinicians, they have the ability to rate their experience between one and five\nstars, with five stars being the best and one star being the worst experience. The rating in the United Kingdom is measured from 2019 to present. The\nrating in the United States is measured from 2020 to present and includes rating from our virtual care and Babylon value-based care services. The rating in\nRwanda is measured from 2019 to 2020.\nWe also have received a 96% quality score from the NHS on NHS Quality Outcome Framework (\u201cQOF\u201d) in 2019 and 2020. QOF is the main set of\nquantitative measures used by NHS and the independent quality regulator for England to assess and reward high quality. We achieved 369.1 points out\nof 379 points, or 97%, for the clinical domain, 93.5 points out of 106 points, or 88%, for the public health domain and 74 points out of 74 points, or 100%,\nfor the Quality Indicator domain, receiving in total 536.6 points out of 559 points, or 96%. Additionally, according to a peer reviewed study commissioned\nby Babylon Holdings and published in Journal of Medical Internet Research, we have delivered up to 35% acute care cost savings for our members\nduring the relevant period. The study compared spending per patient for Babylon GP at Hand to the regional average spending over a two-year period\nfrom April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 in North West London, where Babylon GP at Hand is based. Moreover, according to an NHS-commissioned report\npublished by Ipsos MORI, which looked at the use of emergency room visits by patients during each of the 12-month periods before and after joining\nBabylon GP at Hand, we have achieved 25% fewer emergency room visits among our members during the relevant period 1.\nWe establish VBC contracts either as digital-first from inception, or in certain circumstances we acquire non-digital VBC contracts and transition\nthese to our digital-first framework. As we shift current VBC member interactions into our digital-first framework, we believe that our member management\ncapabilities and our members\u2019 health outcomes will improve and our cost of care delivery will decrease. Additionally, we expect to be able to rapidly scale\nand responsibly care for our growing member base with minimal incremental physical and professional infrastructure. We are driving growth by\nexpanding our existing service with our current customers into their wider operations and markets, converting more of our customers to the holistic\nBabylon 360 solution, and attracting new customers to the Babylon platform.\nWe have experienced rapid revenue growth in the past year and increasing operational leverage, in particular as we expanded our VBC offerings.\nOur revenue was $79.3 million and $16.0 million, our cost of care delivery was $67.3 million and $19.8 million, our platform and application expenses were\n$48.7 million and $16.9 million, and our research and development expenses were $35.5 million and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. Our revenue was $128.8 million and $22.5 million, our cost of care delivery was $92.1 million and $18.8 million, our platform and\napplication expenses were $21.4 million and $12.9 million, and our research and development expenses were $17.2 million and $20.9 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 respectively. Our loss for the financial year was $188.0 million and $140.3 million, our EBITDA was $(165.0) million\nand $(143.2) million and our Adjusted EBITDA was\n1\nWhile we have demonstrated the cost savings and reduction of emergency visit in these sample studies, there is no guarantee we will be able to\nreplicate this in the future.\n191\nTable of Contents\n$(146.2) million and $(152.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our loss was $75.7 million and $90.8 million, our\nEBITDA was $(62.7) million and $(78.9) million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $(54.2) million and $(76.2) million for the six months ended June 30, 2021\nand 2020, respectively. For a description of how we calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and the limitations of these non-IFRS financial measures,\nsee \u201c\u2014Key Business and Financial Metrics\u2014 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\nThe Market: Key Challenges and Developments\nIn 2019, the global healthcare market was a $10 trillion industry, and it is expected to grow over the coming decades with the aging of the global\npopulation and the expansion of care around the world. However, we believe the global healthcare market remains beset by the following key issues that\nlimit capacity and effectiveness of care in both developed and developing markets.\n\u2022\nAccessibility. Access to healthcare services is still restricted for many individuals globally. According to the WHO, more than half of the world\u2019s\npopulation is unable to obtain access to essential health services even in countries with well-established healthcare systems. Accessibility is also\nan issue in developed markets \u2013 for example, many Americans have limited access to primary care, so they rely on emergency departments for acute\ncare. In 2018, there were an estimated 130 million emergency department (\u201cED\u201d) visits in the United States, representing an overall average of 40\nvisits per 100 persons, and 87 visits per 100 persons in African American populations. We believe inequities in access to health services exist not\njust between, but also within, countries, as national averages can mask low levels of health service coverage in disadvantaged population groups.\n\u2022\nAffordability. Affordability of healthcare is a problem in developed and developing markets at both a system-wide and individual level. At a macro\nlevel, expenditures on healthcare in G7 countries have increased by 37% on average in the last decade, without accompanying improvement in\nhealth outcomes, according to OECD data. Individuals also struggle with high healthcare costs: according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control,\napproximately 14% of Americans report problems paying medical bills. Further, unaffordability of healthcare begets inaccessibility \u2013 in a 2016 OECD\nstudy, over 22% of people in the United States reported skipping medical consultations due to cost, and 43% of low-income adults reported having\nunmet care needs due to cost.\n\u2022\nQuality. Consistent delivery of quality healthcare remains a challenge across geographies, and healthcare spend does not equate to improved\nhealth outcomes. According to a 2019 OECD study, while the United States spends more on healthcare as a share of its economy than any other\ncountry (16.9% of its GDP), it has lower life expectancy than the OECD country average. Further, in low- and middle- income countries, between 5.7\nand 8.4 million deaths each year (representing up to 15% of overall deaths in such countries) are attributed to poor quality care. The inadequacy of\ntraditional healthcare has not gone unnoticed by individuals, especially those of younger generations: according to a 2019 Accenture report, 32%\nof Gen Z respondents reported being \u201cdissatisfied\u201d and \u201cextremely dissatisfied\u201d with the effectiveness of treatment provided by traditional\nhealthcare services. Across age groups, the United States ranks low compared to other G-7 countries, with only a 30% satisfaction rating among\nhealthcare participants.\nEfforts to address the challenges have led to important innovations in the healthcare industry\u037e however, we believe they continue to have inherent\nlimitations.\n\u2022\nDigital Transformation of Healthcare. We believe that patients, payers and governments are aligning on the need for cost containment through\nthe adoption of digital solutions in the healthcare sector. Demand for and adoption of telemedicine solutions has generally been accelerated by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic as it has demonstrated its benefit and importance in reaching patients. According to McKinsey, COVID-19 has caused a\nmassive acceleration in use of telehealth. Consumer adoption has skyrocketed, from 11% of U.S. consumers using telehealth in 2019 to 76% of\nsurvey respondents in May 2020 interested in using telehealth going forward. In the post-COVID-19 world, we believe this trend will continue due\nto the inherent structural benefits of virtual delivery of healthcare, including convenience and efficiency. However, we believe that in an effort to\naddress resource scarcity, existing digital tools, including telemedicine\n192\nTable of Contents\nconsultations, are simply shifting the site of care, without addressing the fundamental issues of when and how care is provided.\n\u2022\nEmergence of New Payment Models. The challenges of accessibility, affordability and quality facing healthcare systems have not been properly\naddressed by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which we refer to as \u201csick care.\u201d Healthcare providers, paid on a FFS basis, are\nrewarded for a higher volume of care rather than successful patient outcomes. This compensation model inadvertently promotes expensive and\nmore frequent interventions and treatments, leading to higher costs for those responsible for healthcare spend (e.g., governments, employers,\nindividuals, etc.). This has resulted in a movement towards VBC, which realigns incentives for healthcare providers, rewarding them for improving\npatient outcomes rather than increasing the volume of the services they provide. However, the VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale, given\nthe upfront human capital and physical infrastructure investment required with traditional care protocols.\nThe Babylon Solution\nWe believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain to simultaneously balance accessibility, affordability and quality by implementing\nthe key attributes of digital health and value-based care.\n\u2022\nAccessibility. Our digital-first clinical platform makes information available to members so that they can monitor their health information on mobile\ndevices, delivering digital-first care in countries as varied as the United States and Rwanda. Our digital-first, 24/7 access to medical professionals\nreduces barriers to care and improves timeliness of medical interventions, delivering an interaction with a member every five seconds.\n\u2022\nAffordability. Our technology platform improves productivity and reduces administrative burdens on medical professionals through the\nreallocation of tasks from clinicians to lower cost personnel, and the automation of a significant portion of back-office tasks. Simultaneously, our\nholistic care provision model allows us to actively monitor the health of our members and to provide them with targeted preventative and primary\ncare when needed, reducing the need for expensive secondary and tertiary care. Together, our digital-first care model can dramatically reduce\nsystemic costs. For example, in the United Kingdom in our partnership with the NHS, we have demonstrated that our solution reduces acute care\ncosts by up to 35% among our members. For a description of the study done on our solution, see \u201cBabylon\u2019s Business\u2014Overview.\u201d In 2019, the\nhealthcare expenditure per capita was $4,653 in the United Kingdom and $11,072 in the United States.\n\u2022\nQuality. Our platform delivers standardized treatment protocols, administrative practices and technology and automation. This allows us and our\naffiliated healthcare providers to work from a standardized model of medical intervention, reduce variations in care, and deliver the same quality\nstandards to all members. We believe this allows us to provide a better member experience and a higher standard of care. The quality delivered by\nour system has been confirmed by our members and customers\u037e for example, in the United Kingdom, we received a 96% quality score from the NHS.\nBabylon 360, our flagship holistic solution, combines our cutting-edge technologies with human clinical expertise to provide managed care for our\nmembers across the care continuum. Our end-to-end care solution is facilitated through our digital health suite, virtual care, in-person medical care, and\npost-care offerings. Our platform empowers users, providers, payers and health systems to generate better health outcomes by addressing the entire care\ncontinuum. By providing more care to members when they are healthy and creating clear and accessible solutions when they are sick, we believe we can\navoid the significant expenses associated with late or avoidable hospital-based care. We believe our platform disrupts the current state of care delivery\nand aligns incentives for our members and customers and simultaneously lowers costs for all stakeholders.\n193\nTable of Contents\nWhen delivering Babylon 360, we and our affiliated providers are able to provide end-to-end care through the creation of a comprehensive, digital-\nfirst \u201ccare pyramid\u201d tailored to each member\u2019s specific needs and circumstances.\nEach member\u2019s care pyramid is built on a mobile-native, digital self-care foundation that leverages a comprehensive, longitudinal view of a\nmember\u2019s specific circumstances to provide a range of AI-driven tools to help members create a set of health goals and to track their progress and\nachievement. This is complemented by our personal health assistant, which is available to help members with their care needs and for non-clinical\nsupport via chat or direct human interaction. When direct care is needed, it is first provided through virtual clinical consultations, available on a 24/7\nbasis, linking members with a clinical professional to address their urgent or chronic needs. While most member needs can be addressed with our digital\nand virtual tools, when a member does require in-person care, they are seamlessly connected to the appropriate caregiver for an in-person consultation. If\na member\u2019s care needs are more specialized or complex, we offer connections to secondary and tertiary care partners who work with us to provide the full\nspectrum of sick care. Our aim, over time, is to shift more and more interactions with Babylon Holdings from the bottom of the pyramid to the top, as\nmembers become healthier and also, increasingly, are able to undertake self-care and self-monitoring.\n194\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our holistic care model is presented to the member in an intuitive and consumer-friendly way. We engage actively and frequently with\nmembers, providing the care they need at the point they need it, leveraging existing digital devices as the first point of call and utilizing in-person\nproviders where needed.\n\u2022\nWhen in good health, the tools provided through our Digital Health Suite can provide members with insights and information about their wellbeing.\nFor example, through Healthcheck, we offer an assessment to help our members understand their current health metrics and how they may change\nin the future. We can use some of the information from this tool to help risk stratify our member population. By understanding their specific\ninformation with Health Assessment, members are better able to set personalized health goals. Our Healthcheck tool then provides members a\nreport, including actionable items to help them achieve those health goals and to help them track their progress and health information.\n\u2022\nIf members get sick, the Digital Health Suite offers 24/7 access to Digital Triage tools including a Symptom Checker as well as a dedicated personal\ncare team, so members get the right information, care, medication, and treatment as soon as needed. Through our Symptom Checker, members\nanswer questions about their symptoms and are directed to possibly matching conditions responsive to the information entered and potential next\nsteps. A personal care team gives members a clear clinical Care Plan for treatment and recovery. Then, once the members are back on their feet, the\nCare Team goes back to helping members to monitor their health information.\n\u2022\nExtensive follow-up care is delivered by affiliated providers, including medication management, transitions to the appropriate type of care, and\nrehabilitation. We provide recommendations for follow-up self-care to improve overall member outcomes and ensure that members maintain their\nhealth in the best state possible.\nOur Product\nOur AI-powered platform allows Babylon to uniquely deliver affordable, accessible and quality care to millions of members around the world to\neffectively engage, assess, plan, monitor, treat and support our members, delivering meaningful benefits to our stakeholders.\nFor members, the journey with Babylon starts with engagement and understanding a total picture of our members\u2019 health needs. We use multiple\nchannels to reach out to our members, from emails to phone calls to in-person visits with community health workers, to encourage members to install the\nBabylon app on their smartphone (or USSD app on their feature phone for regions where smartphone penetration is weak). Once members have installed\nthe Babylon app, they may (subject to compliance with applicable rules) be continuously\n195\nTable of Contents\nengaged through multiple push-type notifications, emails and SMS which may prompt them to complete a health assessment and create a personalized\ncare treatment plan unique to their needs. The in-app health assessment, coupled with existing patient EHR data, patient provided data, wearable data and\nclinical data, allows for a convenient way to have a holistic profile of our members and to measure aspects of risk to our members.\nWhen feeling unwell or concerned about unusual symptoms, our members can instantly access our AI-powered symptom checker, which will\nprovide responsive and convenient information. Through our Symptom Checker, members answer questions about their symptoms and are directed to\npossibly matching conditions responsive to the information entered and potential next steps associated with such conditions. Information outcomes\nrange on a continuum from hydrating with water to seeking follow-up care with a clinician or an ER visit.\nIf a member would like to see a clinician, our app can facilitate a prompt booking for a primary care, behavioral health or specialist\u2019s synchronous\nappointment, in many cases on a 24/7/365 basis. In the United States, over 85% of appointments happen within 30 minutes of booking. However, many\nclinical needs do not require a synchronous face-to-face appointment. Simple tasks such as birth control or prescription renewals happen\nasynchronously. For example, a member fills in a questionnaire and a clinician reviews it at a later point in time where permissible\u037e this feature is currently\navailable in the United Kingdom, and we plan to make it available in the United States.\nFor clinicians, Babylon\u2019s platform enables more efficient workflows, thus saving valuable time and allowing clinicians to focus on what\u2019s really\nimportant \u2013 the members. Our custom-built, web-based Clinician Portal provides longitudinal data around members and allows clinicians to save time on\narranging lab tests, issuing prescriptions, scheduling follow up consultations and other frequent tasks through workflow automation. The workflow task-\nlist helps the back-office team manage the transitions of care between providers. Steps are automated using robotic process automation to reduce the\noperational overhead. For example, lab test results become available to the doctor via Clinician Portal and doctors get notified to review them.\nFuture product development\nWe believe that continuous data assessment is key to understanding patient risks and existing conditions, and that these are critical elements to\ncrafting care plans. Babylon has under development proprietary AI which will enable ongoing monitoring of member data which will automatically\nsuggest to clinicians and members relevant goals and actions, while keeping the clinician in the loop to lead to better health outcomes. Once developed,\nour systems will detect abnormalities during the course of this continuous data assessment, our team would be proactively alerted to intervene to\nevaluate and understand the root cause and respond via email, phone, or notifications.\nWe are aiming to further reduce the administrative burden for clinicians through the ongoing development of automated note taking and coding. A\nleading NLP engine is in development to auto-transcribe clinician interactions in real time and generate meaningful notes and summaries about\ninteractions. In addition, we are deeply focused on automatically coding our patient conditions to get the most accurate record of their care and\nconditions. We expect this to provide improved accountability and transparency with the goal of reducing costly errors and augmenting our data set to\nenable future AI solutions. Furthermore, we are very focused on coaching and enabling habit changes that lead to better health outcomes.\nThe features listed in this section are under active development and have not been commercialized as of the date of this prospectus. We cannot\nguarantee if or when the features will be available for use.\n196\nTable of Contents\nOur Strengths and Key Differentiators\nOur goal is to provide a full spectrum of care services through a comprehensive digital-first platform supported by an AI-powered, cloud-based,\nintegrated technology stack. Our key strengths and differentiators are:\n\u2022\nPurpose-Built, Tech-Enabled & AI-Powered. Our end-to-end healthcare platform is supported by AI, which we believe optimizes efficiency and\nimproves outcomes across the entire care management value chain, from risk stratification to triage to care management. This digital-first,\ntechnology-forward approach has been our strategy from the outset and is intrinsically built into our care delivery solutions, in contrast to other\ncare providers that have bolted technology capabilities onto a traditional care delivery model. We have heavily invested in our technology as well\nas in our team of highly experienced researchers, scientists and engineers since our founding in 2013, which we believe gives us a significant\nadvantage over other care providers and will continue to progress our capabilities. We are also able to license our technology to third parties. Our\nAI and automation reduce the human capital intensity of providing healthcare, while seeking to improve the quality of decision making and health\noutcomes, offering:\n\u2022\nEvidence-based insights, whole person care, and lifestyle and behavioral risk benchmarking for over 30 common diseases\u037e\n\u2022\nA cloud-based, integrated self-care and clinical services platform, which allows us to deliver convenient, continuous and scalable care\nglobally\u037e and\n\u2022\nIntegrated technology and virtual clinical operations, which automate low value tasks, allowing the focus to be on high value interactions\nand drive more efficiency than a normal physical primary care operation.\n\u2022\nProven & Highly-Scalable Care Delivery Model. Our digital-first model is highly scalable, which differentiates us from competitors as we are able\nto deliver fully-integrated, personalized healthcare and access across the entire care spectrum through mobile devices many individuals already\nown or access. This technology allows us to offer access to on-demand 24/7 care through our digital platform while leveraging existing, local\nhealthcare infrastructure in markets where our affiliated providers deliver care. This is evidenced by the rapid go-to-market in Missouri through our\npartnership with Home State Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene Corporation, where, within three months of reaching substantially final\nagreed terms, we leveraged our digital-first model and Centene\u2019s existing local healthcare network to provide our Babylon 360 solution to\napproximately 17,000 members, with limited incremental investment. We believe many traditional integrated care competitors, such as agilon health\nand Oak Street Health, are, at best, technology-enabled as opposed to digital-first. As a result, their businesses have shown less and slower\nrelative scalability due to a lack of end-to-end technology capabilities and use of a capital-intensive bricks-and-mortar-first model which we believe\nreduces their ability to expand to new markets and capture segment share beyond their near-term physical footprint. Additionally, because we are\nallocated a population of members under our VBC contracts, we are able to focus our outreach efforts on engagement with our allocated members.\n197\nTable of Contents\n(1)\nSourced from public filings unless otherwise stated.

Teladoc\u2019s FY20 Revenue was obtained from its pro forma financials for acquisitions. Babylon\u2019s\nfinancials were based on management estimates consistent with the forecasts provided to Alkuri. This high level of scalability does, however, require that we balance\nour growth against the management, operational and financial resources needed to enter new markets.\n\u2022\nProactively Delivering Mobile-Native Care to Members. Our digital-first platform allows us to deliver access to integrated, personalized healthcare\nat scale through our app on the devices most individuals already own. This enables us to quickly, efficiently and effectively interact with members\nto provide support and care, ideally preventing a member from becoming sick. Upon signing a new Babylon 360 contract, we quickly seek to make\ndirect contact with each member covered under that contract to offer a digital assessment. If required, we also offer to connect members to an\nintroductory video consultation with a clinician. Following initial contact with the member, we continue to provide proactive monitoring and\ncommunicate electronically through email and the Babylon app to drive member engagement. Our Care Teams proactively offer personalized\nhealthcare plans for high risk members involving higher levels of interaction with their personal Care Team. Medium risk members also get\npersonalized care plans with a lower number of interactions with the Care Team and a focus on healthy living coaching and education. Low-risk\nmembers are provided with resources for self-help and education about general wellness. This is automated profiling of an individual (as defined in\nUK privacy law) and this requires careful considerations as it involves health data.\n\u2022\nDeep Experience in Value-Based Care. We aim to improve the member experience and reduce the cost of care by prioritizing member centric care\nand incentivizing healthcare providers to keep their members healthy, which can lower healthcare costs over the member\u2019s lifetime. From our earliest\nwork with customer groups including the NHS, which provides primary care at a fraction of the cost of what is typical in the United States, we have\ndeveloped deep experience in the delivery of care within capitated systems. Through the creation of a proactive, digital-first care network, which\nprovides every member with a well-structured \u201cCare Pyramid\u201d, we shift the majority of member interactions to virtual care and provide timely and\ntargeted in-person care when needed. With the goal of providing a complete solution, our VBC solution manages the totality of a member\u2019s\nhealthcare, including taking on full financial responsibility for costs ranging from primary through to secondary and tertiary care settings (with total\nrisk capped through reinsurance products). By significantly improving accessibility and availability of primary and urgent care, we believe it is\npossible to create significant downstream savings. Delivery of our solution in the United\n198\nTable of Contents\nKingdom, for example, has demonstrated that up to 35% downstream cost savings are possible. For a description of the study done on our\nsolution, see \u201cBabylon\u2019s Business\u2014Overview.\u201d\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe are pursuing the following strategies in order to expand access to high-quality, affordable healthcare:\n\u2022\nExpand covered population and scope of services in existing markets. We have a significant opportunity to cover additional lives in the markets we\ncurrently serve by both (i) signing contracts with new payers and enterprise customers and (ii) expanding the scope of services provided to our\nexisting customer base. If we expand the scope of services we provide, for example, by upselling a clinical service contract to a VBC contract, we\nhave the ability to increase our current applicable annual run-rate revenue (\u201cARR\u201d). This is demonstrated by the increase in ARR as of July 31, 2021\nto approximately $323 million as a result of the contract which became effective July 1, 2021 from approximately $170 million and $273 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively. We continue to demonstrate that our offerings are attractive and cost-saving for payers. In our\npartnership with the NHS, we have saved up to 35% of hospital costs, while delivering high-quality healthcare to members. For a description of the\nstudy done on our solution, see \u201cBabylon\u2019s Business\u2014Overview.\u201d We believe that these demonstrated savings will both attract new customers\nand convince existing licensing and FFS customers to upgrade to our VBC offering, Babylon 360, and we have already been successful in doing so\n\u2013 since the start of our expansion into the U.S. market, several customers have upgraded their contracts from initially planned clinical services\nprovision to Babylon 360 contracts.\n\u2022\nExpand to new markets with new and existing customers. Thanks to the scalability of our digital-first platform we are able to efficiently expand into\nnew geographical markets, both within and outside the United States. We believe that our existing customer relationships present a particularly\nattractive growth opportunity. Currently, our focus is on the expansion within the U.S. market, but, as a global operator, we will continue to evaluate\nopportunities outside the United States. To date we have deployed our technology in 16 countries and actively provide clinical services in three.\nWe will continue to leverage the deployable nature of our model and technology to pursue business opportunities, both in licensing and clinical\ncare, in new markets with attractive economic opportunities.\n\u2022\nPursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions. While we expect organic growth to be our primary driver, there may be complementary targets with\nthe potential to make valuable additions to our existing platform, either through partnership or acquisition. Recent examples of this approach\ninclude our previously announced strategic partnership with Palantir and our strategic investment in Higi, which augments our digital infrastructure\nthrough a bricks and mortar presence of 10,000 FDA-cleared Smart Health stations in retail chains such as Sam\u2019s Club, Kroger, Rite Aid, and Publix,\namong others, with 73% of the U.S. population living within five miles of a Higi station.\n\u2022\nContinuing to invest our technology to improve our care capabilities. We have invested heavily in our technology platform since our founding and\nbelieve that it is both world-leading and vital to our continued success in the provision of digital-first care solutions. With this view, we will\ncontinue to invest in our technology platform and seek to enhance our leadership position in clinically focused healthcare AI and other\napplications that can improve our member health and experience.\nOur Technology\nTo date, Babylon has heavily invested in a proprietary healthcare delivery platform that we believe is member-friendly, reduces administrative\nburden for our clinicians, and will enable us to scale across geographies. Our solutions are powered by a cloud-enabled platform that is built to maximize\ninteroperability, be accessible to individuals through all kinds of mobile devices, and leverage custom workflow platforms to optimize efficiency in\nclinicians\u2019 back offices. We believe the key features of our technology platform are the following:\n\u2022\nProprietary. Over the last decade, we have designed a proprietary platform on which we can drive the creation of cohesive, custom solutions\npowered by AI. In contrast, our competitors rely on many third-party\n199\nTable of Contents\nsolutions that are decoupled and disjointed, reducing the ability to leverage AI and data to drive overall efficiency and value for their members and\nproviders. Our software is built in line with strong security and privacy controls, and our processes are externally audited for compliance with\nrequired standards. We use highly agile software development methodologies to promote effective, metric-driven development while complying\nwith our secure software development lifecycle.\n\u2022\nCloud Architecture. Our globally accessible services are cloud enabled by design for maximum efficiency and scale. Our approach to delivery\nallows us to operate in multiple cloud regions around the world with a federated approach that enables unique data residency and data sovereignty\nrequirements per country. Built from inception to be powered from the cloud, we aim to be cloud service provider-agnostic, enabling us to deploy\nour solutions more broadly and globally where there may be a gap in cloud provider coverage through various strategic partnerships.\n\u2022\nIntegration. Using a standards-based, interoperable interface allows us to integrate seamlessly and efficiently with third party electronic medical\nrecords systems and other healthcare data providers. Leveraging a standards-based HL7-FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)\napproach, we are able to ingest, process and store data from a wide variety of sources, creating a unified view of our members (whilst ensuring this\nis in compliance with UK privacy laws).\n\u2022\nWidely Accessible. We deliver our digital solution to our members and providers via cutting-edge front-end technology through both web and\nsmartphone applications. At the same time, we serve individuals with basic flip phones through a proprietary application in developing countries\nsuch as Rwanda, facilitating our mission of delivering affordable and accessible healthcare to all.\n\u2022\nOptimizes Back Office Efficiency. Leveraging open source and third-party technology, we have built a highly configurable platform that automates\nnon-clinical tasks such as processing referrals and prescription management, reducing providers\u2019 administrative burden and increasing their\noperational efficiency. This platform approach allows us to leverage our data and AI strategy to deliver these \u201cback office\u201d workflow services,\ndriving additional value for our members by mitigating friction and delays, which individuals typically face in traditional healthcare delivery models.\nHow We Leverage Artificial Intelligence\nUnderpinning our healthcare delivery platform is our bespoke AI architecture that has been designed to help our members navigate their personal\nhealthcare journeys. We believe that our member-centric approach, which considers our members\u2019 healthcare and sick-care, differentiates us from our\ncompetitors, whose solutions adopt a narrow, often-times impersonal approach that fails to consider the full spectrum of healthcare. Leveraging our\nteam\u2019s deep experience in building intelligent healthcare systems, our AI architecture has been designed from the ground up over the last decade to\ndeliver actionable insights and recommendations.\nA core feature of this architecture is the inclusion, by design, of core principles such as interpretability and explainability. These features are critical\nwhen delivering insights through member-facing products since they provide transparency to our clinicians (via our \u201cclinician-in-the-loop\u201d platform) for\nthem to understand the provenance of the data and parameters in our AI and to have the ability to independently assess the basis of our AI\u2019s\nconclusions. These principles, which are inherent features of causal approaches to AI, help overcome the \u201cblack-box\u201d problem \u2013 the notion that an AI\nsystem can deliver insights, but is incapable of explaining how it has arrived at its conclusions. This capability provides our customers and clinicians\nwith a critical layer of transparency on the insights provided to our members via products such as the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment.\nAnother key feature of our AI technology is its ability to quantify the uncertainty of its predictions. In contrast to the majority of \u2018black-box\u2019 AI\nsystems which tend towards making overly-confident predictions, uncertainty-aware AI systems are better equipped to quantify and assess how much\nadditional information is required to make predictions with a specified level of confidence.\n200\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, our AI has been designed to be data-efficient and flexible with respect to the information it consumes, enabling us to rapidly adapt\nour models to new populations. Our AI systems leverage health records from multiple sources where available and in compliance with applicable privacy\nrules, but also permit other sources of evidence such as data, for example, clinician input and published studies, and medical knowledge, including from\nclinical guidelines and pathways, to be incorporated where data quality or abundance is a concern. For example, our systems benefit from feedback from\nour teams of local clinicians who review our AI systems\u2019 use of data in light of local beliefs, language and healthcare concerns. This approach has\nallowed us to adapt and rapidly localize our AI models to account for differences in language, culture and disease burden across geographies, enabling\nus to serve populations globally.\nOur Go-to-Market Model\nWorking with governments, payers and providers to deliver quality healthcare services globally, we monetize our platform in three primary ways \u2013\nsoftware licensing, clinical services and value-based care.\nSoftware Licensing\nThrough our Babylon Cloud Services offering, we license our digital platform to a broad spectrum of customers, including healthcare providers and\npayers. We believe that software licensing represents an effective way of leveraging our technology platform into customer segments or geographies\nwhere we do not currently have commercial operations or a near-term plan to market clinical services or VBC contracts. During the year ended December\n31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 31.0% and 34.3%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from software licensing.\nClinical Services\nWe provide access to our digital platform to customers including health plans, enterprises that offer our platform to their employees, and directly to\nprivate users. Our clinical services offering is tailored to our customers\u2019 needs, but can include access to our full range of digital care tools, including our\napp-based Digital Suite (which may be accessed as a per member per month fee and classified as licensing fee revenue), as well as access to\nconsultations with licensed medical professionals. Our revenue model for clinical services is based on a combination of FFS and capitated fees. Under our\nFFS arrangements, payers pay a specified amount for each virtual consultation or patient visit. As a result, FFS-based revenue is demand-driven and\ndependent on volume of virtual consultations or, in some cases, patient visits completed. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months\nended June 30, 2021, approximately 36.1% and 14.1%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from clinical services. While clinical services are currently\nthe largest historical proportion of our revenue, we expect that growth in our other revenue streams will likely outpace it in future periods.\nValue-Based Care Contracts\nUnder VBC contracts, we are able to provide personalized, end-to-end care solutions through the creation of a comprehensive, digital-first care\npyramid tailored to each member\u2019s specific needs and circumstances. Paired with our mix of service support and provider network access, we manage the\ntotality of a patient\u2019s healthcare, including taking financial responsibility for costs incurred in (i) primary care settings, referred to as professional risk\u037e and\n(ii) primary, secondary and tertiary care settings, referred to as global risk.\nUnder VBC contracts, we proactively manage the healthcare needs of our members in a centralized manner, including under our risk-based\ncontracts where we negotiate a fixed monthly payment, often based on a percentage of the payer\u2019s premium or Medical Loss Ratio (\u201cMLR\u201d) with the\npayer. We receive a fixed fee for and assume financial responsibility for member healthcare services. Through member engagement with our services, and\nwhile maintaining high clinical quality and excellent member experience, we seek to improve member healthcare while keeping the costs we pay for member\nhealthcare below the fixed fee we receive. Our\n201\nTable of Contents\ncost savings are typically driven by improved management of chronic conditions and proactive, preventative care to keep members healthier thereby\navoiding unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Patients, payers and providers are encouraged to adopt our care pathways. We\nestablish VBC contracts either as digital-first from inception, or in certain circumstances we acquire non-digital VBC contracts and transition them to our\ndigital-first framework. As we shift all current VBC member interactions into our digital-first framework, we believe that our member management\ncapabilities and our members\u2019 health outcomes will improve and our cost of care delivery will decrease.\nEach VBC contract is different in terms of structure and pricing due to state regulations, national health systems and payer negotiations. Before\nentering into a new contract, we analyze internal and external data on a given patient population, including, but not limited to, historical claims,\npopulation demographics, utilization and other key performance data. We perform a full actuarial analysis and combine this information with inflation and\nlocal market adjustments. Because our business is to manage healthcare rather than act as a reinsurer, we also have \u201cstop loss\u201d insurance on all of our\nVBC contracts that generally is invoked when expenditures on any individual patient exceeds a predefined threshold in any given year. This insurance is\nnot material to the overall expense structure and costs up to a few percentage points of revenue. The fees paid under VBC contracts per at-risk patient are\nsignificantly higher than the fees for services provided under FFS arrangements. Consequently, when costs for providing service are effectively\nmanaged, the revenue and profit generation opportunities under VBC contracts are significantly more attractive than under FFS arrangements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 32.9% and 51.6%, respectively, of our revenue was\nderived from value-based care arrangements. VBC is a more recent revenue stream for us, although we expect it to be an increasing proportion of our total\nrevenue in future periods.\nOur Global Reach\nAs of July 31, 2021, an aggregate of approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software licensing offerings in 16\ncountries across Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa, as further described below.\nUnited States\nSince January 2020, we have grown to serve approximately three million members in six states. Over 100,000 of these members were VBC members\nas of July 31, 2021. We offer our members 24/7 access to affiliated healthcare providers licensed in all 50 states.\nClinical Services\nWe began delivering our solutions through our digital platform in the United States in January 2020 by providing access to our digital platform,\nincluding virtual clinical services, on a licensing and FFS basis to health plans across the United States. This business model is consistent with that of\nour agreement with Bupa in the United Kingdom, as described below. This model has been, and we believe will continue to be, a valuable entry point into\ndelivering our holistic Babylon 360 solution to member populations we serve on a clinical fee-for-service and licensing basis. In Missouri, for example, we\noffered access to clinical services on a fee-for-service and licensing basis to members through Home State Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene\nCorporation, and were able to shift a subset of that population to our full Babylon 360 solution within nine months.\nValue-Based Care, Including Babylon 360\nBuilding on our success in making available clinical services to Centene members in Missouri, as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus\ntoday we offer our Babylon 360 solution to approximately 19,000 Home State\n202\nTable of Contents\nHealth members through a VBC agreement. This arrangement is a primary example of Babylon\u2019s core strategy in the United States \u2013 providing digital-first,\nvalue-based care for which we are paid a pre-agreed capitation rate. After signing the VBC agreement in the summer of 2020, we commenced offering\nservice access in October 2020, surpassing our own expectations in member engagement with approximately 20% of households registered, improving\nhealth outcomes and accessibility.\nWe have also acquired non-digital VBC contracts and are transitioning them to our digital-first Babylon 360 framework. Through two California-\nbased independent physician associations, or IPAs \u2013 FirstChoice Medical Group (\u201cFCMG\u201d) and Meritage Medical Network \u2013 that were acquired by an\naffiliated professional entity, we offer access to VBC services on a capitation basis and carry a combination of professional and global risk for Medicare\nAdvantage, Medi-Cal and commercial VBC members. As we shift all interactions with these approximately 67,000 VBC members into our digital-first\nBabylon 360 framework, we believe that our member management capabilities and our members\u2019 health outcomes will improve, and our cost of care\ndelivery will decrease.\nThe expansion of our VBC offerings in the United States, including our digital-first Babylon 360 solution, is our primary focus for growth on a go-\nforward basis. We are driving such growth by expanding our existing service with our current health care plan customers into their wider operations and\nmarkets, converting more of our U.S. customers to the holistic Babylon 360 solution, and attracting new customers to the Babylon platform. For example,\nwe recently entered into an agreement with an existing customer to make our Babylon 360 solution available to approximately 15,000 members in the state\nof New York and began deploying this solution in the third quarter of 2021.\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, we deliver our Babylon GP at Hand in England offering, providing primary medical services under a contract with the NHS,\nand provide clinical services through our agreement with Bupa, a private insurer, as well as through agreements with employers for whom we provide\nemployees access to our clinical services. We provide these services through a mix of fee-for-service and capitated fees.\nBabylon GP at Hand\nThrough our Babylon GP at Hand offering, which we started in 2017, we provide primary medical services for patients registered with Babylon GP at\nHand or temporarily resident in the area and seeking primary medical care. Our reimbursement model is the same as other GPs in England which hold\ngeneral medical services contracts and is based on the Carr-Hill formula \u2013 a capitation model primarily based on age and gender of the patient. Since 2017,\nwe have grown our Babylon GP at Hand offering over fifty times, from 2,000 to over 100,000 members, and from one location in London to seven physical\nlocations in London and Birmingham. Today, anyone who lives or works within 30 minutes of one of our physical premises, irrespective of age and health,\ncan register with Babylon GP at Hand. We have further improved accessibility of healthcare for our Babylon GP at Hand patients by providing digital\nconsultation within two hours of a registered patient seeking an appointment compared to over a week, the average for an NHS GP appointment. At the\nsame time, Babylon GP at Hand has received an overall \u201cGood\u201d rating from the CQC, the independent regulator of health and social care in England. CQC\nis responsible for inspecting health and social care providers in England and, based on its inspection, assigns one of four ratings, which are\n\u201cInadequate\u201d, \u201cRequires improvement\u201d, \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cOutstanding\u201d, to five domains, including \u201cSafe\u201d, \u201cWell-led\u201d, \u201cResponsive\u201d, \u201cEffective\u201d and\n\u201cCaring\u201d, and an overall assessment covering all five domains. CQC also assigned an overall \u201cGood\u201d rating to Babylon Healthcare Services Limited,\nwhich is sub-contracted to deliver services to Babylon GP at Hand. Additionally, CQC assigned Babylon Healthcare Services Limited an \u201cOutstanding\u201d\nrating in the \u201cWell-led\u201d domain. Babylon GP at Hand has over 95% four and five-star ratings from its members, with a 95% retention rate.\nWe employ doctors, nurses, prescribing pharmacists and other specialists in order to deliver this care to our membership. Our work with the NHS\nhas demonstrated conclusive cost savings. The NHS\u2019s own studies have shown that our member base has experienced reduced acute care costs by over\n35% compared to a similar population.\n203\nTable of Contents\nBupa\nBupa is the United Kingdom\u2019s largest private health insurer, used by approximately two million people alongside the NHS. Bupa\u2019s covered\npopulation has access to Babylon\u2019s digital platform, for which we are paid a capitation fee per member. In addition, Bupa members can undertake virtual\nconsultations with our doctors or healthcare professionals, for which we receive a FFS. Following a virtual consultation, if appropriate, we then refer\nthese members into the secondary care system \u2013 either with the NHS or through Bupa\u2019s private network. We do not operate any physical premises in\norder to deliver healthcare to these members.\nCanada\nIn Canada, we deliver our Babylon Cloud Services offering via a software licensing agreement. We have entered into a seven-year agreement to\nlicense our white-labeled digital platform to TELUS Health, a healthcare provider, allowing TELUS to provide integrated clinical services to members\nthrough a TELUS-branded version of the Babylon digital platform.\nRest of the World\nIn furtherance of our global mission to provide accessible and affordable quality healthcare to everyone on Earth, we are continuing to expand our\nglobal reach, beginning in Southeast Asia and Rwanda.\nSoutheast Asia\nIn June 2018, we signed an agreement with Prudential, a leading provider of health insurance in Asia, to license our white-labeled digital platform to\nPrudential members through the Prudential-branded \u201cPulse\u201d app. Since then, we have configured our digital platform to offer services across 11 countries\nin Southeast Asia, in 9 languages, and including 14 epidemiological models.\nRwanda\nIn Rwanda, we deliver clinical services on a fee-for-service basis. Since commencing operations in Rwanda in 2019, we have scaled rapidly to cover\n2.5 million users in Rwanda today, providing both physical and telemedicine consultations through our network of local doctors, clinical field workers and\nother healthcare professionals. Initial funding for this operation was provided in conjunction with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and, following the\ninitial period, the government of Rwanda signed a 10-year agreement with us for the provision of clinical services. While its revenue contribution is\nrelatively small, we see Rwanda as a core part of our mission in order to deliver affordable and accessible healthcare to all, and in due course we expect to\nseek to expand our delivery further in Africa.\nSaudi Arabia\nWe currently license our symptom checker services to THIQAH Business Services (\u201cTHIQAH\u201d) who distribute such services in Saudi Arabia\nthrough an application called SEHA developed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Health. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health intended to decomission\nSEHA by July 31, 2021. However, SEHA has not been decommissioned as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and we do not know whether or\nwhen such decommission will be completed. Moreover, our licensing agreement with THIQAH has expired although THIQAH has continued to distribute\nour technology. If SEHA is decommissioned or we fail to renew our licensing contract with THIQAH, we may not be able to operate in Saudi Arabia until\nwe find an alternative application or application provider and our technology would be deployed in 15 countries instead of 16 countries.\nSales and Marketing\nWe have a robust near-term contract pipeline of committed and probable contracts totaling approximately $3.6 billion ARR constituting primarily\nvalue-based care contracts by value. ARR at the end of a given month is\n204\nTable of Contents\ncalculated at a point in time by multiplying such month\u2019s expected revenue by 12. Our pipeline at announcement of the proposed combination was\ncomprised of approximately 50 contracts, 27 of which were VBC contracts. VBC contracts on average are worth $130 million ARR, equating to\napproximately $3.5 billion ARR. Revenue from VBC contracts are on a capitated basis with a portion of the transaction price being variable due to\nprovisions for performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where amounts received are dependent upon factors such as\nquality metrics, member-specific attributes and healthcare service costs. We generally build our pipeline through a combination of responding to inbound\ninquiries, outbound sales and marketing efforts, and existing client relationships. While we do not generally find that we are participating in request-for-\nproposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) processes in our go-to-market activities due to our unique offering and competitive position, it\u2019s possible that these processes become\nmore prevalent in the future.\nOur marketing strategy is focused on building brand awareness by highlighting our digital-first solution and demonstrating the return on\ninvestment we provide for our existing customers. Our business customers include healthcare providers, insurers, governments, and employers that\nsponsor employee memberships as part of their benefits packages. We anticipate increasing our marketing team headcount and are investing in programs\ndesigned to elevate our brand in the market.\nAffiliated Physicians and Healthcare Professionals\nThe corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case\nlaw, in more than 30 U.S. states, all of which we operate in, though the broad variation between state application and enforcement of the doctrine makes\nan exact count difficult. Due to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our\nbusiness, we provide administrative and management services to affiliated professional entities pursuant to which those entities reserve exclusive control\nand responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract with such physician-owned entities\nthrough business support agreements for the provision of back office and administrative support services in exchange for a management fee. We have\nentered into option agreements or direct share transfer agreements with the owners of such affiliated entities to allow for timely succession planning. We\nexpect that the relationships with these affiliated practices and their owner-physicians will continue, and currently have no reason to believe that they will\nnot, although we cannot guarantee that they will. A material change in our relationship with these physician-owned entities, whether resulting from a\ndispute among the entities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our\nconsumers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition\nThe healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We\noperate in multiple international markets and have demonstrated the ability to provide comprehensive, digital-first, technology-enabled care across the\nfull healthcare value chain. We are not aware of any public company which compares precisely in terms of breadth and scope. Competitors in the market\nare generally focused on one specific slice of the healthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine) rather than\ndelivering the entire healthcare needs of a member. These platforms may be technology-enabled, but typically have highly specific physical\ninfrastructure, or are broad-based integrated care solutions that are difficult to scale.\nWe view as competitors those companies whose primary business is developing and marketing telemedicine platforms and services. Competition\nfocuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated services, operational experience, customer support,\nextent of customer base, and reputation. The lack of AI and broader member-centric healthcare technology in the more traditional telehealth companies\nsignificantly reduces the actionability of the data collected by the provider and increases the difficulty of robotic process automation. We believe our\ndigital-first approach is unique, enabling our members\n205\nTable of Contents\nto easily access the advice, support and treatment they need using digital and online tools, and is fully integrated with our clinical operations and\nprovider networks to provide an end-to-end healthcare solution. Furthermore, in our view, their limited ability to expand the value capture per customer in\nturn limits their total addressable market and future growth and valuation prospects.\nIn the health system market, healthcare systems could be considered competitors, but many have chosen to partner with us to integrate our\ncapabilities into their own offerings.\nWhile we do not believe there are currently any direct competitors with global reach that offer the full suite of solutions as we do, and believe we\nare well positioned to execute our business model and reinvent healthcare with our digital-first approach, we could face significant competition from\ntraditional health insurance companies in the future. The incumbent healthcare system and health insurance companies are larger than us and have\nsignificant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, greater resources, additional access to capital (including utilizing such\ncapital to acquire or partner with other companies or technologies) and a broader array of healthcare offerings than we currently do. Moreover, as we\nexpand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond clinical care and self-care, we could face intense competition from traditional\nhealthcare systems and health insurance companies that are already established, some of whom also utilize AI, telehealth, ePharma, virtual care delivery\nand next generation payer and provider models.\nWe also compete with new market entrants as well as large communications software players who offer an entry-level priced and simplified offering\nfor telehealth. Competition may also increase from large technology companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon, or Microsoft, who may wish\nto develop their own telehealth solutions, as well as from large retailers like Kroger, CVS Health Corporation, Walgreens or Walmart. With the emergence\nof COVID-19, we have also seen increased competition from consumer-grade video solutions, such as Zoom Video and Twilio. We believe that the\nbreadth of our existing client ecosystem, the depth of our technology platform, and our business-to-business focus on promoting existing healthcare\nbrands and integrating freely with multiple platforms increases the likelihood that stakeholders seeking to develop telehealth solutions, both within and\noutside of healthcare, will choose to collaborate with us.\nCompetition is based on many factors, including reputation and experience, types of health services offered, pricing and other terms and\nconditions, customer service, relationships with public and private health insurance providers (including ease of doing business, service provided, and\ncommission rates paid), size and financial strength ratings, among other considerations. We believe we compete favorably across many of these factors\nand have developed a digital platform and business model that we believe will be difficult for companies in the healthcare and traditional fee-for-service\nhealth insurance space to emulate.\nIntellectual Property\nThe protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We intend to rely upon a combination of\ntrademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, patents and other legal rights to establish and protect our\nintellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention of work product assignment agreements with our employees and\nconsultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.\nOur material intellectual property includes (without limitation) core items of our software, such as our Digital Health Suite mobile app and its\nfeatures, including our AI-enabled products such as the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment (which are also licensed to certain customers to\nintegrate into their own products). Our material intellectual property also includes certain AI technologies underlying the Symptom Checker and Health\nAssessment products. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and other legal rights to protect these software products and\nrelated technologies.\nThe use of patent protection, with a focus on the United States, is part of our intellectual property strategy. As of September 14, 2021, we own 15\ngranted U.S. utility patents and have 23 utility U.S. patent applications\n206\nTable of Contents\npending (four of which have been accepted for grant by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office but are currently proceeding through grant formalities).\nThese granted patents and applications primarily relate to our AI technologies in the fields of probabilistic reasoning and decision-making and natural\nlanguage processing for healthcare. Some of these technologies are used in our AI-enabled products such as the Symptom Checker and Health\nAssessment, including their medical reasoning and decision-making and conversational features, to facilitate an improved understanding of our members.\nWe rely on trademarks to protect the Babylon brand. As of September 14, 2021, we hold 76 foreign registered trademarks and two registered\ntrademarks in the United States, have 14 trademark applications pending and no U.S. trademark applications. Our registered trademark portfolio primarily\nseeks to protect the name BABYLON and our heart logo for relevant goods and services.\nWe continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. Intellectual property laws,\nprocedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented,\ninfringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States,\nand, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.\nCommitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership\nWe believe that leadership in environment, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues is central to our mission of putting accessible, affordable, and\nquality health services in the hands of everyone on Earth. Having a positive impact on our employees, customers, partners and the environment, with\nleadership that is accountable to our stakeholders, is critically important to our business.\nWe have examined and taken steps to address the ESG risks and opportunities of our operations, products and services. As our ESG efforts\nprogress, we plan to report how we oversee and manage ESG issues and evaluate our ESG objectives by using industry-specific frameworks such as the\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board and elements of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nOur ESG initiatives are organized into three pillars, which, in turn, contain focus areas for our attention and action.\nOur environmental pillar is focused on our commitment to being net zero by 2050, doing our part in reversing the deleterious impacts of climate\nchange on the health of our planet and people. As a first step, we are measuring our global Scope 1-3 GHG emissions to set a benchmark and expect to\npublish our emissions data and interim targets by the end of 2021. We solidified our net zero commitment by becoming a member of Tech Zero, a climate\naction group that is a partner to the United Nation\u2019s Race to Zero campaign, established to promote a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery.\nOur social pillar is focused on serving the needs of our people, our members, and other stakeholders.\n\u2022\nAddressing Healthcare Inequalities. Our business mission is intrinsically tied to our social pillar: making high-quality healthcare accessible and\naffordable for everyone. Underpinning our mission is a commitment to addressing inequalities in healthcare faced by those with low incomes and\nwho live in low resource settings. Whether it is partnering with the Rwandan government to help fulfill its pledge to provide universal healthcare\naccess, or expanding to offer value-based care to Medicaid recipients, we remove barriers to healthcare by customizing our model and services to\nmeet the unique needs of our members.\n\u2022\nTalent Attraction, Engagement and Retention. Our ability to attract a skilled workforce of engineers, mathematicians, scientists and healthcare\npractitioners, and a diverse workforce reflective of our members, is critical to meeting our mission and achieving results for our members, healthcare\npartners, shareholders and other\n207\nTable of Contents\nstakeholders. Reward at Babylon ensures that we all share in our collective success and align long-term incentives through bonus and stock\nawards or options. We extend our mission to our employees, encouraging healthy lifestyles, emotional and physical well-being and a work-life\nbalance through flexible work arrangements, healthy lifestyle perks, such as free yoga classes and healthy snacks, and health and well-being\nsupport from health advocates, mental health first aiders and well-being circles. Our Be Brilliant performance management framework ensures at\nleast bi-annual performance reviews and career pathway mapping.\n\u2022\nDiversity and Inclusion. With employees hailing from 60 countries and counting, Babylon\u2019s diversity is a cornerstone of our culture. Our Diversity,\nEquity, and Inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) program is incorporated across organizational departments, levels, and activities. Our Power of Diversity Resource\nGroups, which include Black Alliance Network, Women in Tech Health, LGBT Allies, and Interfaith, provide support to members and an avenue for\ngroups to advise senior stakeholders on DEI and business direction goals. Each group is provided an executive sponsor and budget to deliver\nevents and educational programs throughout the year. Our corporate holiday calendar and events are inclusive of a range of identities and\nbackgrounds, such as the inclusion of a variety of religious holidays such as Eid al-Fitr, Diwali, Christmas and others. Our DEI engagement scores\nhave demonstrated our efforts are working, with our most recent score being 8.2 out of 10.\n\u2022\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity. We know that our success is predicated on members trusting us to responsibly manage their most sensitive data\nand keep it safe and secure. Our data privacy and information security organizations work with business units from design to delivery, keeping our\nmembers in mind at every step. Our information security team represents 1% of our headcount and is led by our Vice President of Information\nSecurity, who reports directly to our CTO. Our Information Security Management System is certified to ISO 27001 and SOC Type II, and we are\naiming to be HiTrust certified by 2021-year end. The team\u2019s primary focus is securing our platforms through which most of our services are\ndelivered. Our mindset of \u2018security by design\u2019 means that security is considered a quality aspect of our product, embedded in product design from\noutset, rather than added as an overlay post-design. We consider a product with lower level of security to be a product with a lower level of quality.\nOur Data Privacy team is led by our Data Protection Officer who reports to the CFO. The team helps us to uphold members\u2019 right to privacy and\ncontrol of their data. We provide transparency about data uses and end user control\u2013expressed consent must be given for AI learning (personal\nidentifiers always removed), product improvement and marketing. We will never sell data. We also strictly comply with applicable jurisdictional\nregulations, such as HIPAA, the DPA 2018 and GDPR, ensuring we keep current through extensive horizon scanning and risk register maintenance.\nOur Governance Pillar is focused on our commitments to ethics and enterprise risk management.\n\u2022\nEthical Conduct. We uphold the highest standards of ethical business conduct, integrity and responsibility by ensuring employees strictly adhere\nto our policies that include our Code of Ethics and Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, and Whistleblower Policy.\n\u2022\nBoard Oversight of ESG. Oversight provided by the Board and subcommittees is focused on cyber security, clinical governance, and other key risk\nand compliance issues, Our Global Risk and Compliance (\u201cGRC\u201d) Framework, overseen by a GRC team, is integral to our enterprise risk management\nefforts. A GRC committee meets quarterly and reports to our Board\u2019s Audit Committee.\nAll of our actions and each of our ESG pillars are underpinned by our vision to be a leading digital-first, value-based care company where\nhealthcare revolves around the patient.\nEmployees\nAs of September 6, we employed approximately 2,189 individuals globally, of which approximately 1,864 were permanent. None of our employees in\nthe United States are represented by unions or party to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good\nand have not experienced interruptions to operations due to labor disagreements.\n208\nTable of Contents\nProperties\nOur corporate headquarters are currently located at 1 Knightsbridge Green, London SW1X 7QA, United Kingdom, for which the term of our lease\nexpires in September 2024.\nWe believe that our properties are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional\nspace in the future, we believe that it would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.\nRegulatory Environment\nThe healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which\ncontinue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are significant. Our profitability depends in part\nupon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers and independent contractors, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all\napplicable licenses. A review of our operations by regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the\nhealthcare legal or regulatory environment could change in ways that restrict or otherwise impact our operations. To the extent that any of our employees\nor third-party contractors engages in any misconduct or activity in violation of an applicable law, we may be subject to increased liability under the law or\nincreased government scrutiny. If any action is instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, such\naction could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Our operations may be adversely\naffected or disrupted due to restrictions imposed on third parties. Complying with any new legislation and regulations could be time-intensive and\nexpensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a digital health or a telehealth platform company, our operations are subject to United States federal, state and local and international regulation\nin the jurisdictions in which we do business. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring\ndevelopments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in\nour business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the\nsubject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be certain that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not\nresult in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our\noperations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the United States, state and federal regulatory authorities temporarily loosened or waived certain\nregulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example,\nmany state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other healthcare professionals licensed in other states to practice in their state\nwithout any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure or registration process. In addition, changes were made to\nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs (through legislative changes, and the exercise of regulatory discretion and authority) to increase access to\ntelehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior\nauthorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue\nbeyond this public health emergency period.\nWe believe that a return to the status quo would not have a materially negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during\n2020. Each of these agreements has a defined term and virtually none allow for immediate termination for convenience by the customer in question. For\nmany healthcare companies engaging in telehealth, the most significant potential concern about returning to the status quo is that restrictions on the\nreimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries could be re-imposed.\n209\nTable of Contents\nWe do not believe that the visit volume on our platform or visit revenue will materially decrease based on a return to the status quo from a\nregulatory perspective.\nMedical Provider Licensing, Practice of Medicine and Related Laws\nThe delivery of health care services is subject to state, federal, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards,\nrelating to, among other things, the standard or adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment,\npersonnel, operating policies and procedures, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of\nthese laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretations.\nPhysicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in\nthe state or local jurisdiction in which the patient is located. We have established systems to confirm our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed\nunder applicable state or local law and that their provision of telehealth to members is delivered in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth,\nalthough these subjects necessarily depend in some instances on collection of accurate information from patients. Depending on the jurisdiction, failure\nto comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable, or\nprior payments being subject to recoupment, an interruption of the services we deliver, and/or civil, criminal or administrative penalties.\nCorporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the United States\u037e Fee Splitting\nState corporate practice laws prohibit lay entities (i.e., entities that are not owned by a licensed healthcare professional, like Babylon Holdings),\nfrom practicing medicine. To comply with the requirements of these prohibitions, we contract with affiliated physician organizations to provide health care\nservices to customers and members. Under these arrangements, our platform is used by the affiliated physician organizations to facilitate the delivery of\ntelehealth services by the affiliated physician organizations and their patients in accordance with the customer and member contracts. Under these\narrangements we also provide our affiliated physician organizations with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and management\nservices, and they pay us for those services via management and other service fees. These arrangements are also subject to state fee splitting and state\nand federal anti-kickback and similar laws that restrict or define the kinds of financial relationships we can have with our affiliated physician\norganizations.\nState corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state, and from federal anti-kickback prohibitions. In\naddition, these requirements are subject to interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do\nnot have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of\nthe state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the\nprohibited corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such\nevent, failure to comply could lead to significant adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or\nadministrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of\nengagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.\nHIPAA, GDPR and Other Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations\nIn the U.S., numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability,\nintegrity, and other processing of protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) and personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). In the UK, this is known as\n\u2018personal data\u2019 and \u2018special category data\u2019 (the latter includes health data which attracts stronger protections under the UK Privacy laws). These laws\nand regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of\n210\nTable of Contents\nprotected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the\nbusiness associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. We are business associates under HIPAA and we execute business associate\nagreements with our customers.\nHIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, such as us, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is\nused or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the\nuse of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare\ntransactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.\nHIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations start at $119 per\nviolation and are not to exceed $59,522 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.786 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year.\nHowever, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of\ntheir residents. Courts may award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a\nprivate right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in\nstate civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.\nIn addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered\nentities and business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology\nwhereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the\nviolator.\nHIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that\ncompromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees\nor authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days\nafter discovery of the breach.\u201d If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the\nname of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the\nlocal media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.\nIn addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and\nsecurity of PHI and other types of PII. These laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its\nimplementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing interpretations, and we expect new\nlaws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future.\nOutside of the United States, we, along with a significant number of our customers, are subject to laws, rules, regulations, guidance and industry\nstandards related to data privacy and cyber security, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection,\nretention or transfer of data. For example, GDPR and, now that the U.K. has exited the European Union, the DPA 2018 and U.K. GDPR contain numerous\nrequirements and changes from previous European Union law, including more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers and heavier\ndocumentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the\nEU were introduced, including greater control over personal data by data subjects (e.g., the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU\nconsumers, data breach notification requirements (which differ to those listed under HIPAA above, if required report within 72 hours of becoming aware\nof the breach, and potentially also the requirement to notify affected data subjects) and increased fines. In particular, under the GDPR and the DPA\n211\nTable of Contents\n2018, fines of up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for certain\nviolations. The GDPR and DPA 2018 requirements apply not only to third-party relationships, but also to transfers of information between us and our\nsubsidiaries, including employee information. We are required to comply with the GDPR and DPA 2018 as a \u201cData Controller\u201d and a \u201cData Processor.\u201d In\n2018, we appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee and supervise our compliance with GDPR and DPA 2018 data protection regulations. As a result\nof various changes in relation to European data transfer rules (i.e. CJEU Schrems II, EDPB guidelines on supplementary measures, new EU Standard\nContractual Clauses and possibly new UK Standard Contractual Clauses in the coming months) all intra-group or outside of the group existing and future\ntransfers of European originated personal data will have to be assessed and possible revisited to take into consideration the changes. This is likely to\ntrigger specific remediation costs and expenses in 2021 and 2022.\nGlobally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards\ncovering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, online, the use of data to inform\nmarketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use,\nprocessing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. New regulation or legislative actions regarding\ndata privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing business and could have a material adverse\nimpact on our operations and cash flows. Further, given the risk and penalties associated with this area, commercial contractual liability and indemnity\nprovisions relating to data protection breaches and incidents can be particularly onerous, leading to risks of punitive damages/penalties in the event of a\nbreach.\nWhile we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the GDPR and the DPA 2018 on us and despite our ongoing efforts to bring practices into\ncompliance, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control, such as limited financial or human resources, or other factors\noutside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential\ninconsistencies amongst various EU member states. Indeed, case law rulings can be inconsistent and unprecedented in this area, leading to more\nuncertainty regarding acceptable levels of compliance. Any failure or perceived failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures, or\nmeasures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or customer communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or\ncontractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and\nenforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers lose trust in us, which could have an adverse\neffect on our reputation and business.\nThis complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection, and information security creates significant compliance issues for us and\nour customers and potentially exposes us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. While we have implemented data privacy and security\nmeasures in an effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection, some PHI and other PII or confidential\ninformation is transmitted to us by third parties, who may not implement adequate security and privacy measures, and it is possible that laws, rules and\nregulations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices\nor those of third parties who transmit PHI and other PII or confidential information to us. If we or these third parties are found to have violated such laws,\nrules or regulations, it could result in government-imposed fines, orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or their practices, or criminal\ncharges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or\nrequire us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing,\nconsumer communications and information security in the United States, the\n212\nTable of Contents\nEuropean Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nFuture laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop\nand market new services and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue.\nOther U.S. Healthcare Laws\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and\nregulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payers, our\ncontractual relationships with our providers, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular\nimportance are:\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring\nMedicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or a member of such\nphysician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the\nentity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services\u037e\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other\nremuneration (i) in return for referring or to induce the referral of an individual for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of items or services\npaid for in whole or in part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) ordering, leasing, purchasing or\nrecommending or arranging for the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items, services, good, or facility paid for in whole or in part by any federal\nhealth care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to\nviolate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act\u037e\n\u2022\nthe criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HITECH, HIPAA, and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent\nstatement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a\nperson or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation\u037e\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act that imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that, among other things, knowingly submit false or fraudulent\nclaims for payment to the government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, or retain\nidentified Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, and allows for qui tam or whistleblower suits by private individuals on behalf of the government\u037e\n\u2022\nvarious federal healthcare-focused criminal laws that impose criminal liability for intentionally submitting false or fraudulent claims, or making false\nstatements, to the government\u037e\n\u2022\nreassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or\nMedicaid programs\u037e\n\u2022\nsimilar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services\nreimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging\nin some practices such as splitting fees with physicians\u037e\n213\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies requiring certain modality and other actions to establish a provider-patient\nrelationship, deliver care, or prescribe medications as part of a telehealth service\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations and policies relating to licensure and the practice of telehealth services across state lines\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding the dispensing or delivery of medications and devices\u037e\n\u2022\nstate laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding reporting requirements and patient consent, education, and follow-up related\nto treatment, including treatment and education for certain specific topics, such as, contraception, HIV and other STIs and state reporting for HIV,\nSTI, and infectious diseases\u037e\n\u2022\nlaws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices\u037e\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act that imposes penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments\u037e\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are\nmedically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to enroll and participate in\nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs, to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our\nbusiness activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove\ncostly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment,\nimprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws\nand regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions\nare sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any\nother failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of\nthese laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention\nfrom the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.\nTo enforce compliance with the federal laws, the OIG has recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of\ninvestigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming\nand can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse\neffect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble\ndamages and penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for\nsignificant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and heavy penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such\nsettlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity\nagreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources\nto investigating healthcare providers\u2019 compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.\nThe laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you\nthat any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not\n214\nTable of Contents\nmaterially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation\nauthorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.\nHealthcare Regulation Worldwide\nUnited Kingdom\nThe regulator of health services at a system level in England is the CQC. Any provider of certain regulated healthcare activities in England must be\nregistered with the CQC, and it is an offence for an unregistered person to provide such services. The CQC monitors, inspects and regulates such\nproviders to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety and it publishes what it finds, including performance ratings to help people\nchoose care.\nWhere a CQC inspection finds deficiencies in the service provision, it will make recommendations for improvement and the CQC generally aims to\nwork in cooperation with healthcare providers to ensure voluntary compliance. However, where this is not possible, the CQC has powers to take\nenforcement action, including:\n\u2022\nissuing requirement notices or warning notices to set out what improvements a provider must make\u037e\n\u2022\nmaking changes to a provider\u2019s registration to limit what they may do\u037e\n\u2022\nissuing cautions or fines\u037e and/or\n\u2022\nprosecuting cases where people are harmed or placed in danger of harm.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency regulates the elements of our products which are categorized as medical devices.\nCanada\nThe healthcare regulatory requirements in Canada apply primarily to individual practitioners rather than at a system level to service providers.\nWithin primary care, the main requirement is that the individual practitioner is in good standing with the relevant provincial professional regulatory body\n(generally the provincial College of Physicians). We, Babylon, as a healthcare services and technology provider, are not subject to such regulatory\noversight.\nRwanda\nOur services in Rwanda are regulated by the Rwandan Ministry of Health, both through its overall responsibility for healthcare provision within\nRwanda and through contractual mechanisms contained within its contract with us.\nMedical Device Regulation\nSome of Babylon\u2019s digital software products are considered medical devices in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Specifically, our\nsymptom checker (\u201cTriage\u201d) and our health assessment tool (\u201cHealthcheck\u201d) are registered as medical devices with the UK Medicines and Healthcare\nProduct Regulatory Agency and the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority. Both products are placed on the UK market bearing the European CE\nmark, indicating conformity to EU medical device legislation\u037e both current products are placed on the market under the EU MDD. As per the Brexit\nTransition Treaty, the UK accepts the CE mark as evidence of conformity until June 2023. However, neither Triage nor Healthcheck has been\nindependently tested or approved by a notified body.\nBabylon considers that Triage and Healthcheck are qualified for enforcement discretion in the US, meaning no registration with the FDA is required.\n215\nTable of Contents\nBabylon\u2019s current products are not considered medical devices in other jurisdictions where the products are marketed, including Malaysia, Hong\nKong, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Canada and Rwanda. Babylon has confirmed the\nregulatory position in these jurisdictions with local regulators.\nISO 13485\nRegulatory requirements are increasingly stringent throughout every step of a product\u2019s life cycle, including service and delivery. Increasingly,\norganizations in the industry are expected to demonstrate their quality management processes and ensure best practice in everything they do. ISO 13485,\nissued by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, is the medical device industry\u2019s internationally agreed standard, sets out the\nrequirements for a quality management system specific to the medical devices industry.\nOur quality management system, in which our medical devices have been developed, has been independently assessed and certified by a notified\nbody to EN ISO 13485:2016 standard.\nDCB 0129/0160 (National Health Service U.K. standards for design and implementation of digital health technologies)\nDCB 0129 is the clinical risk management standard which manufacturers of health IT systems and apps need to comply with. The standard is\ngoverned by NHS Digital and compliance is mandatory under the U.K. Health and Social care Act 2012. Digital health technology can introduce as well as\nmitigate clinical risk. NHS Digital requires that organizations who manufacture health IT systems and apps undertake a formal risk assessment and\nevidence the measures which have been put in place to mitigate risk. Proactively demonstrating that a product is safe helps to protect from litigation and\nvisibly demonstrates best-practice to customers. To comply with the standard, we undertake a formal risk assessment on the product and produces three\ndocuments summarizing the outcome: the Clinical Risk Management Plan, Hazard Log and Clinical Safety Case Report.\nUK Medical Device Regulation\nFor the purposes of a post-Brexit Great Britain, the EU MDD, amongst others, is given effect in UK law through the Medical Devices Regulations\n2002, as amended (the \u201cUK MDR\u201d). The UK MDR continue to have effect in Great Britain after the Brexit transition period. This means that since January\n1, 2021, the Great Britain route to market and labelling requirements is still based on the requirements derived from the EU MDD. The UK MDR does not\ncurrently include any of the amendments that are made by, amongst others, the new EU Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 (the \u201cEU MDR\u201d), which\ncame into effect in the EU after the Brexit transition period. Accordingly, the EU MDR shall not automatically apply in Great Britain. Instead, the recent\nMedicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 supplements the UK MDR.\nInternational Regulation\nWe expect over time to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through growth and acquisitions. In such a case, our international\noperations will be subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-\ncorruption laws\u037e economic sanctions laws\u037e various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations\u037e corporate governance, privacy, data\nprotection, data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations\u037e\ndiscriminatory licensing procedures\u037e required localization of records and funds\u037e and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the\nexpansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of\nU.S. law, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption\nlaws that apply in countries where we do business.\n216\nTable of Contents\nThe Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering,\nor providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain\nbusiness or gain some other business advantage. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from\ncommitting a bribery offense. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations. In addition, we\ncannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which\nexisting laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments\nof the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions\nand embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations,\ncollectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. We may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all such applicable laws, which\ncould result in our being subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. Likewise,\nany investigation of any potential violations of such laws by United Kingdom, United States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on\nour reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our products are subject to U.S. import and export controls and trade and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export\nAdministration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and solutions to certain countries,\ngovernments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Exports of our products and services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations.\nIf in the future we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal penalties, including loss of\nexport privileges and substantial fines for us and for the individuals working for us.\nIn addition, changes in our solution, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our members with international operations\nfrom deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments or persons\naltogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation or change in the countries, governments, persons or\ntechnologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to\nour platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or\nsell our solution would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcomes of\nthese matters are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n217\nTable of Contents",

Discussion is based on Babylon Holdings Limited\u2019s financial information\nprepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, which may differ in material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in other\njurisdictions, including U.S. GAAP. Certain statements in this \u201cBabylon\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d\nare forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.\nOur future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under sections\ntitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d \u201cWe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d as used herein refer to Babylon\nHoldings Limited and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and to Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries\n(including Alkuri) following the consummation of the Business Combination.\nOverview\nBabylon Holdings is a leading, global, end-to-end healthcare solution provider utilizing advanced digital-first pathways to deliver meaningfully-\nimproved healthcare to our customers. Babylon Holdings develops affordable healthcare services accessible to members on digital devices platforms and\nproviding technology solutions to medical professionals by automating routine tasks for the care of patients. It also uses its technology to step in early\nand help members become more informed about medical events, so they can make informed decisions and stay healthier longer. Babylon Holdings\ncombines artificial intelligence and broader technologies with human expertise to deliver modern healthcare.\nWe monetize our products and services in three primary ways:\n\u2022\nValue-Based Care, or VBC, in which we manage a proportion or the entire medical costs of a member population and capture the cost savings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 32.9% and 51.6%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from\nvalue based care arrangements.\n\u2022\nClinical Services, in which our affiliated providers deliver medical consultations, typically on a fee-for-service basis. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 36.1% and 14.1%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from clinical services.\n\u2022\nSoftware Licensing, in which we sell our digital suite of products to partners who provide care through their own medical networks. During the year\nended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 31.0% and 34.3%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from software\nlicensing.\nAs of July 31, 2021, approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software offerings in 16 countries across Europe,\nNorth America, Asia, and Africa. We have scaled our VBC offering rapidly over the last year to become one of the largest VBC networks in the United\nStates, with over 100,000 VBC members as of July 31, 2021, and we expect to remain focused on U.S. growth. Our company has developed as follows:\n\u2022\n2013: Founded by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ali Parsadoust.\n\u2022\n2014: Became the first digital-first health service provider to be registered with the CQC, the healthcare services regulator and inspector in England.\n\u2022\n2015: Began providing clinical services through our virtual care platform, offering diagnosis, advice and treatments via medical professionals to\npatients on a remote basis.\n\u2022\n2016: First expanded outside the United Kingdom, launching in Rwanda.\n225Table of Contents\n\u2022\n2017: Our technology was made available for licensing to corporate and institutional clients\n\u2022\n2018: We launched our agreement with Prudential in Asia and since then have been rolling out our symptom checker and health assessment\nsolutions across 11 countries.\n\u2022\n2018: We launched our partnership with TELUS in Canada to use our platform to deliver digital health services across Canada.\n\u2022\n2020: Our first end-to-end digital, integrated VBC service, Babylon 360, was formed. Babylon 360 has since expanded in North America and Europe.\nDuring that time, we have also completed certain investments and acquisitions in recent years that have helped improve our ability to deliver our\nproducts in services:\n\u2022\nDayToDay. In October 2019, we purchased a majority stake in Health Innovators Inc. (d/b/a DayToDay). This acquisition is intended to bolster\nBabylon\u2019s product offering by providing patient management for acute care episodes.\n\u2022\nHigi. In May 2020, we acquired a minority interest in Higi, as well as an option to acquire the remainder of Higi. We have announced our intention\nto exercise this option primarily using our shares as consideration shortly after the completion of the Business Combination. Higi is a maker of\nhealth kiosks found in retail pharmacies and groceries that provide free screenings of blood pressure, weight, pulse and body mass index. This\nplanned acquisition is intended to increase our reach to users and our ability to provide clinical service offerings to our customers.\n\u2022\nFresno Health Care. In October 2020, we acquired certain portions of the Fresno Health Care business of FirstChoice Medical Group (together,\n\u201cFCMG\u201d) for $25.7 million. This acquisition is intended to advance the growth of our value-based care services by integrating our digital-first tools\nwith the ability to provide end-to-end healthcare services in order to create a more accessible and seamless health care experience for our members.\n\u2022\nMeritage Medical Network. In April 2021, we acquired Meritage Medical Network (\u201cMeritage\u201d) for approximately $31.0 million. This acquisition is\nintended to expand the growth of our value-based care services digital-first tools to over 20,000 Medicare Advantage and Commercial HMO\npatients within the Meritage network.\nWe have experienced rapid revenue growth in the past year in particular as we have recently expanded our VBC offerings. Our Revenue was $79.3\nmillion and $16.0 million, our Cost of care delivery was $67.3 million and $19.8 million, our Platform and application expenses were $48.7 million and $16.9\nmillion, our Research and development expenses were $35.5 million and $51.2 million, our Operating loss was $175.5 million and $162.8 million for the years\nended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Revenue was $128.8 million and $22.5 million, our Cost of care delivery was $92.1 million and $18.8\nmillion, our Platform and application expenses were $21.3 million and $12.9 million, our Research and development expenses were $17.2 million and $20.9\nmillion, and our Operating loss was $78.6 million and $82.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our loss was $188.0\nmillion and $140.3 million, our EBITDA was ($165.0) million and ($143.2) million, and our Adjusted EBITDA was ($146.2) million and ($152.4) million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Loss was $75.7 million and $90.8 million, our EBITDA was ($62.7) million and ($78.9) million,\nand our Adjusted EBITDA was ($54.2) million and ($76.2) million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For a description of how\nwe calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, and the limitations of these non-IFRS\nfinancial measures, see \u201c\u2014Key Business and Financial Metrics\u2014EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world (\u201cPandemic\u201d) has altered the behavior of businesses and people, with significant negative effects\non national, state and local economies, the duration of which remains\n226\nTable of Contents\nunknown at this time. While several of the markets in which we operate are beginning to experience reductions in the effects of the Pandemic, it is not\ncurrently possible to predict the ultimate financial impact COVID-19 will have had on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Key\nfactors will include the extent to which changes in the behavior of people during the Pandemic result in a permanent change in their behavior, a longer-\nterm reversion back to pre-pandemic behaviors or a significant immediate change in behaviors as the impacts of the Pandemic become more manageable\nbecause of global vaccination programs.\nMerger Agreement\nIn June 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement by and among Babylon Holdings, Merger Sub, Alkuri and the Sponsors,\nwhich, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving company and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Babylon (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d).\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, Babylon Class A Shares will be traded on the NYSE, and we will be required to develop\nthe functions and resources necessary to operate as a public company, including employee-related costs and equity compensation, which may result in\nincreased operating expenses.\nKey Business and Financial Metrics\nWe review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics and non-IFRS measures, to evaluate our business,\nmeasure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\n(USD in thousands unless otherwise indicated)\nFor the\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2020\n2019\n$\u2019000\n$\u2019000\nRevenue:\nSoftware licensing revenue\n$ 44,245\n$ 10,354\n$ 24,603\n$\n2,002\nClinical services revenue\n18,134\n12,149\n28,631\n14,032\nValue-based care revenue\n66,392\n\u2014\n26,038\n\u2014\nTotal Revenue\n128,771\n22,053\n79,272\n16,034\nCost of care delivery\n(92,137)\n(18,820)\n(67,254)\n(19,810)\nPlatform & application expenses\n(21,377)\n(12,898)\n(48,664)\n(16,948)\nResearch & development expenses\n(17,201)\n(20,881)\n(35,524)\n(51,205)\nSales, general & administrative expenses\n(76,606)\n(52,762)\n(103,341)\n(90,891)\nLoss for the financial year\n(75,722)\n(90,813)\n(188,030)\n(140,287)\nEBITDA\n(62,678)\n(78,854)\n(164,984)\n(143,249)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(54,160)\n(76,243)\n(146,155)\n(152,358)\n(amounts in thousands unless otherwise indicated)\nAs of June 30,\nAs of December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2020\n2019\nUsers\n8,197\n5,267\n6,828\n4,074\nVBC Members\n84\n\u2014\n66\n\u2014\nOur key business and financial metrics are explained in detail below.\nRevenues\nRevenue is derived from license fees for the right to access our digital services, clinical service revenue from the provision of clinical services and\ncapitation revenue from the provision of VBC services.\nSoftware Licensing Revenue. Licensing revenue relates to a user obtaining a right to use and/or access our digital services. In these licensing\narrangements, we provide digital services to corporate entities, and these corporate entities are considered our customer since the contract is for services\nthat represent our ordinary business.\n227\nTable of Contents\nClinical Services Revenue. Clinical service revenue is represented by our provision of clinical services to business and private users. Clinical\nservice fees are based on per member per month (\u201cPMPM\u201d) subscription fees and fees per appointment (\u201cfee for service\u201d or \u201cFFS\u201d). PMPM subscription\nfees give members access to our clinical services over the contractual period as set forth in the arrangement and may be allocated to Licensing revenue.\nFee for service is based on contracted rates determined in agreed-upon compensation schedules.\nValue-Based Care Revenue. Value-based care revenue consists primarily of per capita fees for the delivery of VBC services under arrangements\nwith various customers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we are entitled to monthly PMPM fees to provide a defined range of VBC services to\nattributed members. PMPM fees are not dependent upon the volume of specific care services provided.\nPart of the consideration received under capitation revenue contracts is variable as the contracts contain provisions for performance-based\nincentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where amounts received are dependent upon factors such as quality metrics, member-specific\nattributes, and healthcare service costs. Capitation revenue is estimated using the most likely amount methodology and amounts are only included in\nrevenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. Such\nuncertainties may only be resolved several months after the end of the reporting period because of the availability of sufficient reliable data relating to\nfactors such as quality metrics, member specific attributes and healthcare service costs. Subsequent changes in capitation fees and the amount of\ncapitation revenue to be recognized by us are reflected in subsequent periods. The amount of variable capitation revenue recognized is expected to\nincrease as the number of members we provide VBC services to increases.\nExpenses are classified by relevant function:\nIn 2020, following the start of the VBC revenue stream, management reviewed the presentation of the consolidated statement of profit and loss and\nconsidered whether it continues to provide relevant and reliable information to stakeholders. It was concluded that there should be an update to how\ncertain expenses were classified and therefore the Group has changed its accounting policy for expense classifications. Previously, the Group had\ndisclosed Depreciation and Amortization as a separate expense category, whereas now Depreciation and Amortization costs are allocated to their relevant\nfunction. In addition, the Group elected to separately present costs of revenue relating to its Platform and application expenses, including the\namortization and impairment, and Research and development expenses, excluding the amortization and impairment, in its Consolidated Statement of Profit\nand Loss. The elective disaggregated presentation of amounts previously classified as Research & development and technology expenses was applied\nretrospectively to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of Care Delivery\nOur cost of care delivery primarily consists of fees paid to the physicians and other health professionals in our provider network and costs incurred\nin connection with our provider network operations. Cost of care delivery is mainly driven by patient activity and required medical services and are\nrelatively variable. Costs incurred relating to the delivery of VBC services is recorded as an expense within cost of care delivery when capitation revenue\nis recognized.\nPlatform & Application Expenses\nPlatform and application expenses are costs of revenue related to our digital healthcare platform. These costs primarily include employee-related\nsalaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and consultant expenses, for individuals that are engaged in providing professional\nservices related to support and maintenance of the digital healthcare platform, as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other direct\ncosts. It also includes amortization of capitalized development activities, including related amortization of tax credits.\nResearch & Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily included employee-related salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and\nconsultant expenses for individuals that are engaged in performing\n228\nTable of Contents\nactivities to develop and enhance the Group\u2019s digital healthcare platform as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other indirect\ncosts. Research costs and development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\nSales, General & Administrative Expenses\nSales, general & administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, contractors and consultants\u2019 expense, stock-based compensation,\nproperty and facility related expenses, IT and hosting, marketing, training and recruiting expenses. Enterprise IT and hosting costs are primarily software\nsubscriptions, domain and hosting costs. Our Sales, general & administrative expenses also include depreciation of property, fixtures and fittings and\namortization of acquired intangible assets.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nIn addition to our financial results reported in accordance with IFRS, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-IFRS\nfinancial measures, are useful in evaluating the performance of our business. We define EBITDA as profit (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization,\nnet finance income (costs), and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization, net finance income\n(costs), income taxes, share-based compensation, impairment expenses, foreign exchange gains or losses and gains (losses) on sale of subsidiaries.\nWe believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful metrics for investors to understand and evaluate our operating results and ongoing\nprofitability because it permits investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from our ongoing operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nhave certain limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS.\nWe caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar\nmeasures disclosed by other issuers, because some issuers calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, limiting their usefulness as\ndirect comparative measures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA from the most comparable IFRS measure, loss for the financial year,\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(amounts in thousands unless otherwise indicated)\nSix Months\nEnded June 30,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2020\n2019\nLoss for the financial year\n$(75,722)\n$(90,813)\n$\n(188,030)\n$\n(140,287)\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\n13,322\n6,459\n14,487\n2,496\nFinance costs and income\n2,215\n2,563\n3,920\n101\nTax (benefit)/ provision\n(2,493)\n2,937\n4,639\n(5,559)\nEBITDA\n(62,678)\n(78,854)\n(164,984)\n(143,249)\nShare-based compensation\n12,344\n433\n9,557\n7,966\nImpairment expense\n\u2014\n32\n6,436\n\u2014\nExchange loss/(gain)\n91\n2,146\n2,836\n(17,075)\n(Gain) on sale of subsidiary\n(3,917)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$(54,160)\n$(76,243)\n$\n(146,155)\n$\n(152,358)\nUsers\nUsers is the total number of members who have joined our digital platform and completed all mandatory fields on the digital platform. Once a\nmember is registered, Babylon has been able to capture member details and provides the member with access to Babylon\u2019s suite of digital services.\nGrowth in users in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was driven primarily by engagement from our VBC members and increases in the number of\nmembers receiving clinical services.\n229\nTable of Contents\nMembers\nMembers are the number of members for which we provide Clinical Services or Value-Based Care Services.\nVBC Members\nVBC Members are the number of members for which full cost risk of covered services is assumed under Value-Based Care arrangements.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue is derived from license fees for the right to access our digital services, clinical service revenue from the provision of clinical services and\ncapitation revenue from the provision of value-based care services.\nSoftware Licensing Revenue. The majority of revenue related to software licensing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term\nbeginning when the customer has access to the service. Revenue from software licensing arrangements with multiple performance obligations that is not\nrecognized on a straight-line basis is recognized when the performance obligations have been satisfied upon transfer of the service, typically a right to\nuse the service, to the customer. Any revenue relating to localization of services prior to the commencement of license term is not deemed to be distinct\nfrom the license contract and is subsequently also recognized over the license term. Efforts to satisfy performance obligations are expended evenly\nthroughout the performance period and so the performance obligation is satisfied evenly over time.\nClinical Services Revenue. Clinical service fees are based on PMPM (per member per month) subscription fees and fees per appointment. PMPM\nsubscription fees are recognized monthly based on the number of members covered by the plan in a given month and may be allocated to Licensing\nRevenue. Fee for service is recognized when the services are rendered at a point in time.\nValue-Based Care Revenue. Unlike clinical services revenue, we accept full financial risk for members attributed to our VBC services, which means\nwe are responsible for the cost of all covered services required by members.\nCost of Care Delivery\nOur cost of care delivery primarily consists of fees paid to the physicians and other health professionals in our provider network and costs incurred\nin connection with our provider network operations. Cost of care delivery is mainly driven by patient activity and required medical services and are\nrelatively variable. Costs incurred relating to the delivery of VBC services is recorded as an expense within cost of care delivery when value-based care\nrevenue is recognized.\nPlatform and application expenses\nPlatform and application expenses are costs of revenue related to our digital healthcare platform. These costs primarily include employee-related\nsalaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and consultant expenses, for individuals that are engaged in providing professional\nservices related to support and maintenance of the digital healthcare platform, as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other direct\ncosts. The amortization of capitalized development costs are also included in Platform and application expenses. We expect our Platform and application\nexpenses to increase commensurate with increased maintenance attributable to new contracts and continuing development of our Babylon technology\nplatform.\nResearch & development expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily included employee-related salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, as well as contractor and\nconsultant expenses, for individuals that are engaged in performing\n230\nTable of Contents\nactivities to develop and enhance the Group\u2019s digital healthcare platform as well as third-party application costs, hosting services and other indirect\ncosts. Research costs and development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. We expect our Research &\ndevelopment expenses to continue to increase commensurate with the continued development of our Babylon technology platform.\nSales, General & Administrative Expenses\nSales, general & administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, contractors and consultants\u2019 expense, stock-based compensation,\nproperty and facility related expenses, IT and hosting, marketing, training and recruiting expenses. Enterprise IT and hosting costs are primarily software\nsubscriptions, domain and hosting costs. Our Sales, general & administrative expenses also include depreciation of property, fixtures and fittings and\namortization of acquired intangible assets. We expect our Sales, general & administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to costs that\nwe incur as a new public company, as well as other costs associated with continuing to grow our business. However, we expect our Sales, general &\nadministrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over the next several years. Our Sales, general & administrative expenses may\nfluctuate as a percentage of our total revenue from period to period due to the number of consultations and number of assigned Babylon members of our\ntotal revenue and the timing and extent of our Sales, general & administrative expenses.\nResults of Operations- Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2020\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The drive in hiring\nresulted in an increase in recruitment fees of $1.1 million to $2.4 million for the six months ending June 30, 2021. Marketing costs increased by $1.3 million\ndriven by spend on direct mail in the U.S., software subscriptions costs increased by $2.8 million, and legal & professional fees increased by $3.1 million,\nlargely in relation to management service organization fees.

In addition to geographic expansion, we also\nlicensed the COVID-19 care assistant within the United Kingdom. In addition, licensing revenue increased by $4.1 million related to the COVID-19\nsymptom checker that was utilized across NHS trusts in Birmingham and Wolverhampton that was not deployed in 2019. While we expect these revenues\nrelated to the COVID-19 care assistant to decrease in 2021, we believe revenues from new and existing contracts to other healthcare services provided\nacross NHS trusts will at least partially offset this decline. It is not currently possible to quantify the direct impact of COVID-19 on our revenues and\nexpenses. We expect the demand for digital services to continue to grow even after the COVID-19 pandemic abates. Finally, $4.9 million of the increase\ncame from an increase in new users in the United States.\nTotal clinical services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $14.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $1.2\nmillion of the increase was due to the launch of our FFS offerings in various locations in the United States providing both general medicine and\nbehavioral health virtual appointments. $3.8 million of the increase was due to U.K. market organic membership growth in the Babylon GP at Hand\npopulation. In addition, an increase in private appointments contributed an additional $6.6 million in 2020 versus 2019. The remaining growth was\ncontributed by Canada and Rwanda services that continued to grow driven by demand for appointments.\nValue based care revenue commenced in 2020 following the launch of the Babylon 360 product in October 2020 in the United States.\nVariable revenue recognized from performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares was not material in 2020. We review our\nVBC capitation revenue contracts to assess whether any of them should be considered onerous contracts by applying the industry based guidance on\npremium deficiency reserves. None of our contracts were determined to be onerous contracts as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nCost of Care Delivery\n(USD in thousands unless otherwise indicated)\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020\n2019\n$\n%\nCost of care delivery\n(67,254)\n(19,810)\n(47,444)\n239.5%\nCost of care delivery increased by $47.4 million from $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $67.3 million for the year ended December\n31, 2020 primarily from an increase in physicians and other health professionals as a result of increased demand for clinical services and the launch of\nvalue-based care. Cost of care delivery in the United States increased by $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year\n236\nTable of Contents\nended December 31, 2019. This was the result of launching a 24-hour virtual clinical service and the secondary and tertiary care for value-based care\npatients. Costs also increased by $5.1 million following greater demand for private appointments in the United Kingdom and growth in Babylon GP at\nHand membership, resulting in increased costs relating to physicians and other health professionals. In Canada, patient demand for appointments grew,\nphysicians\u2019 costs resulted in $4.1 million higher costs in 2020 than 2019. The other drivers of cost of care delivery were the cost of support and\nmanagement role, which increased by $9.3 million and were necessary in the expansion of services in the United States and greater breadth of care across\ndifferent clinician types in the United Kingdom. During the year ended December 31, 2020, claims expense included in Cost of care delivery was $11.9\nmillion, of which $7.6 million had been paid as of December 31, 2020.

This increase\nwas primarily due to a reallocation of resources between Research and development and Platform & application activities within our technology\noperations during 2020. Depreciation and amortization included in Platform & application expenses was $11.1 million in 2020, a $9.9 million increase when\ncompared to 2019. In addition, following an assessment of the future development of our technology, capitalized development costs were impaired by $6.4\nmillion in 2020. This impairment was primarily the result of the discontinuation of certain features in 2020 surrounding a proprietary data structure for\nencounters on our software platform that were deemed to be no longer technologically feasible.\nResearch & Development Expenses\n(USD in thousands unless otherwise indicated)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nVariance\n2020\n2019\n$\n%\nResearch & development expenses\n(35,524)\n(51,205)\n15,681\n(30.6)\nResearch & development expenses decreased by $15.7 million from $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $35.5 million for the year\nended December 31, 2021.

Included\nwithin people costs, contractors & consultants expense was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was a decrease of $12 million on the\nyear ended December 31, 2019. As referred to above, this decrease was primarily due to a reallocation of the resources between Research and\ndevelopment and Platform & application activities within our technology operations during 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, development\ncosts of approximately $43,027 were capitalized. The development costs that were capitalized during the year were those direct costs related to our\ndevelopment and technology operations that were deemed technologically feasible and probable of generating future economic benefits. This decrease\nwas partly offset by an increase in share based-compensation expense of $5.2 million when compared to 2019.\nSales, General & Administrative Expenses\n(USD in thousands unless otherwise indicated)\nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2020\n2019\n$\n%\nSales, general & administrative expenses\n(103,341)\n(90,891)\n(12,450)\n13.7%\n237\nTable of Contents\nPersonnel costs within Sales, general & administrative expenses increased to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $9.0\nmillion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, following increases in commercial and support services headcount to align to the business\ngrowth. In addition, the acquisition of FCMG and the deployment of the Babylon product into new markets resulted in professional fees increasing by\n$4.7 million. In addition, higher people costs and IT-related expenses increased to $20.2 million, a $3.6 million or 21.7% increase compared to 2019.\nPremises costs decreased by $2.2 million following our vacating our London East office and reduced service and business rates as a result of an increase\nin remote working following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our tax (provision) / benefit in both periods is significantly impacted by our inability to recognize deferred tax assets relating\nto most of our losses. The change in tax (provision)/benefit is primarily the reversal of previously recognized tax benefits of $4.3 million related to U.K. tax\ncredits for qualifying Research and development activities, which will be amortized over the useful life of the related capitalized development costs as a\nreduction to Platform & application expenses, as discussed further in Note 2 to the Babylon Holdings audited consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of funds has been proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt and equity.

We require and will continue to need significant cash\nresources to, among other things, fund our working capital requirements,\n238\nTable of Contents\nincrease our headcount, make capital expenditures (including those related to product development), and expand our business through acquisitions. Our\nfuture capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the cost of future acquisitions, our ability to provide more affordable healthcare, the\nscale of our increases in headcount, and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts. Based upon our forecasts through\nthe period ending December 31, 2022, we are expecting to consummate the Business Combination and believe that the capital raised will be sufficient to\nprovide adequate funding to service our obligations, meet liquidity needs and fund necessary capital expenditures through this forecast period. In the\nevent that we are unable to consummate the Business Combination we believe that we will be required to seek additional funding through public or\nprivate equity or debt financings to continue our operations. While there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be consummated or, in the\nevent that the Business Combination is not consummated, that additional funds are available to us on acceptable terms, we believe that we will be\nsuccessful in raising the additional capital we need to be able to meet our liabilities as they fall due over the period ending December 31, 2022.\nAs of June 30, 2021, Babylon Holdings\u2019 cash and cash equivalents totaled $42.4 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming consummation of the\nBusiness Combination on or before December 3, 2021, the transaction is expected to deliver up to $575 million in gross proceeds, including $345 million in\ngross proceeds from cash held in Alkuri\u2019s trust account, assuming no redemptions. In addition, the Business Combination is further supported by a $230\nmillion PIPE Investment. In addition, and as discussed above in the \u201c\u2014Overview\u201d section, Babylon Holdings previously acquired an option to purchase\nHigi, a consumer health engagement company, and intends to acquire the remaining equity it does not already own, which will reduce Babylon Holdings\u2019\ncash needs by approximately $40 million. Assuming no redemptions, and taking transaction costs and strategic investments into account, Babylon is\nexpected to have approximately $540 million in cash and cash equivalents assuming no redemptions by Alkuri Stockholders, which amount will be\ndependent on the extent of redemptions by Alkuri as of the Closing, and other factors.\nBabylon Holdings had originally anticipated agreement on the Business Combination several months earlier than it was originally agreed due to\nmarket conditions. As such, it has subsequently obtained bridge financing to address short-term cash flow needs pending consummation of the\nBusiness Combination. Accordingly, on July 15, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a loan agreement with VNV Group for $15.0 million. The interest rate\non the loan is 14%.\nOn August 18, 2021, Babylon Holdings issued $50.0 million in unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (\u201cUnsecured Bonds\u201d), including the non-\ncash conversion of $8.0 million in borrowings under the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The\ninterest rate on the loan is 10%, with interest payable quarterly. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company utilized proceeds of $7.2 million from the Unsecured Bonds to settle the remainder of the loan and interest with VNV (Cyprus) Limited. Cash\nproceeds from the bond issuance, net of discounts, repayments of borrowings, and transaction expenses total approximately $32.1 million. The\nUnsecured Bonds have a one-year term and they can be redeemed by Babylon Holdings at any time. Payment of the bonds is mandatory upon\ncompletion of a business combination or change in control. Babylon Holdings must maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million to comply with\nfinancial covenants.\nBabylon is considering market conditions including the possibility of requests for redemptions by Alkuri stockholders in connection with the\nBusiness Combination. Babylon has engaged Ardea and Citi to explore potential additional sources of funding to supplement the combined Company\u2019s\ncash balance following the Closing. Babylon is evaluating obtaining debt financing with a principal ranging between $100 million and $200 million to be\nentered into concurrently with or shortly after the Closing on customary terms, which may include security interests, restrictive covenants and/or\nwarrants for the purchase of shares of Babylon. Further, depending on the timing of the Closing, Babylon may seek to negotiate a modification of the\nterms of the Unsecured Bonds in order to issue additional Unsecured Bonds, to increase Babylon\u2019s borrowing capacity by up to $25m. See \u201cRisk Factors\n\u2014Risks Related to Babylon\u2019s Business and Operations Following the Business Combination\u2014We may require additional capital to support business\ngrowth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\u201d\n239\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table discloses our consolidated cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods\npresented:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nYears Ended December 31,\n(USD in thousands)\n2021\n2020\n2020\n2019\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$(19,466)\n$(87,391)\n$ (143,430)\n$ (143,614)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(35,313)\n(23,591)\n(72,226)\n(36,936)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n(4,485)\n(13,007)\n100,058\n352,521\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n(59,264)\n(123,989)\n(115,598)\n171,971\nCash and cash equivalents beginning of the year\n101,757\n214,888\n214,888\n46,031\nEffect of exchange rates\n(112)\n(703)\n2,467\n(3,114)\nCash and cash equivalents end of the year\n$\n42,381\n$\n90,196\n$ 101,757\n$\n214,888\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $19.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash used in operating activities of\n$87.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of approximately $67.9 million. The Loss for the period after adjusting for non-cash items\ndecreased by $23.1 million, from $75.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $52.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This decrease\nwas increased by the net effect of changes in working capital of $44.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $143.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in operating activities of\n$143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. Net loss for the financial year, after adjusting for non-cash\nitems, decreased by $7.3 million, from $152.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This\ndecrease was largely offset by the unfavorable net effect of changes in working capital of $7.1 million.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $35.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash used in investing activities of\n$23.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of $5.0 million investment in\nHigi and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $14.0 million relating to an acquisition consummated in April 2021.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of\n$36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of the $10.0 million investment\nin Higi and cash paid for acquisitions of $25.7 million relating to the acquisition of FCMG.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $4.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net cash provided by financing activities\nof $13.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in Net cash provided by financing activities of $8.5 million is primarily the result of\nfees paid directly attributable to the equity raise in the six months ended June 30, 2020 of $10.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing\nactivities of $352.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n240\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of $242.4 million is primarily the result of higher gross proceeds from the issuance of share\ncapital of $308.2 million during 2019, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of convertible loan notes in 2020 of $48.9 million, as well as the\nrepayment of convertible loans of $14.8 million in 2019, whereas Babylon Holdings did not have any repayments on borrowings during 2020.\nFunding Requirements\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 directors performed a going concern assessment for a period of twelve months from the date of approval of these financial\nstatements. This assessment indicates that additional funding, which the directors expect to obtain through the consummation of the Business\nCombination, is required to provide sufficient funds to meet our liabilities as they fall due for that period. As of December 31, 2020 the Group had a net\nasset position of $48.4 million (as of December 31, 2019: $173.8 million), including cash and cash equivalents of $101.8 million (as of December 31, 2019:\n$214.9 million). For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had a net asset position of $58.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.4 million.\nWhile there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be consummated or, in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, that\nadditional funds are available to us on acceptable terms, we believe that we will be successful in raising the additional capital we need to meet our\nworking capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this report. Based on this, we believe it\nremains appropriate to prepare our financial statements on a going concern basis.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments. The commitments result\nprimarily from operating leases. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2021:\nPayments due by Period\n2021\n(remainder\nof year)\n2022\n-\n2023\n2024\n-\n2025\nThereafter\nOperating lease obligations\n1,206\n9,581\n4,422\n1,377\nBorrowings\n473\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships,\nsuch as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-\nbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to the financing, liquidity, market or credit\nrisk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our financial statements\nbecause the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, which could have a material impact on our financial\nstatements if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if our assumptions were to change. The following accounting policies include\nestimates that require management\u2019s subjective or complex judgments about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. For information on our\nsignificant accounting policies, including the policies discussed below, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus.\n241\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nCertain of the Group\u2019s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. The Group assesses the services\npromised in a contract and identifies distinct or bundled performance obligations in the contract. Identification of these performance obligations involves\njudgement to determine the promises and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such promises. If multiple performance obligations are\nidentified in the contract the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the\nGroup recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. Significant judgment is required to determine the\nstand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and the determination may not always be discernible from past transactions or other\nobservable evidence. We utilize several inputs when determining stand-alone selling price, including the price of services sold on a standalone basis, our\noverall pricing strategies, the cost of providing the service, market data and the geographic locations in which the service is provided.\nFor revenue related to value based care arrangements, Babylon Holdings has determined that a portion of the transaction price under capitation\nrevenue contracts is variable as the contracts contain provisions for performance-based incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares where\namounts received are dependent upon factors such as quality metrics, member-specific attributes, and healthcare service costs. The variable portion of\ncapitation revenue is estimated using the most likely amount methodology and amounts are only included in revenue to the extent that it is highly\nprobable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur once any uncertainty is resolved. Capitation revenue is recognized gross when it\nis assessed that the performance obligation relates to the whole of the patient journey with Babylon Holdings responsible for arranging, providing and\ncontrolling the VBC services provided to the attributed members, with expenses payable to other healthcare providers recorded in cost of care delivery.\nThis is a significant judgment when assessing the performance obligation.\nCapitalization of Development Costs\nWe capitalize expenditures for the development of technology to the extent that it is expected to meet the criteria in accordance with IAS 38,\nIntangible Assets (\u201cIAS 38\u201d). The decision to capitalize is based on significant judgments made by management, including the technical feasibility of\ncompleting the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale and assumptions used to demonstrate that the asset will generate probable\nfuture economic benefits (e.g., projected cash flow projections, discount rate). Development costs of $43.0 million (2019: $36.0 million) were capitalized in\nthe year based on a model whereby a percentage is allocated to employee related expenses based on the time spent on the development of assets. All\nemployee expenses included in this balance relate to employees in the technology departments, and the percentage attributable varies depending on the\nnature of the work performed and the type of asset being developed.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nThe carrying values of our long-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. If any indication exists, then the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated. Determining the\nrecoverable amount is subjective and requires management to estimate future growth, profitability, discount and terminal growth rates, and project future\ncash flows, among other factors. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may\nresult in changes to our estimates of future cash flows.\nIf we conclude that a definite or indefinite long-lived intangible asset is impaired, we recognize a loss in an amount equal to the excess of the\ncarrying value of the asset over its fair value at the date of impairment. The fair value at the date of the impairment becomes the new cost basis and will\nresult in a lower depreciation expense than for periods before the asset\u2019s impairment.\nConsolidation\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the \u201cGroup\u201d) has control. The Group controls an entity when\nthe Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its\n242\nTable of Contents\ninvolvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. To determine whether the\nGroup controls an entity, status of voting or similar rights, contractual arrangements and other specific factors are considered. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date on which that control ceases.\nWe hold certain rights in the form of purchase options to acquire additional equity interests in entities that we have an existing shareholding in.\nThese rights are assessed as either substantive or protective in nature to conclude whether we exercise control over the entity. This assessment requires\njudgment relating to both the barriers that may prevent, and the extent to which we would benefit from, exercise of those rights and determines whether\nwe should consolidate the entity.\nIn addition, we consolidate certain professional service corporations (\u201cPCs\u201d) which are owned, directly or indirectly, and operated by appropriately\nlicensed physicians. We maintain control of these PCs through contractual arrangements, which can include service agreements, financing agreements,\nequity transfer restriction agreements, and employment agreements, or a combination thereof, which are primarily established during the formation of the\nPCs. At inception, the contractual framework established between the Group and the PCs provides the Group with the power to direct the relevant\nactivities in the conduct of the PC\u2019s non-clinical administrative and other non-clinical business activities. The physicians employed by the PC are\nexclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for their patients. Babylon Healthcare NJ, PC, Babylon Healthcare,\nPLLC, Marcus Zachary, DO, OC, California Telemedicine Associates, PC, Babylon Healthcare, PC, and Babylon Healthcare NC, PC employ healthcare\nproviders to deliver primary care services to VBC members and users of the digital platform. These PCs are consolidated on the basis of control through\ncontractual arrangements.\nThe following provides summary financial data for the PCs that are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements:\nJune\n30, 2021\nDecember\n31, 2020\nTotal assets\n66,489\n$\n35,535\nTotal liabilities\n81,429\n42,699\nSix\nMonths\nEnded\nJune\n30, 2021\nFor the\nYear\nEnded\nDecember\n31, 2020\nRevenue\n35,786\n$\n17,436\nOperating expenses:\nCost of care delivery\n36,710\n20,175\nSales, general & administrative expenses\n4,404\n3,799\nTotal operating expenses\n41,114\n$ 23,973\nThere were no activities related to the PCs in 2019.\nQualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position\ndue to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs\nwere to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could\nharm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCredit risk\nOur cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and loans with banks and financial institutions are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. We\nplace cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that\n243\nTable of Contents\nmanagement believes are of high credit quality. We seek to limit our credit risk with respect to customers by implementing due diligence procedures on all\ncustomers. We manage credit risk through receiving cash payment for large contracts up front in some instances, in addition to contracting with\ngovernment funded entities which subsequently carries lower risks.\nCurrency risk\nWhile our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we operate internationally and are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, specifically British\nPound Sterling. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in\nexchange rates. We manage our currency risk through natural hedges (offsetting of receivables and payables) in addition to implementing investment\nprocedures. Several of our consolidated entities operate in foreign countries and therefore, their net assets are exposed to the risk associated with\ntranslating foreign currencies.\nInterest rate risk\nAs of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $42.4 million and $101.8 million, respectively, which\nconsisted primarily of money market accounts, which carries a degree of interest rate risk. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.\nImplications of being an \u201cEmerging Growth Company\u201d and a \u201cForeign Private Issuer\u201d\nEach of Alkuri and Babylon Holdings is, and consequently, following the Business Combination, Babylon will be, an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d\nas defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, Babylon will\nbe eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not\n\u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in their periodic reports and\nproxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of\nany golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find Babylon\u2019s securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active\ntrading market for Babylon\u2019s securities and the prices of Babylon\u2019s securities may be more volatile.\nBabylon will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the\nclosing of the Alkuri IPO, (b) in which Babylon has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which Babylon is deemed to be a large\naccelerated filer, which means the market value of Babylon\u2019s common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day\nof its most recently completed second fiscal quarter\u037e and (ii) the date on which Babylon has issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities during the prior three-year period. References herein to \u201cemerging growth company\u201d have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\nBabylon Holdings is also considered a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d and will report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with \u201cforeign private\nissuer\u201d status. This means that, even after Babylon Holdings no longer qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as long as it qualifies as a \u201cforeign\nprivate issuer\u201d under the Exchange Act, it will be exempt from certain provisions of and intends to take advantage certain exemptions from the Exchange\nAct that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including:\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under\nthe Exchange Act\u037e\n\u2022\nthe sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for\ninsiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time\u037e and\n244\nTable of Contents\nBabylon Holdings may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until such time as it is no longer a \u201cforeign private issuer.\u201d Babylon Holdings\ncould lose its status as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 outstanding voting\nsecurities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of the Babylon Holding\u2019s\ndirectors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents\u037e (ii) more than 50% of Babylon Holdings\u2019 assets are located in the United States\u037e or (iii)\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 business is administered principally in the United States.\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. Babylon Holdings has taken advantage of reduced\nreporting requirements in this proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus may be different\nfrom the information you receive from Babylon Holdings\u2019 competitors that are public companies, or other public companies in which you have made an\ninvestment. We expect to lose our foreign private issuer status for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of increased contacts with the United\nStates.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement/prospectus.\n245\nTable of Contents",

The unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial information presents the pro forma effects of the following transactions:\n\u2022\nthe Business Combination\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Higi acquisition. As described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Babylon Holdings has an option to acquire Higi. See \u201c\u2014\nDescription of the Business Combination.\u201d\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of financial position as of June 30, 2021 (\u201cPro Forma Statement of Financial Position\u201d)\ngive pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they were consummated on June 30, 2021. The unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive loss (\u201cPro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss\u201d) for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and six months ended June 30, 2021 give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition as if they had occurred\non January 1, 2020. The pro forma statements of financial position do not purport to represent, and are not necessarily indicative of, what the actual\nfinancial condition of Babylon would have been had the Business Combination and Higi acquisition taken place on June 30, 2021, as applicable, nor are\nthey indicative of the financial condition of Babylon as of any future date. The pro forma statements of profit and loss do not purport to represent, and\nare not necessarily indicative of, what the actual results of operations of Babylon would have been had the Business Combination and Higi acquisition\ntaken place on January 1, 2020, as applicable, nor are they indicative of the results of operations of Babylon for any future period. The unaudited pro\nforma adjustments represent management\u2019s estimates based on information available as of the date of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses are performed.\nThis information should be read together with the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of each of Alkuri, Babylon Holdings and\nHigi, including the notes thereto, as well as the disclosures contained in the sections titled \u201cBabylon\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cAlkuri\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d\nand other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the following\nhistorical financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus:\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\nHigi\u2019s historical unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nHigi\u2019s historical audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021\u037e and\n246Table of Contents\n\u2022\nAlkuri\u2019s historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. As a newly incorporated\nbusiness on December 1, 2020, the results of Alkuri prior to January 1, 2021 were not material.\nThe historical consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in its presentation currency of\nUSD. The historical financial statements of Alkuri and Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of USD. In the\ncase of Alkuri and Higi, adjustments were made to conform the U.S. GAAP financial statements to IFRS. Accordingly, pro forma adjustments have been\nreflected to conform the basis of accounting and accounting policies for Alkuri and Higi to those of Babylon Holdings. The historical consolidated\nfinancial statements of Higi have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its presentation currency of USD and have been adjusted to give effect\nto material differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nDescription of the Business Combination\nBabylon Holdings entered into the Merger Agreement, dated June 3, 2021, by and among Babylon Holdings, Merger Sub, Alkuri and the Sponsor,\nwhich, among other things, provides for Merger Sub to be merged with and into Alkuri with Alkuri being the surviving company and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Babylon (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). For more information about the Business Combination, please see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement.\u201d\nOn May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a network\nof Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on a fully diluted\nbasis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all proposed\ninvestments, it will hold over 25% of Higi\u2019s shareholdings on a fully diluted basis.\nOn June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a letter agreement (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d) with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest\nshareholders in Higi. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon\u2019s option to purchase the remaining\nshares of Higi will be exercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon would provide\nregistration rights to such shareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley agreed to\nbe paid in shares of Babylon Holdings in lieu of cash.\nThe contemplated consideration for the Higi acquisition is $70.3 million. Accordingly, the parties expect to issue up to 6.4 million shares of Babylon\nHoldings as the consideration in the transaction, with each share of Babylon Holdings to be valued at $10 per share although shareholders other than\n7Wire, Flare and Wrigley may elect to accept cash in lieu of shares. Because of the agreement reached in the Letter Agreement, Babylon Holdings will\nissue at least 3.9 million shares of Babylon Holdings as the consideration in the transaction. In connection with the Higi acquisition, certain continuing\nemployees, as determined by Babylon, will receive restricted stock units granted in respect of Babylon Class A Shares (\u201cBabylon RSUs\u201d), valued at $10.\nBabylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon Holdings. As such, the historical\nfinancial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma Statement of Financial Position assumes\nthat the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss assumes that the Higi acquisition occurred on\nJanuary 1, 2020.\nAccounting for the Business Combination\nThe Business Combination with Alkuri will be accounted for as a merger in accordance with IFRS. Under this method of accounting, Alkuri will be\ntreated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company for financial reporting purposes.\n247\nTable of Contents\nBabylon Holdings has accounted for its acquisition of Alkuri as a Business Combination because Babylon is considered the accounting acquirer. This\ndetermination was primarily based on the assumptions that Babylon Holdings\u2019 shareholders will hold a majority of the voting power of Babylon, Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 operations will substantially comprise the ongoing operations of Babylon, Babylon Holdings\u2019 designees are expected to comprise a majority of\nthe governing body of Babylon, and Babylon Holdings\u2019 senior management will comprise the senior management of Babylon. Because Alkuri does not\nmeet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations (\u201cIFRS 3\u201d) (\u201cIFRS 3\u201d), and the net assets of Alkuri primarily comprise\ncash and cash equivalents, the Business Combination is accounted for as a Business Combination whereby the net assets of Alkuri will be stated at\nhistorical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. However, any excess of the share consideration issued by Babylon over the fair\nvalue of Alkuri\u2019s identifiable net assets acquired represents compensation for the service of a share exchange listing for its shares and is expensed as\nincurred in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payment (\u201cIFRS 2\u201d). Accordingly, the excess of the fair value of the share consideration in excess of the\nnet book value of the assets of Alkuri has been reflected as a recapitalization transaction expense in the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss.\nOperations prior to the Business Combination will be deemed to be those of Babylon Holdings.\nBasis of Pro Forma Presentation\nThe adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to provide an\nunderstanding of Babylon upon consummation of the Business Combination and the Higi acquisition.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X\nas amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 \u201cAmendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.\u201d Release No. 33-\n10786 replaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction (\u201cTransaction\nAccounting Adjustments\u201d) and present the reasonably estimable synergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected\nto occur (\u201cManagement\u2019s Adjustments\u201d). Babylon Holdings has elected not to present Management\u2019s Adjustments and will only be presenting\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different\nhad the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as being indicative\nof the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that Babylon will achieve. Babylon\nand Alkuri have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to eliminate\nactivities between the companies.\nThe following summarizes the consideration:\n(in thousands, except for share amounts)\nShares transferred at Closing\n336,427,107\nValue per share(1)\n$\n10.00\nTotal Share Consideration\n$\n3,364,271\n(1)\nShare Consideration is calculated using a $10.00 reference price. Actual total Share Consideration\nwill be dependent on the value of Alkuri Common Stock at Closing.\n248\nTable of Contents\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming two alternative levels of redemption into cash of\nAlkuri Common Stock:\n\u2022\nScenario 1 \u2013 Assuming no redemptions for cash: This presentation assumes that no Alkuri Stockholders exercise redemption rights with\nrespect to their shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon consummation of the Business Combination\u037e and\n\u2022\nScenario 2 \u2013 Assuming redemptions of 34,500,000 of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash: This presentation assumes that Alkuri\nStockholders exercise their redemption rights with respect to a maximum of 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon\nconsummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of approximately $10.00 per share. The maximum redemption amount\nreflects the redemption of all outstanding Alkuri Class A Common Stock given the minimum requirements in the Merger Agreement of $230\nmillion of cash held either in or outside of the trust account, including the aggregate amount of any proceeds from the PIPE Investment,\nafter giving effect to the payments to redeeming Alkuri Stockholders. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in Scenario 1 and\npresents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of maximum redemptions.\nAfter the Closing, assuming no redemptions of shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock for cash, Alkuri Stockholders and the Sponsor will own\n9.8% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Shares and 1,300,000 shares from the PIPE Investment), the PIPE Investors will own\napproximately 5.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (including shares purchased by the Founder, Sponsor and certain existing Babylon Holdings\nshareholders in the PIPE Investment) and the existing shareholders of Babylon Holdings will own approximately 85.0% of the outstanding Babylon\nShares. Additionally, the capitalization table includes Earnout Class A Shares issued to the Sponsor of 0.3% and Earnout Class B Shares issued to the\nFounder of 8.8%. Assuming redemption by holders of all 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock, the Sponsor will own approximately 1.8% of\nthe outstanding Babylon Shares, the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.7% of outstanding Babylon Shares and the existing shareholders of\nBabylon Holdings will own approximately 92.2% of the outstanding Babylon Shares (in each case, not giving effect to any shares purchased by the\nFounder, the Sponsor and existing Babylon Holdings shareholders in the PIPE Investment and any shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of\nwarrants or options outstanding). The Sponsor will own an additional 0.3% of the outstanding Babylon shares and the Founder will own an additional\n9.5% of the outstanding Babylon shares as a result of the Earnout Class A and B Shares issued and outstanding.\nThe foregoing does not reflect the effect of the exercise of the 5,933,333 private placement warrants held by the Sponsor or the 8,625,000 public\nwarrants. Assuming all of the private placement warrants and public warrants are exercised and the earnout milestones are met such that the Earnout\nShares are not subject to the repurchase right, (i) there would be a total of 441,352,107 shares of Babylon Holdings outstanding (assuming no\nredemptions) and (ii) there would be a total of 406,852,107 shares of Babylon Holdings (assuming maximum redemptions).\nAssuming No Redemptions\nAssuming Maximum Redemptions\nShares\n% of Total\nOutstanding\n% of\nTotal\nVoting\nPower\nShares\n% of Total\nOutstanding\n% of\nTotal\nVoting\nPower\nBabylon shareholders \u2013 Class A\n295,589,531\n66.9%\n18.9%\n295,589,531\n72.7%\n19.4%\nBabylon shareholders \u2013 Class B\n40,837,576\n9.3%\n39.4%\n40,837,576\n10.0%\n40.3%\nEarnout shares \u2013 Class A\n1,293,750\n0.3%\n0.1%\n1,293,750\n0.3%\n0.1%\nEarnout shares \u2013 Class B\n38,800,000\n8.8%\n37.4%\n38,800,000\n9.5%\n38.2%\nAlkuri Public Shares\n34,500,000\n7.8%\n2.2%\n\u2014\n0.0%\n0.0%\nSponsor Shares(1)\n7,331,250\n1.7%\n0.5%\n7,331,250\n1.8%\n0.5%\nPIPE(2)\n23,000,000\n5.2%\n1.5%\n23,000,000\n5.7%\n1.5%\nTotal\n441,352,107\n100.0%\n100.0%\n406,852,107\n100.0%\n100.0%\n(1)\nDoes not include 1,300,000 shares being subscribed for by the Sponsor and its affiliates as described in the following footnote. When including the\nshares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE\n249\nTable of Contents\nInvestment, the Sponsor is expected to own approximately 2.0% of the outstanding shares and 0.6% of the total voting power assuming no\nredemptions and approximately 2.1% of the outstanding shares and 0.6% of the total voting power assuming maximum redemptions.\n(2)\nIncludes 200,000 shares purchased by the Founder, 1,300,000 shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates, and 1,000,000 shares purchased by\ncertain existing Babylon Holdings shareholders in the PIPE Investment.\nFurther, the Founder will hold 76,512,016 Babylon Class A Shares and all 79,637,576 Babylon Class B Shares under both redemption scenarios,\nincluding 200,000 Babylon Class A Shares purchased in the PIPE Investment and the Stockholder Earnout Shares. When excluding the shares purchased\nby the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment, the PIPE Investors are expected to own approximately 4.9% of the outstanding shares and 1.4%\nof the total voting power assuming no redemptions and approximately 5.3% of the outstanding shares and 1.4% of the total voting power assuming\nmaximum redemptions.\nThe following table sets forth the historical comparative per share information for Babylon and Alkuri on a stand-alone basis and pro forma\ncombined per share information after giving effect to the Business Combination, (1) assuming no Alkuri Stockholders exercise redemption rights with\nrespect to their shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock upon the Closing of the Business Combination\u037e and (2) assuming that Alkuri Stockholders\nexercise their redemption rights with respect to a maximum of 34,500,000 shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock as of Closing of the Business\nCombination.\nCombined Pro Forma\nBabylon

842, Leases, which becomes effective for private companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. In\naccordance with IFRS 16, Leases\u00b8 and Babylon\u2019s accounting policies, right of use assets of $1.2 million and lease liabilities of $1.8 million have been\nrecognized in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2021. In addition, accrued rent liabilities of $0.3 million have been derecognized from the balance\nsheet as of June 30, 2021. The impact of the adjustments to the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.\n3.)\nUnder U.S. GAAP, Higi elected to apply the straight-line approach for graded vesting when measuring share- based payment awards. Under IFRS,\nBabylon would use the graded vesting method, resulting in a higher proportion of cost being allocated to the earlier years. The impact of the\nadjustments on the statement of operations and deferred taxes was not material.\nNote 2. Preliminary Allocation of Purchase Price\nOn May 15, 2020, Babylon Holdings acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock in Higi, a provider of digital healthcare services via a network\nof Smart Health Stations located in the United States. Through a series of investments, Babylon Holdings increased their shareholdings on a fully diluted\nbasis in Higi to 18.5% as of December 31, 2020 and has the option to continue investing such that if Babylon Holdings completes all proposed\ninvestments, it will hold over 25% of Higi\u2019s shareholdings on a fully diluted basis.\n261\nTable of Contents\nOn June 2, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into the Letter Agreement with each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley, the three largest shareholders in Higi.\nPursuant to the Letter Agreement, Babylon and such shareholders agreed that (i) Babylon\u2019s option to purchase the remaining shares of Higi will be\nexercisable until the earlier of 30 days following completion of this offering and December 31, 2021, (ii) Babylon would provide registration rights to such\nshareholders at least as favorable to those being offered to PIPE Investors, and (iii) each of 7Wire, Flare and Wrigley agreed to be paid in shares of\nBabylon Holdings in lieu of cash.\nBabylon Holdings has deemed the exercise of the option to be probable, which exercise would be significant to Babylon Holdings. As such, the\nhistorical financial information has been adjusted to provide the pro forma effect to the Higi acquisition. The Pro Forma Statement of Financial Position\nassumes that the Higi acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2020 and the Pro Forma Statement of Profit and Loss assumes that the Higi acquisition\noccurred on January 1, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, the total shareholding was 19.0% and 25%, respectively.\nThe transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS and\nassuming Babylon Holdings closed the Higi acquisition by purchasing the remaining 75% for estimated consideration with a fair value of approximately\n$70.3 million. The Higi acquisition was achieved in stages, which required Babylon Holdings to remeasure its previously held equity interest in Higi at its\nacquisition date fair value. As no material control premium was determined to exist, estimated consideration transferred to acquire the remaining stake in\nHigi was used to estimate the fair value of Babylon Holdings\u2019 previously held equity interest. This remeasurement resulted in gains of approximately $14.6\nmillion and $ 10.8 million, which recorded in Other (income) expense within Babylon Holdings\u2019 pro forma consolidated statement of profit and loss for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred and the preliminary estimated fair values of the major classes of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired has been determined using prior\nacquisitions as a benchmark for the purposes of a preliminary purchase price allocation.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation (in 000s)\nCash consideration\n$\n5,202\nShares issued as consideration\n53,553\nFair value of existing equity interest\n23,440\nAdditional consideration\n11,565\nTotal consideration transferred\n93,760\nTrade and other receivables\n2,837\nPrepayments and contract assets\n294\nOther intangible assets\n31,837\nTrade and other payables and Accruals and provisions\n(2,303)\nOther assets and liabilities, net\n4,685\nNet Assets Acquired\n37,350\nAmount Allocated to Goodwill\n$56,410\nThe goodwill allocation of $56.4 million reflects expectations of favorable future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies through the scale of\nour combined operations, and the assembled workforce.\n262\nTable of Contents\nPro Forma Adjustments\nThe following pro forma adjustments were added to give effect to Higi acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.\n(AA)\nReflects the elimination of the previous investment related to Higi of $12.6 million and the step up to the fair value of prior existing equity interest\nof $23.4 million. This step-up in fair value resulted in a gain of $10.8 million.\n(BB)\nTo reflect the elimination of Higi\u2019s historical equity.\n(CC)\nTo reflect the consideration payment in the form of $5.2 million in cash, shares issued as consideration with an estimated fair value of $53.6 million,\nfair value of existing equity interest of $23.4 million and $11.6 million in deferred consideration at fair value, resulting in an addition of goodwill of\n$56.4 million and $53.6 million in additional paid capital.\n(DD)\nTo reflect the elimination of historical intangible assets of $0.2 million along with the fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $31.9 million\nalong with its respective impact on Deferred Tax Liabilities of $6.1 million. This results in a reduction of the addition to goodwill by $25.8 million.\nOur preliminary estimate of the weighted average useful lives of the acquired intangible assets was determined to be 7.0 years based on the useful\nlives assigned to comparable historical acquisitions. The amortization of the intangible assets over a 7.0 year period resulted in an expense of $4.5\nmillion and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively.\n(EE)\nThis adjustment is to reflect the payment of Higi\u2019s debt using its cash on hand. If the cash on hand is not sufficient, part of the consideration\ntransferred will be used to settle the Related party convertible notes at Closing. This results in a reduction in the cash balance of $5.5 million,\nelimination of $7.0 million of debt and a reduction of goodwill by $1.5 million.\n263\nTable of Contents",

For so long as we\nqualify as a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act and the NYSE corporate governance rules that are\napplicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including:\n\u2022\nExemption from filing quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other specified information or current reports on\nForm 8-K upon the occurrence of specified significant events\u037e\n\u2022\nExemption from the requirement to comply with Regulation FD, which regulates selective disclosure of material non-public information by\nissuers\u037e\n\u2022\nExemption from Section 16 under the Exchange Act, which requires insiders to file public reports of their securities ownership and trading\nactivities and provides for liability for insiders who profit from trades in a short period of time\u037e\n\u2022\nExemption from the NYSE rules applicable to domestic issuers requiring disclosure within four business days of any determination to grant\na waiver of the code of business conduct and ethics to directors and officers\u037e\n\u2022\nExemption from the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain issuances of securities, including shareholder approval of share\noption plans\u037e\n\u2022\nExemption from the requirement that our audit committee have review and oversight responsibilities over all \u201crelated party transactions,\u201d as\ndefined in Item 7.B of Form 20-F\u037e\n\u2022\nExemption from the requirement that our board of directors have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities\u037e and\n\u2022\nExemption from the requirements that director nominees are selected, or recommended for selection by our board of directors, either by (i)\nindependent directors constituting a majority of our board\u2019s independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate,\nor (ii) a committee comprised solely of independent directors, and that a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing\nthe nominations process is adopted.\nAccordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning our business than there would be if we were a U.S. domestic public\ncompany and our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate\ngovernance requirements of the NYSE. We may utilize these exemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a foreign private issuer.\nWe intend to comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules applicable to foreign private issuers, which means that we are permitted to follow\ncertain corporate governance rules that conform to Jersey law requirements in lieu of many of the NYSE corporate governance rules. We may utilize these\nexemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a foreign private issuer.\nComposition of our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors is currently composed of five members, consisting of Dr. Parsadoust, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Johnson,\nour Chief Partnership Officer, and three non-executive directors. As a\n267\nTable of Contents\nforeign private issuer, under the listing requirements and rules of the NYSE, we are not required to have independent directors on our board of directors,\nexcept that our audit committee is required to consist fully of independent directors, subject to certain phase-in schedules. We expect that our board of\ndirectors will determine that none of our non-executive directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in\ncarrying out the responsibilities of director and that each of these three directors is \u201cindependent\u201d as that term is defined under the NYSE rules.\nFamily Relationships\nAli Parsadoust, Babylon Holdings\u2019 Founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, and Mairi Johnson,\nBabylon Holdings\u2019 Chief Partnerships Officer and a member of Babylon Holdings\u2019 board of directors, are married. There are no other family relationships\namong any of our executive officers or directors.\nCommittees of our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has two standing committees: an audit and risk committee and a remuneration committee. In connection with the Closing, we\nintend to establish a nominating and corporate governance committee. Following the Closing, the charters for each of the committees of our board of\ndirectors will be available at the investor relations section of our website.\nAudit Committee\nFollowing the Closing, we expect that our audit committee will consist of Messrs. Brilioth, Ganev and Warren. We have determined that each of\nMessrs. Brilioth and Ganev meets the requirements for independence under the listing standards of the NYSE and SEC rules and regulations. We expect\nto make a determination regarding Mr. Warren\u2019s independence once he joins our board of directors at Closing. Each member of our audit committee will\nalso meet the requirements for financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE listing rules.\nFollowing the Closing, our audit committee will, among other things:\n\u2022\nselect and hire a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements\u037e\n\u2022\noversee our relationship with the independent registered public accounting firm and assess the effectiveness of the external audit process,\nincluding in relation to appointment and tendering, remuneration and other terms of engagement, and appropriate planning ahead of each\nannual audit cycle\u037e\n\u2022\nmaintain regular, timely, open and honest communication with the external auditors, ensuring the external auditors report to the committee\non all relevant matters to enable the committee to carry out its oversight responsibilities\u037e\n\u2022\nmonitor the integrity of our financial and narrative reporting, preliminary announcements and any other formal announcements relating to\nour financial performance\u037e\n\u2022\nadvise the board on whether, taken as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable\u037e\n\u2022\nreview the appropriateness and completeness of our risk management and internal controls\u037e\n\u2022\nconsider annually whether we should have an internal audit function\u037e\n\u2022\nreview, approve and/or ratify related party transactions\u037e and\n268\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\napprove or, as required, pre-approve, all audit and all permissible non-audit services, other than de minimis non-audit services, to be\nperformed by the independent registered public accounting firm.\nRemuneration Committee\nFollowing the Closing, we expect that our remuneration committee will consist of Messrs. Brilioth and Ganev. As a foreign private issuer, we are not\nrequired to comply with the NYSE listing requirements that would otherwise require our remuneration committee to be comprised entirely of independent\ndirectors. However, currently all of the anticipated members of our remuneration committee are independent under the applicable the NYSE rules and\nregulations. Each member of our remuneration committee will also be a non-employee director, as defined pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the\nExchange Act.\nFollowing the Closing, our remuneration committee will, among other things:\n\u2022\nset a remuneration policy that is designed to promote our long-term success\u037e\n\u2022\nensure that the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives reflects both their individual performance and their\ncontribution to our overall results\u037e\n\u2022\ndetermine the terms of employment and remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives, including recruitment and retention\nterms\u037e\n\u2022\napprove the design and performance targets of any annual incentive schemes that include the executive directors and other senior\nexecutives\u037e\n\u2022\nagree upon the design and performance targets, where applicable, of all share incentive plans\u037e\n\u2022\ngather and analyze appropriate data from comparator companies our industry\u037e and\n\u2022\nselect and appoint external advisers to the remuneration committee, if any, to provide independent remuneration advice where necessary.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nIn connection with the Closing, we expect to establish a nominating and corporate governance committee, which we expect will consist of Messrs.\nBrilioth and Ganev.\nFollowing the Closing, our nominating and corporate governance committee will, among other things:\n\u2022\nidentify individuals qualified to become members of our board of directors\u037e\n\u2022\nrecommend to our board of directors the persons to be nominated for election as directors and to each of the committees of our board of\ndirectors\u037e\n\u2022\nreview and make recommendations to our board of directors with respect to our board leadership structure\u037e\n\u2022\nreview and make recommendations to our board of directors with respect to management succession planning\u037e and\n\u2022\ndevelop and recommend to our board of directors corporate governance principles.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nIn connection with our listing on the NYSE, we expect to adopt a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that covers a broad range of matters\nincluding the handling of conflicts of interest, compliance issues and other corporate policies such as equal opportunity and non-discrimination\nstandards.\nDirectors\u2019 Addresses\nEach of the directors can be contacted at the executive office of Babylon.\n269\nTable of Contents",

We plan to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance to insure such persons against certain liabilities. Insofar as indemnification of liabilities\narising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our board, executive officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we\nhave been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore\nunenforceable.\n276\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\nCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions\u2014Alkuri\nSponsor Shares\nIn December 2020, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of\n$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. The number of shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock issued to the Sponsor was determined based on the\nexpectation that such shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock upon completion\nof the Alkuri IPO. The shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock (including the Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not,\nsubject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.\nAlkuri Private Placement Warrants\nThe Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrants in a private placement that occurred\nsimultaneously with the closing of the Alkuri IPO. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A\nCommon Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise\nthereof) may not, subject to certain limitation, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.\nAgreements with Directors and Officers and their Affiliates\nNo compensation of any kind, including any finder\u2019s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid\nby us to the Sponsor, Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors, or any affiliate of the Sponsor or Alkuri\u2019s officers, prior to, or in connection with any services\nrendered in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these\nindividuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on Alkuri\u2019s behalf, such as identifying potential\ntarget businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Alkuri does not have a policy that prohibits the Sponsor, executive\nofficers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Alkuri\u2019s\naudit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors, or any of their affiliates and will\ndeterminate which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket\nexpenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on Alkuri\u2019s behalf.\nAffiliate Loans\nThe Sponsor agreed to loan Alkuri up to an aggregate of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the Alkuri IPO. Alkuri had borrowed\n$300,000 under such promissory note and repaid $300,000 upon the closing of the Alkuri IPO out of the offering proceeds that had been allocated to the\npayment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.\nIn addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the\nSponsor or certain of Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan Alkuri funds as may be required. If Alkuri complete an initial\nbusiness combination, Alkuri would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, Alkuri may use a\nportion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from Alkuri\u2019s trust account would be used\nfor such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The\nwarrants would be identical to the private placement warrants discussed above, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The\nterms of such loans by Alkuri\u2019s officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist\n277Table of Contents\nwith respect to such loans. Alkuri does not expect to seek loans from parties other than the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor as Alkuri does not\nbelieve third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in Alkuri\u2019s trust account.\nConsulting, Management, and Other Fees\nAfter the Business Combination, members of Alkuri\u2019s management team who remain with Babylon may be paid consulting, management or other\nfees from Babylon with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to Alkuri Stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or\ntender offer documents, as applicable, furnished to Alkuri Stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of\ndistribution of such proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business\nto determine executive and director compensation.\nRegistration Rights\nAlkuri has entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, the warrants issuable upon conversion of\nworking capital loans (if any) and the shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the Alkuri\nClass B Common Stock. In connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, this registration rights agreement was amended and restated as more\nfully described below under \u201cAgreements Entered Into in Connection with the Merger Agreement\u2014Registration Rights Agreement.\u201d\nMaterial Agreements\nAlkuri has agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon\nClosing, Alkuri will cease paying the Sponsor these monthly fees.\nCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions\u2014Babylon\nAgreements with Shareholders\nSeries C Financing and Related Agreements\nOn August 1, 2019, Babylon Holdings sold 187,681,013 Babylon Holdings Series C Shares to certain purchasers, including entities affiliated with\nthe Public Investment Fund (\u201cPIF\u201d), Invik S.A.

In September 2020, in an extension of the Series C Financing, Babylon Holdings issued an\nadditional 6,976,194 Babylon Holdings Series C Shares to Photenalo Limited and Atlas Peak Capital II, L.P., each of whom granted a voting power of\nattorney over their Babylon Holdings Shares in favor of VNV, such that those shares are voted as directed by VNV (or Babylon Holdings in the event that\nVNV ceases to be a shareholder in Babylon Holdings).\nConvertible Notes\nPursuant to a loan note instrument constituting up to \u00a317 million unsecured convertible loan notes, dated June 8, 2018, as amended on September\n7, 2018, Babylon Holdings issued \u00a310 million and \u00a37 million of unsecured convertible loan notes to affiliates of Kinnevik and Vostok New Ventures\n(Cyprus) Limited, an entity affiliated with VNV, respectively.\n278\nTable of Contents\nOn April 25, 2019, Babylon Holdings issued unsecured convertible loan notes (the \u201cApril Notes\u201d) to Kinnevik Online AB for an amount of \u00a36\nmillion, Vostok New Ventures (Cyprus) Limited for an amount of \u00a36 million and NNS for an amount of \u00a312 million, for an aggregate amount of \u00a324 million.\nOn July 5, 2019, Babylon issued unsecured convertible loan notes (the \u201cJuly Notes\u201d) to Kinnevik Online AB for an amount of \u00a312 million and Vostok New\nVentures (Cyprus) Limited for an amount \u00a36 million for an aggregate amount of \u00a318 million.

Pursuant to a loan note waiver, dated\nAugust 1, 2019, between Babylon Holdings and NNS, the converting notes did not include those notes held by NNS.\nOn June 3, 2020, in connection with Babylon Holdings\u2019 investment into Higi, ALP, as lender, entered into a promissory note with Higi, as borrower,\nin which Higi promises to pay ALP an aggregate principal sum of $5 million (the \u201cALP Note\u201d). The ALP Note is expected to be paid off in connection with\nthe Higi acquisition and, pursuant to the ALP Note, Higi is obligated to repay interest for two years in the aggregate in addition to the principal amount.\nPursuant to a loan note instrument, dated November 12, 2020, constituting unsecured convertible loan notes (in the aggregate, the \u201cVNV Notes\u201d),\nBabylon Holdings issued two tranches of notes: (i) $30 million in the aggregate consisting of (a) $15 million of notes on November 16, 2020 to Global\nHealth Equity AB (publ), which were subsequently transferred to Global Health Equity (Cyprus) Ltd., and (b) $15 million of notes on December 2, 2020\nissued to Global Health Equity (Cyprus) Limited (collectively the \u201cTranche 1 Notes\u201d), and (ii) $70 million in the aggregate issued on December 30, 2020, to\nGlobal Health equity (Cyprus) Limited (the \u201cTranche 2 Notes\u201d).\nOn December 30, 2020, the Tranche 1 Notes converted into 17,708,792 Babylon Holdings Series C Shares in connection with the conversion of all\n$30 million outstanding in Tranche 1 Notes.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Tranche 2 Notes converted into 41,012,358 Babylon Holdings Series C Shares in connection with the conversion of all $70\nmillion outstanding in Tranche 2 Notes.\nBabylon Holdings had originally anticipated agreement on the Business Combination several months earlier than it was originally agreed due to\nmarket conditions. As such, it has subsequently obtained bridge financing to address short-term cash flow needs pending consummation of the\nBusiness Combination. Accordingly, on July 15, 2021, Babylon Holdings entered into a loan agreement with VNV Group for $15.0 million. The interest rate\non the loan is 14%. This loan agreement is expected to be repaid upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nOn August 18, 2021, Babylon Holdings issued $50.0 million in unsecured bonds at a discount of 4.0% (\u201cUnsecured Bonds\u201d), including the non-\ncash conversion of $8.0 million in borrowings under the loan agreement dated July 15, 2021 with VNV (Cyprus) Limited into Unsecured Bonds. The\ninterest rate on the loan is 10%, with interest payable quarterly. The proceeds from the Unsecured Bonds can be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company utilized proceeds of $7.2 million from the Unsecured Bonds to settle the remainder of the loan and interest with VNV (Cyprus) Limited. Cash\nproceeds from the bond issuance, net of discounts, repayments of borrowings, and transaction expenses totalled approximately $32.1 million. The\nUnsecured Bonds have a one year term and they can be redeemed by Babylon Holdings at any time. Payment of the bonds is mandatory upon\ncompletion of a business combination or change in control. Babylon Holdings must maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million to comply with\nfinancial covenants.\nAmended and Restated Shareholders\u2019 Agreement\nOn August 1, 2019, in connection with Babylon Holdings\u2019 Series C Financing described above, Babylon Holdings entered into a Shareholders\u2019\nAgreement (the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d), with the holders of Babylon\n279\nTable of Contents\nHoldings Series C Shares and certain holders of Babylon Holdings\u2019 ordinary shares, including Dr. Parsadoust\u037e Hanging Gardens Limited (\u201cHGL\u201d)\u037e ALP\u037e\nKinnevik\u037e VNV\u037e NNS\u037e Nedgroup Trust (Jersey) Limited (as trustee for the Parsa Family Foundation)\u037e and PIF, each a holder of at least 5% of Babylon\nHoldings\u2019 share capital.

The Shareholders\u2019 Agreement will terminate in connection with the Closing of the Business\nCombination.\nAgreements with Executive Officers and Directors\nEmployment Agreements\nBabylon Holdings has entered into written employment agreements with its executive officers. The agreements of Dr. Parsadoust and Mr. Steel\nprovide notice periods with respect to termination of the agreement by Babylon Holdings or by the relevant executive officer, during which time the\nexecutive officer will continue to receive salary and benefits\u037e provided that we may provide payment in lieu of all or a portion of the notice period. The\nwritten employment agreements with other Babylon Holdings\u2019 executive officers are at-will, and generally provide for customary severance.\nThese employment agreements also contain customary provisions regarding non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality of information and\nassignment of inventions.

        "Section Text": "DESCRIPTION OF BABYLON\u2019S SHARE CAPITAL AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\nA summary of the material provisions governing Babylon\u2019s share capital immediately following the completion of the Business Combination is\nprovided below. This summary is not complete and should be read together with the Babylon Articles, a copy of which is appended to this proxy\nstatement/prospectus as Annex B. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to Babylon.\nThe following is a description of the material terms of the Babylon Articles that will be in effect upon the Closing of the Business Combination. The\nfollowing descriptions of share capital and provisions of the Babylon Articles are summaries and are qualified by reference to the Babylon Articles, a\ncopy of which is appended to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this\nproxy statement/prospectus forms a part. The description of the ordinary shares reflects changes to our capital structure that will occur upon the closing\nof the Transactions.\nShare Capital\nUpon the Closing of the Business Combination, Babylon\u2019s authorized share capital will be $409,896.05 divided into 6,500,000,000 Class A ordinary\nshares with a par or nominal value of $0.0000422573245084686 each (the \u201cBabylon Class A Shares\u201d), 3,100,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par\nvalue of $0.0000422573245084686 each (the \u201cBabylon Class B Shares\u201d), and 100,000,000 deferred shares with a par value of $0.0000422573245084686 each.\nFollowing the Closing, there will be 361,714,531 Babylon Class A Shares, 79,637,576 Babylon Class B Shares and no deferred shares outstanding. Each\nissued Babylon Share is fully paid.\nConversion of Babylon Class B Shares\nThe Babylon Articles contain both mandatory and optional mechanics whereby Babylon Class B Shares may be converted into Babylon Class A\nShares.\nFrom a mandatory perspective, Babylon Class B Shares will automatically convert and immediately be treated as Babylon Class A Shares in the\nfollowing circumstances:\n\u2022\nwith the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds by nominal value of the issued Babylon Class B Shares\u037e\n\u2022\nupon any transfer of the Babylon Class B Shares to any person (other than to specified permitted transferees of Ali Parsadoust)\u037e\n\u2022\nwhere any of the Babylon Class B Shares cease to be beneficially owned at any time by Dr. Ali Parsadoust or any of his permitted\ntransferees\u037e\n\u2022\non such date that (i) Dr. Parsadoust (together with any of his permitted transferees) no longer hold at least five per cent of the Babylon\nClass B Shares held by Dr. Parsadoust (together with his permitted transferees) at the Closing of the Business Combination and (ii) is either\n(a) at least 12 months following Dr. Parsadoust\u2019s voluntary resignation as CEO and director of Babylon or (b) at least 12 months following\nthe death or permanent incapacity of Dr. Parsadoust.\nThe Babylon Articles also contain a series of optional conversion mechanics for the Babylon Class B Shares, primarily that a holder of Babylon\nClass B Shares is entitled at any time to convert all (or part) of their holding of fully-paid Babylon Class B Shares to the same number of fully paid\nBabylon Class A Shares by delivering to the company (or its representative) written notice of such conversion (and in the case of a certificated share, the\ncertificate(s) representing the Babylon Class B Shares to be converted.\n282Table of Contents\nVoting Rights\nSubject to the rights attaching to the relevant shares in the Babylon Articles, holders of Babylon Class A Shares will be entitled to cast one (1) vote\nper Babylon Class A Shares, and holders of Babylon Class B Shares will be entitled to cast fifteen (15) votes per Babylon Class B Shares. Deferred shares\ncarry no voting rights.\nShareholder Meetings\nGeneral Meetings\nAn annual general meeting and any other shareholders\u2019 meeting (whether convened for the passing of an ordinary or a special resolution) shall be\ncalled by at least 14 days\u2019 notice given to all of the members, directors and auditors.\nSpecial Meetings\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, only our board of directors or shareholders holding at least 10% of the total voting rights of our share capital can\nrequisition a shareholders\u2019 meeting. A meeting requisitioned by shareholders must be held within two months of receipt by us of the written request, but\nsuch shareholders may call the meeting if our board of directors does not call the meeting within 21 days of the date of deposit of the written request at\nour registered office, in which event such meeting must be held within three months of the date of deposit of the written request of our registered office.\nAction by Written Consent\nThe Babylon Articles prohibit the passing of a resolution of the shareholders in writing, save that where the holder(s) of Babylon Class B Shares\nhold at least a simple majority of the total voting rights held by the shareholders of Babylon, a resolution in writing (be that an ordinary or special\nresolution, but excluding a resolution removing an auditor) which is signed by shareholders who would be entitled to receive notice of and attend and\nvote at a general meeting at which such resolution would be proposed and which represent such number of the voting rights as would be required to\npass the resolutions on a poll taken at the meeting of those shareholders, shall be valid and effectual. Upon Closing, the Founder will hold all outstanding\nBabylon Class B Shares and a simple majority of the total voting rights held by shareholders of Babylon. Consequently, the Founder will have sufficient\nvoting control over Babylon to approve matters subject to shareholder approval by written consent, without prior notice and without submitting matters\nto the other shareholders for approval.\nBoard of Directors\nElection of Directors\nUnder the Babylon Articles, our board of directors shall not, unless otherwise determined by an ordinary resolution of the company, be less than\nthree but is not subject to a maximum number. We currently have five members on our board of directors, and we expect that there will be six directors\nfollowing the Closing of the Business Combination. Shareholders are only able to appoint a person as a director at a shareholder meeting if either (i) the\nrelevant person has been recommended by our board of directors or is a serving director who is retiring at that shareholder meeting\u037e or (ii) if a shareholder\n(other than the person proposed as a director) who is entitled to attend and vote at that shareholder meeting has submitted written notice to us of their\nintention to nominate the relevant person no less than 90 and no more than 120 full days prior to the date of that shareholder meeting, along with a notice\nfrom the relevant person confirming their willingness to be appointed. In addition, the board of directors itself may appoint any person who is willing to\nact to be a director, subject to maximum director limitations.\nRemoval of Directors\nUnder the Babylon Articles, each director of the board of directors who holds such office on the date that is seven days before the notice of\nBabylon\u2019s annual general meeting shall retire from office and shall be subject to re-election at each annual general meeting.\n283\nTable of Contents\nBabylon may also remove a director, notwithstanding the above or in any agreement between a relevant director and Babylon, by an ordinary\nresolution of shareholders.\nDirectors\u2019 Conflict of Interests\nAn interested director must disclose to the company the nature and extent of any interest in a transaction with the company, or one of its\nsubsidiaries, which to a material extent conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the company and of which the director is aware. Failure to disclose\nan interest entitles the company or a shareholder to apply to the court for an order setting aside the transaction concerned and directing that the director\naccount to the company for any profit or gain realized. A director shall not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in respect of any resolution\nconcerning that director\u2019s own appointment or termination, and may not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in respect of any resolution\nrelating to a transaction or arrangement of the company in which that director has an interests which may reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to\na conflict of interest, subject only to certain exceptions (including that the resolutions concerns a transaction or arrangement in which the director is\ninterested by virtue of an interest in shares, debentures or other securities of the company or otherwise in or through the company).\nA transaction is not voidable and a director is not accountable notwithstanding a failure to disclose an interest if the transaction is confirmed by\nspecial resolution and the nature and extent of the director\u2019s interest in the transaction are disclosed in reasonable detail in the notice calling the meeting\nat which the resolution is passed.\nAlthough it may still order that a director account for any profit, a court will not set aside a transaction unless it is satisfied that the interests of third\nparties who have acted in good faith would not thereby be unfairly prejudiced and the transaction was not reasonable and fair in the interests of the\ncompany at the time it was entered into.\nTransfer of Shares\nUnder the Babylon Articles, a member is permitted to transfer all or any of their shares in any manner which is permitted by Jersey Companies Law,\nsubject to certain restrictions in respect of lock-up provisions. See \u201cAgreements Entered Into in Connection with the Merger Agreement\u2014Lockup\nAgreement.\u201d\nDividends and Liquidation Rights\nSubject to Babylon agreeing with any member that all or any part of the Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares held by such member\n(from time-to-time) shall be subject to provisions set out in a separate agreement, the holders of such Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares\nare entitled to receive dividends in proportion to the number of Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares held by them. Holders of Babylon\nClass A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares are entitled, in proportion to the number of ordinary shares held by them, to participate in a return of assets\nupon a liquidation/winding-up. Holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive any dividend or distribution declared, nor are they entitled to share\nin any surplus on a winding up of Babylon.\nVariation of Rights\nThe rights attached to any class of Babylon Shares may only be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of at least three quarters in\nnominal value of the issued shares of the relevant class, or with the authority of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of those\nshares.\nThe consent in writing of the holders of more than half of the issued Babylon Class B Shares is required for any amendment to the powers,\npreferences or other rights attached to the Babylon Class A Shares\u037e any dividend or other distribution to the Babylon Class A Shares which is not made\npro rata to the Babylon Class B Shares\u037e or\n284\nTable of Contents\nany proposal to treat the Babylon Class A Shares differently from the Babylon Class B Shares with respect to any consolidation, subdivision,\nrecapitalization or similar, with respect to any consideration in to which the shares are converted or any consideration paid or otherwise distributed to\nBabylon\u2019s shareholders upon a change of control following a listing, in each case where such action would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the\nrights attaching to the Babylon Class B Shares.\nThe consent in writing of the holders of more than half of the issued Babylon Class A Shares is required for any amendment to the powers,\npreferences or other rights attached to the Babylon Class B Shares\u037e any dividend or other distribution to the Babylon Class B Shares which is not made\npro rata to the Babylon Class A Shares\u037e or any proposal to treat the Babylon Class B Shares differently from the Babylon Class A Shares with respect to\nany consolidation, subdivision, recapitalization or similar, with respect to any consideration in to which the shares are converted or any consideration\npaid or otherwise distributed to Babylon\u2019s shareholders upon a change of control following a listing, in each case where such action would be reasonably\nlikely to adversely affect the rights attaching to the Babylon Class A Shares.\nOptions\nThe board of directors is able to exercise the powers of Babylon in order to, amongst other actions, establish, maintain, adopt and enable\nparticipation in any profit sharing or incentive scheme including shares, share options or cash or similar schemes for the benefit of any director or\nemployee of Babylon. In addition, the board of directors has broad rights (subject to Jersey Companies Law, the Babylon Articles and any resolution of\nBabylon) to generally grant options over any unissued shares in Babylon on such terms as the board may decide.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Articles of Association\nGeneral\nThe Babylon Articles will contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring or seeking\nto acquire control of us. These provisions are designed to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These\nprovisions are also intended to encourage anyone seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. However, these\nprovisions may also delay, deter or prevent a change in control or other takeovers of our company that our shareholders might consider to be in their best\ninterests, including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares\nand also may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our Babylon Class A Shares or Babylon Class B Shares. These provisions\nmay also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. We believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to\nnegotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us, and that the benefits of this increased protection\noutweigh the disadvantages of discouraging those proposals, because negotiation of those proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. A\ndescription of these provisions is set forth below.\nDual Class\nAs described above in \u201c \u2014Voting Rights,\u201d the Babylon Articles provide for a dual class share capital structure, as a result of which holders of\nBabylon Class B Shares will be entitled to 15 votes per share, while holders of Babylon Class A Shares are entitled to one vote per share. This will\nprovide holders of Babylon Class B Shares with significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of\ndirectors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Babylon or its assets.\nAdvance Notice Procedure\nThe Babylon Articles will provide that a shareholder of Babylon may propose the nomination of a candidate to be elected as a director at a general\nmeeting. Such shareholder must, among other things, provide notice\n285\nTable of Contents\nthereof in writing to Babylon not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the meeting.\nThe notice must contain, among other things, the particulars which would, if the person were so elected to the position of director, be required to\nbe included in Babylon\u2019s register of directors and a notice executed by the person of the person\u2019s willingness to be elected.\nExclusive Forum Provision\nThe Babylon Articles will provide that, unless Babylon consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Courts of Jersey shall (to\nthe fullest extent permitted by law) be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by Babylon\ndirectors and officers, actions arising out of Jersey Companies Law or actions arising out of or in connection with the Babylon Articles (pursuant to any\nprovisions of Jersey law) or otherwise relating to the constitution or conduct of the company itself (other than any such action of the company that may\narise out of a breach of any federal law of the United States or the laws of any U.S. state). The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative\nshareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from\nasserting jurisdiction over such claims. In addition, unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, U.S federal district\ncourts shall be the sole and exclusive form for any resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nLimitation of Liability of Directors and Officers\nTo the maximum extent permitted by Jersey law, the Babylon Articles will include provisions that indemnify the personal liability of directors or\nofficers incurred by them for negligence, default, breach of duty or otherwise in relation to the company. The Babylon Articles also enable the board to\npurchase and maintain relevant insurance for the benefit of Babylon\u2019s directors, officers, employees or auditors.\nWe believe that the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the Babylon Articles and the indemnification agreements will facilitate\nour ability to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under\nthe Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been\ninformed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nGeneral Other Jersey, Channel Islands Law Considerations\nDividends and other distributions\nWe may not pay any dividend (whether in cash or assets) unless our directors who are to authorize the dividend have made a statutory solvency\nstatement that, immediately following the date on which the payment is proposed to be made, Babylon will be able to discharge its liabilities as they fall\ndue and, having regard to certain prescribed factors including the directors\u2019 intentions regarding the management of Babylon, Babylon will be able to\ncontinue to carry on business and discharge its liabilities as they fall due for the 12 months immediately following the date on which the payment is\nproposed to be made (or until Babylon is dissolved on a solvent basis, if earlier).\nDividends may not be debited to the company\u2019s nominal capital account or any capital redemption reserve, but may be debited to a share premium\naccount. Jersey law does not require that a company has positive profit and loss, retained earnings or similar in order for a dividend to be lawfully paid.\nThe foregoing also applies to certain types of other distributions made by a Jersey company.\n286\nTable of Contents\nPurchase of Own Shares\nAs with declaring a dividend, we may not buy back or redeem our shares unless our directors who are to authorize the buyback or redemption have\nmade a statutory solvency statement that, immediately following the date on which the buyback or redemption is proposed to be made, the company will\nbe able to discharge its liabilities as they fall due and, having regard to certain prescribed factors including the directors\u2019 intentions regarding the\nmanagement of the company, the company will be able to continue to carry on business and discharge its liabilities as they fall due for the 12 months\nimmediately following the date on which the buyback or redemption is proposed to be made (or until the company is dissolved on a solvent basis, if\nearlier).\nIf the above conditions are met, we may purchase shares in the manner described below.\nWe may purchase on a stock exchange our own fully paid shares pursuant to a special resolution of our shareholders. The resolution authorizing\nthe purchase must specify:\n\u2022\nthe maximum number of shares to be purchased\u037e\n\u2022\nthe maximum and minimum prices which may be paid\u037e and\n\u2022\na date, not being later than five years after the passing of the resolution, on which the authority to purchase is to expire.\nWe may purchase our own fully paid shares otherwise than on a stock exchange pursuant to a special resolution of our shareholders, but only if\nthe purchase is made on the terms of a written purchase contract which has been approved by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. The\nshareholder from whom we propose to purchase or redeem shares is not entitled to vote the shares being purchased on such resolutions.\nWe may fund a redemption or purchase of our own shares from any source. We cannot purchase our shares if, as a result of such purchase, only\nredeemable shares would remain in issue.\nIf authorized by a resolution of our shareholders, any shares that we redeem or purchase may be held by us as treasury shares. Any shares held by\nus as treasury shares may be cancelled, sold, transferred for the purposes of or under an employee share scheme or held without cancelling, selling or\ntransferring them. Shares redeemed or purchased by us are cancelled where we have not been authorized to hold these as treasury shares.\nMandatory Purchases and Acquisitions\nThe Jersey Companies Law provides that where a person has made an offer to acquire a class of all of our outstanding shares not already held by\nthe person and has as a result of such offer acquired or contractually agreed to acquire 90% or more of such outstanding shares, that person is then\nentitled (and may be required) to acquire the remaining shares of such shares. In such circumstances, a holder of any such remaining shares may apply to\nthe Jersey court for an order that the person making such offer not be entitled to purchase the holder\u2019s shares or that the person purchase the holder\u2019s\nshares on terms different to those under which the person made such offer.\nOther than as described above and below under \u201c \u2014U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers,\u201d we are not subject to any regulations under\nwhich a shareholder that acquires a certain level of share ownership is then required to offer to purchase all of our remaining shares on the same terms as\nsuch shareholder\u2019s prior purchase.\nCompromises and Arrangements\nWhere we and our creditors or shareholders or a class of either of them propose a compromise or arrangement between us and our creditors or our\nshareholders or a class of either of them (as applicable), the Jersey court may order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors or of our shareholders\nor class of\n287\nTable of Contents\nshareholders (as applicable) to be called in such a manner as the court directs. Any compromise or arrangement approved by a majority in number\nrepresenting 75% or more in value of the creditors or 75% or more of the voting rights of shareholders or class of either of them (as applicable) if\nsanctioned by the court, is binding upon us and all the creditors, shareholders or members of the specific class of either of them (as applicable).\nWhether the capital of the company is to be treated as being divided into a single or multiple class(es) of shares is a matter to be determined by the\ncourt. The court may in its discretion treat a single class of shares as multiple classes, or multiple classes of shares as a single class, for the purposes of\nthe shareholder approval referred to above taking into account all relevant circumstances, which may include circumstances other than the rights\nattaching to the shares themselves.\nU.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers\nThe U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \u201cTakeover Code\u201d), applies, among other things, to an offer for a public company whose\nregistered office is in the Channel Islands and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility in the\nUnited Kingdom or any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers\n(the \u201cTakeover Panel\u201d), to have its place of central management and control in the United Kingdom or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man (in each\ncase, a \u201cCode Company\u201d). This is known as the \u201cresidency test.\u201d Under the Takeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place\nof central management and control in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man by looking at various factors, including the structure of\nour board of directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.\nThe Takeover Code provides a framework within which takeovers of companies subject to it are conducted. In particular, the Takeover Code\ncontains certain rules in respect of mandatory offers for Code Companies. Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, if a person:\n\u2022\nacquires an interest in shares of a Code Company that, when taken together with shares in which persons acting in concert with such\nperson are interested, carry 30% or more of the voting rights of the Code Company\u037e or\n\u2022\nwho, together with persons acting in concert with such person, is interested in shares that in the aggregate carry not less than 30% and not\nmore than 50% of the voting rights in the Code, acquires additional interests in shares that increase the percentage of shares carrying\nvoting rights in which that person is interested\u037e\n\u2022\nthe acquirer, and, depending on the circumstances, its concert parties, would be required (except with the consent of the Takeover Panel) to\nmake a cash offer (or provide a cash alternative) for the Code Company\u2019s outstanding shares at a price not less than the highest price paid\nfor any interests in the shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months.\nBabylon will not be subject to the Takeover Code upon the Closing, but may in the future become subject to the Takeover Code in the event of\nchanges in the board\u2019s composition, changes to the Takeover Code or other relevant change of circumstances.\nRights of Minority Shareholders\nUnder Article 141 of the Jersey Companies Law, a shareholder may apply to court for relief on the grounds that the conduct of our affairs, including\na proposed or actual act or omission by us, is \u201cunfairly prejudicial\u201d to the interests of our shareholders generally or of some part of our shareholders,\nincluding at least the shareholder making the application. What amounts to unfair prejudice is not defined in the Jersey Companies Law. There may also\nbe common law personal actions available to our shareholders.\nUnder Article 143 of the Jersey Companies Law (which sets out the types of relief a court may grant in relation to an action brought under Article\n141 of the Jersey Companies Law), the court may make an order\n288\nTable of Contents\nregulating our affairs, requiring us to refrain from doing or continuing to do an act complained of, authorizing civil proceedings and providing for the\npurchase of shares by us or by any of our other shareholders.\nJersey Regulatory Matters\nThe Jersey Financial Services Commission (\u201cJFSC\u201d), has given, and has not withdrawn, its consent under Articles 2 and 4 of the Control of\nBorrowing (Jersey) Order 1958 to the issue of securities in Babylon. The JFSC is protected by the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Law 1947 against any\nliability arising from the discharge of its functions under that law.\nA copy of this prospectus has been delivered to the Jersey Registrar of Companies in accordance with Article 5 of the Companies (General\nProvisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 and the Jersey Registrar of Companies has given, and has not withdrawn, his consent to its circulation.\nIt must be distinctly understood that, in giving these consents, neither the Jersey Registrar of Companies nor the JFSC takes any responsibility for\nthe financial soundness of Babylon or for the correctness of any statements made, or opinions expressed, with regard to it.

All the directors of Babylon Holdings accept responsibility accordingly.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nBabylon Holdings Limited was incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, on April 11, 2014 with registered number 115471. Following\nthe Closing, the transfer agent and registrar for the Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Class B Shares in the United States will be Computershare Inc.,\nand its address is 250 Royall Street, Canton, Massachusetts 02021.

        "Section Text": "COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF BABYLON SHAREHOLDERS\nAND ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS\nThe rights of the shareholders of Babylon and the relative powers of the Babylon board of directors are governed by the laws of the Bailiwick of\nJersey and the Babylon Articles. As a result of the Transactions, securities held by the Alkuri Stockholders will be canceled and automatically converted\ninto the right to receive Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants. Each Babylon Share will be issued in accordance with, and subject to the\nrights and obligations of, the Babylon Articles which will be effective upon the consummation of the Transactions, in substantially the form attached\nhereto as Annex B. Because Babylon will be, at the Effective Time, a company organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, the rights of the\nstockholders of Alkuri will be governed by Jersey law and the Babylon Articles.\nMany of the principal attributes of Babylon Shares and Alkuri Common Stock will be similar. However, there are differences between the rights of\nshareholders of Babylon under Jersey law and the rights of stockholders of Alkuri, as in effect prior to the consummation of the Transactions under the\nDGCL. In addition, there are differences between the Babylon Articles as such will be in effect from and after the consummation of the Transactions and\nthe SPAC Charter and bylaws of Alkuri.\nThe following is a summary comparison of the material differences between the rights of Alkuri securityholders under the SPAC Charter, Alkuri\nbylaws and the DGCL, and the rights of Babylon shareholders under Jersey law and the Babylon Articles to be effective upon consummation of the\nTransactions. The discussion in this section does not include a description of rights or obligations under the United States federal securities laws or the\nNYSE listing requirements or of Babylon\u2019s or Alkuri\u2019s governance or other policies.\nThe statements in this section are a summary of the material rights of shareholders under the Jersey Companies Law, the Babylon Articles, the\nDGCL and the SPAC Charter and bylaws of Alkuri as they will be in effect from and after the Effective Time. The SPAC Charter is filed as an exhibit to the\nregistration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. You are also urged to carefully read the Jersey Companies Law and the\nDGCL.\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nAuthorized and Outstanding Share Capital\nThe authorized capital stock of Alkuri is\n400,000,000 shares of Alkuri Common Stock, par\nvalue $0.0001 per share, of which 380,000,000\nshares are designated as Alkuri Class A Common\nStock and 20,000,000 shares are designated as\nAlkuri Class B Common Stock, and 1,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per\nshare. Pursuant to the SPAC Charter, prior to the\nClosing, the shares of Alkuri Class B Common\nStock will automatically convert into shares of\nAlkuri Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one\nbasis.\nUpon the Closing, Babylon\u2019s authorized\nshare capital will consist of $409,896.05\ndivided into 6,500,000,000 Babylon Class A\nShares with a par value of\n$0.0000422573245084686 each, 3,100,000,000\nBabylon Class B Shares with a par value of\n$0.0000422573245084686 each, and\n100,000,000 deferred shares with a par value\nof $0.0000422573245084686 each.\nSpecial Meetings of Shareholders\nExcept as otherwise provided by law or the\nSPAC Charter, special meetings of stockholders\nmay\nThe Jersey Companies Law does not\nprovide for a shareholder right to put a\nproposal before the\n295Table of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nonly be called by a majority of the board of\ndirectors, or the Chief Executive Officer or the\nChairman.\nshareholders at the annual general meeting.\nHowever, under the Jersey Companies Law,\nshareholders holding 10% or more of the\ncompany\u2019s voting rights and entitled to\nvote at the relevant meeting may requisition\nthe directors to call a meeting of\nshareholders. This must be held as soon as\npracticable but in any case not later than\ntwo months after the date of the deposit of\nthe requisition. The requisition shall state\nthe objects of the meeting. If the directors\ndo not within 21 days from the date of the\ndeposit of the requisition proceed to call a\nmeeting to be held within two months of\nthat date, the requisitionists, or any of them\nrepresenting more than half of the total\nvoting rights of all of them, may themselves\ncall a meeting, but a meeting so called shall\nnot be held after three months from that\ndate.\nQuorum\nExcept as otherwise provided by the DGCL, or\nthe SPAC Charter, the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock\nentitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a\nquorum, present in person or by proxy, at a\nmeeting of stockholders for the transaction of\nany business.\nIf a quorum is not present at any meeting of the\nstockholders, the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock\nentitled to vote at such, shall have the power to\nadjourn the meeting from time to time, without\nnotice other than announcement at the meeting,\nuntil a quorum shall be present.

Such notice must\ncontain, among other things, certain information\nabout the stockholder giving the notice (and any\nbeneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the\nnomination or proposal is made) and certain\ninformation about any nominee or other\nproposed business.\nBabylon to propose the nomination of a\ncandidate to be elected as a director at a\ngeneral meeting such shareholder must,\namong other things, provide notice thereof\nin writing to Babylon not less than ninety\n(90) days nor more than one hundred and\ntwenty (120) days prior to the meeting.\nSuch notice must contain, among other\nthings, the particulars which would, if the\nperson were so elected to the position of\ndirector, be required to be included in\nBabylon\u2019s register of directors and a notice\nexecuted by the person of the person\u2019s\nwillingness to be elected.\nInterested Shareholders Transactions\nThe DGCL contains a business combination\nstatute applicable to Delaware corporations\nwhereby, unless the corporation has specifically\nelected not to be governed by such statute by\namendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is\nprohibited from engaging in certain business\ncombinations with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d\nfor three years following the date that such\nperson becomes an interested shareholder. An\ninterested shareholder generally is a person or a\ngroup who or which owns or\nThe Jersey Companies Law has no\ncomparable provision. As a result, Babylon\ncannot avail itself of the types of\nprotections afforded by the Delaware\nbusiness combination statute. However,\nalthough Jersey law does not regulate\ntransactions between a company and its\nsignificant shareholders, as a general matter,\nsuch transactions must be entered into\nbona fide in the best interests of the\ncompany and not with the effect of\nconstituting a fraud on the minority\nshareholders.\n298\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nowned more than 15% of the target\u2019s\noutstanding voting stock within the past three\nyears.\nThis has the effect of limiting the ability of a\npotential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the\ntarget in which all shareholders would not be\ntreated equally. The statute does not apply if,\namong other things, prior to the date on which\nsuch shareholder becomes an interested\nshareholder, the board of directors approves\neither the business combination or the\ntransaction which resulted in the person\nbecoming an interested shareholder. This\nencourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware\ncorporation to negotiate the terms of any\nacquisition transaction with the target\u2019s board of\ndirectors.\nInterested Director Transactions\nInterested director transactions are permissible\nand may not be legally voided if:\n\u2022\u2003\u200aeither a majority of disinterested directors,\nor a majority in interest of holders of shares\nof the corporation\u2019s capital stock entitled to\nvote upon the matter, approves the\ntransaction upon disclosure of all material\nfacts\u037e or\n\u2022\u2003\u200athe transaction is determined to have been\nfair as to the corporation as of the time it is\nauthorized, approved or ratified by the\nboard of directors, a committee thereof or\nthe shareholders.\nAn interested director must disclose to the\ncompany the nature and extent of any\ninterest in a transaction with the company,\nor one of its subsidiaries, which to a material\nextent conflicts or may conflict with the\ninterests of the company and of which the\ndirector is aware. Failure to disclose an\ninterest entitles the company or a\nshareholder to apply to the court for an\norder setting aside the transaction\nconcerned and directing that the director\naccount to the company for any profit.\nA transaction is not voidable and a director\nis not accountable notwithstanding a failure\nto disclose an interest if the transaction is\nconfirmed by special resolution and the\nnature and extent of the director\u2019s interest in\nthe transaction are disclosed in reasonable\ndetail in the notice calling the meeting at\nwhich the resolution is passed.\nAlthough it may still order that a director\naccount for any profit, a\n299\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\ncourt will not set aside a transaction unless\nit is satisfied that the interests of third\nparties who have acted in good faith would\nnot thereby be unfairly prejudiced and the\ntransaction was not reasonable and fair in\nthe interests of the company at the time it\nwas entered into.\nUnder the Babylon Articles, a director shall\nnot vote (or be counted in the quorum at a\nmeeting) in respect of any resolution\nconcerning that director\u2019s own appointment\nor termination, and may not vote (or be\ncounted in the quorum at a meeting) in\nrespect of any resolution relating to a\ntransaction or arrangement of the company\nin which that director has an interests which\nmay reasonably be regarded as likely to give\nrise to a conflict of interest, subject only to\ncertain exceptions (including that the\nresolutions concerns a transaction or\narrangement in which the director is\ninterested by virtue of an interest in shares,\ndebentures or other securities of the\ncompany or otherwise in or through the\ncompany).\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Sales\nWith certain exceptions, a merger, consolidation,\nor sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a\nDelaware corporation must be approved by the\nboard of directors and a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.\nThe Jersey Companies Law allows for the\nmerger of two companies into either one\nconsolidated company or one company\nmerged into another so as to form a single\nsurviving company. The merger or\nconsolidation of two or more companies\nunder the Jersey Companies Law requires\nthe directors of the constituent companies\nto enter into and to approve a written\nmerger agreement, which must also be\nauthorized by a special resolution of the\nshareholders of each constituent company\n(which as noted above requires the\naffirmative vote of no less than\n300\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\ntwo-thirds of the votes cast at a quorate\ngeneral meeting (or such higher threshold\nas may be set out in a company\u2019s articles of\nassociation)). In relation to any merger or\nconsolidation under the Jersey Companies\nLaw, unlike dissenting shareholders of a\nDelaware corporation, dissenting\nshareholders of a Jersey company have no\nappraisal rights that would provide the right\nto receive payment in cash for the judicially\ndetermined fair value of the shares.\nHowever, under Jersey law, dissenting\nshareholders may object to the Court on the\ngrounds they are unfairly prejudiced by the\nmerger.\nThe Jersey Companies Law provides that\nwhere a person has made an offer to acquire\na class or all of the company\u2019s outstanding\nshares not already held by the person and\nhas as a result of such offer acquired or\ncontractually agreed to acquire 90% or more\nof such outstanding shares, that person is\nthen entitled (and may be required) to\nacquire the remaining shares. In such\ncircumstances, a holder of any such\nremaining shares may apply to the courts of\nJersey for an order that the person making\nsuch offer not be entitled to purchase the\nholder\u2019s shares or that the person purchase\nthe holder\u2019s shares on terms different than\nthose under which the person made such\noffer.\nIn addition, where the company and its\ncreditors or shareholders or a class of either\nof them propose a compromise or\narrangement between the company and its\ncreditors or our shareholders or a class of\neither of them (as applicable), the courts of\nJersey may order a meeting of the creditors\nor class of creditors or of\n301\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nthe company\u2019s shareholders or class of\nshareholders (as applicable) to be called in\nsuch a manner as the court directs.

The court may in\nits discretion treat a single class of shares\nas multiple classes, or multiple classes of\nshares as a single class, for the purposes of\nthe shareholder approval referred to above,\ntaking into account all relevant\ncircumstances, which may include\ncircumstances other than the rights\nattaching to the shares themselves.\nThe Jersey Companies Law contains no\nspecific restrictions on the powers of\ndirectors to dispose of assets of a company.\nAs a matter of general law, in the exercise of\nthose powers, the directors must discharge\ntheir duties of care and act in good faith, for\na proper purpose and in the interests of the\ncompany.\nSize of Board\u037e Election and Removal of Directors\nThe Alkuri bylaws provide that the number of\ndirectors shall be fixed by a resolution of the\nboard of directors.\nEach director\u2019s term continues until the election\nand qualification of their successor, or their\nearlier death, resignation, or removal.\nAs permitted by the Jersey Companies Law\nand pursuant to the Babylon Articles,\ndirectors of Babylon can be appointed and\nremoved in the manner described in the\nsection headed \u201cDescription of Babylon\u2019s\nShare Capital and Articles of Association\n\u2014Election\n302\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nExcept as otherwise provided in the DGCL, the\nAlkuri bylaws provide that, in the interim\nbetween annual meetings of stockholders or\nspecial meetings of stockholders, vacancies and\nnewly created directorships shall be\nof Directors and Removal of Directors.\u201d\nfilled solely by a majority vote of the remaining\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a\nquorum, or by a sole remaining director and shall\nnot be filled by the stockholders, and such\ndirector so chosen shall hold office until the next\nelection of the class for which such director was\nchosen and until his successor shall be elected\nand qualified.\nUnder the Alkuri bylaws, any or all of the\ndirectors may be removed from office at any time,\nbut only for cause and only by the affirmative\nvote of the holders of a majority of the voting\npower of the then outstanding shares of capital\nstock of Alkuri entitled to vote generally in the\nelection of directors, voting together as a single\nclass.\nFiduciary Duties of Directors\nUnder the DGCL, a director of a Delaware\ncorporation has a fiduciary duty to the\ncorporation and its shareholders. This duty has\ntwo components, the duty of care and the duty\nof loyalty. The duty of care requires that a\ndirector act in good faith, with the care that an\nordinarily prudent person would exercise under\nsimilar circumstances. Under this duty, a director\nmust inform himself of, and disclose to\nshareholders, all material information reasonably\navailable regarding a significant transaction. The\nduty of loyalty requires that a director must act\nin a manner he or she reasonably believes to be\nin the best interests of the corporation. A\ndirector must not use his or her corporate\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, a director\nof a Jersey company, in exercising the\ndirector\u2019s powers and discharging the\ndirector\u2019s duties, has a fiduciary duty to act\nhonestly and in good faith with a view to\nthe best interests of the company\u037e and a\nduty of care to exercise the care, diligence\nand skill that a reasonably prudent person\nwould exercise in comparable\ncircumstances.\nCustomary law is also an important source\nof law in the area of directors\u2019 duties in\nJersey as it expands upon and provides a\nmore detailed understanding of the general\nduties and obligations of directors. The\nJersey courts view English common law as\nhighly\n303\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nposition for personal gain or advantage. This\nduty prohibits self-dealing by a director and\nmandates that the best interests of the\ncorporation and its shareholders take\nprecedence over any interest possessed by a\ndirector, officer or controlling shareholder and\nnot shared by the shareholders generally. In\ngeneral, actions of a director are presumed to\nhave been made on an informed basis, in good\nfaith and in the honest belief that the action\ntaken was in the best interests of the\ncorporation. However, this presumption may be\nrebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the\nfiduciary duties. Should such evidence be\npresented concerning a transaction by a director,\nthe director must prove the procedural fairness\nof the transaction and that the transaction was\nof fair value to the corporation.\npersuasive in this area. In summary, the\nfollowing duties will apply as manifestations\nof the general fiduciary duty under the\nJersey Companies Law: a duty to act in\ngood faith and in what he or she bona fide\nconsiders to be the best interests of the\ncompany\u037e a duty to exercise powers for a\nproper purpose\u037e a duty to avoid any actual\nor potential conflict between his or her own\nand the company\u2019s interests\u037e and a duty to\naccount for profits and not take personal\nprofit from any opportunities arising from\nhis or her directorship, even if he or she is\nacting honestly and for the good of the\ncompany. However, the articles of\nassociation of a company may permit the\ndirector to be personally interested in\narrangements involving the company\n(subject to the requirement to have\ndisclosed such interest).\nUnder the Babylon Articles, certain\nprovisions apply in respect of the interests\nof directors and their ability to participate in\nrelevant quorums and vote on resolutions in\nrespect of matters in which they are\ninterested\u2014see \u201cDescription of Babylon\u2019s\nShare Capital and Articles of Association\n\u2014Directors\u2019 Conflicts of Interest.\u201d See, in\naddition \u201cInterested Director Transactions\u201d\nabove.\nExclusive Forum\nThe SPAC Charter provides, that unless Alkuri\nconsents in writing to the selection of an\nalternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on\nbehalf of Alkuri\u037e any action asserting a breach of\nfiduciary duty\u037e any action asserting a claim\narising pursuant to the DGCL, the\nThe Babylon Articles will provide that,\nunless Babylon consents in writing to the\nselection of an alternative forum, the Courts\nof Jersey shall (to the fullest extent\npermitted by law) be the sole and exclusive\nforum for derivative shareholder actions,\nactions for breach of fiduciary duty by\nBabylon directors and officers, actions\narising out of Jersey\n304\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nSPAC Charter or Alkuri bylaws\u037e or any action\nasserting a claim against Alkuri that is governed\nby the internal affairs doctrine, except for, in each\nof the above actions, any claim as to which the\nCourt of Chancery determines it lacks\njurisdiction.

The exclusive forum provision would\nnot prevent derivative shareholder actions\nbased on claims arising under U.S. federal\nsecurities laws from being raised in a U.S.\ncourt and would not prevent a U.S. court\nfrom asserting jurisdiction over such claims.\nIn addition, unless the company consents in\nwriting to the selection of an alternative\nforum, U.S federal district courts shall be the\nsole and exclusive form for any resolution of\nany complaint asserting a cause of action\narising under the Securities Act.\nLimitations on Director\u2019s Liability and\nIndemnification of Directors and Officers\nUnder the SPAC Charter, directors shall not be\nliable to Alkuri for monetary damages for breach\nof fiduciary duty as a director, except to the\nextent such exculpation from liability is\nprohibited by the DGCL.\nAlkuri has indemnified, to the fullest extent\npermitted by the DGCL, any person from all\nliabilities and expenses incurred by him or her by\nreason of the fact that he or she is or was a\ndirector,\nofficer, employee or agent of Alkuri, or is or was\nserving at the request of Alkuri as a director,\nofficer, employee or agent of another entity.\nAlkuri will, in advance, pay the expenses,\nincluding attorney fees, incurred by an\nindemnified person in defending any proceeding,\nThe Jersey Companies Law does not\ncontain any provision permitting Jersey\ncompanies to limit the liabilities of directors\nfor breach of fiduciary duty.

In such\nactions, the court has discretion to permit the\nwinning party to recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred\nin connection with such action.\nUnder Article 141 of the Jersey Companies\nLaw, a shareholder may apply to court for\nrelief on the ground that the conduct of a\ncompany\u2019s affairs, including a proposed or\nactual act or omission by a company, is\n\u201cunfairly prejudicial\u201d to the interests of\nshareholders generally or of some part of\nshareholders, including at a minimum the\nshareholder making the application.\nUnder Article 143 of the Jersey Companies\nLaw (which sets out the types of relief a\ncourt may grant in relation to an action\nbrought under Article 141 of the Jersey\nCompanies Law), the court\n307\nTable of Contents\nAlkuri\nBabylon\nmay make an order regulating the affairs of a\ncompany, requiring a company to refrain\nfrom doing or continuing to do an act\ncomplained of, authorizing civil proceedings\nand providing for the purchase of shares by\na company or by any of its other\nshareholders.

The lien shall extend to every amount payable in respect of that share.\n(b)\nThe Board may at any time either generally or in any particular case declare any share to be wholly or partly exempt from this article. Unless\notherwise agreed, the registration of a transfer of a share shall operate as a waiver of the Company\u2019s lien (if any) on that share.\n97.\nEnforcement of lien\n(a)\nThe Company may sell any share subject to a lien in such manner as the Board may decide if an amount payable on the share is due and is\nnot paid within 14 clear days after a notice has been given to the holder or any person entitled by transmission to the share demanding\npayment of that amount and giving notice of intention to sell in default.\n(b)\nTo give effect to any sale under this article, the Board may authorise some person to transfer the share sold to, or as directed by, the\npurchaser. The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall the title of the new holder to the\nshare be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings relating to the sale.\n(c)\nThe net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs of such sale, shall be applied in or towards satisfaction of the amount due and any\nresidue shall (subject to a like lien for any amounts not presently due as existed on the share before the sale), on surrender, in the case of\nshares held in certificated form, of the certificate for the shares sold, be paid to the holder or person entitled by transmission to the share\nimmediately before the sale.\nB-44\nTable of Contents\nCALLS ON SHARES\n98.\nCalls\n(a)\nSubject to the terms of these articles and the terms of which the shares are allotted, the Board may make calls on the members in respect of\nany moneys unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of nominal amount or premium) and not payable on a date fixed by or in accordance\nwith the terms of issue. Each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days\u2019 notice specifying when and where payment is to be\nmade) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on the member\u2019s shares.

Sums treated as calls\nA sum which by the terms of allotment of a share is payable on allotment, or at a fixed time, or by instalments at fixed times, whether in respect of\nnominal value or premium, shall for all purposes of these articles be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date or dates fixed for\npayment and, in case of non-payment, these articles shall apply as if that sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call.\n101. Power to differentiate\nOn any allotment of shares the Board may make arrangements for a difference between the allottees or holders of the shares in the amounts and\ntimes of payment of calls on their shares.\n102. Payment of calls in advance\nThe Board may, if it thinks fit, receive all or any part of the moneys payable on a share beyond the sum actually called up on it if the holder is\nwilling to make payment in advance and, on any moneys so paid in advance, may (until they would otherwise be due) pay interest at such rate as\nmay be agreed between the Board and the member paying the sum in advance.\nFORFEITURE OF SHARES\n103. Notice of unpaid calls\n(a)\nIf the whole or any part of any call or instalment remains unpaid on any share after the due date for payment, the Board may give a notice to\nthe holder requiring the holder to pay so much of the call or instalment as remains unpaid, together with any accrued interest.\nB-45\nTable of Contents\n(b)\nThe notice shall state a further day, being not less than 14 clear days from the date of the notice, on or before which, and the place where,\npayment is to be made and shall state that, in the event of non-payment on or before the day and at the place appointed, the share in\nrespect of which the call was made or instalment is payable will be liable to be forfeited.\n(c)\nThe Board may accept a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited.\n104. Forfeiture on non-compliance with notice\n(a)\nIf the requirements of a notice given under article 103 are not complied with, any share in respect of which it was given may at any time\nthereafter (before the payment required by the notice is made) be forfeited by a resolution of the Board. The forfeiture shall include all\ndividends declared and other moneys payable in respect of the forfeited share and not actually paid before the forfeiture.\n(b)\nIf a share is forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be given to the person who was the holder of the share or (as the case may be) the person\nentitled to the share by transmission, and an entry that notice of the forfeiture has been given, with the relevant date, shall be made in the\nregister\u037e but no forfeiture shall be invalidated by any omission to give such notice or to make such entry.\n105. Power to annul forfeiture or surrender\nThe Board may, at any time before the forfeited or surrendered share has been sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, annul the forfeiture or\nsurrender upon payment of all calls and interest due on or incurred in respect of the share and on such further conditions (if any) as it thinks fit.\n106. Disposal of forfeited or surrendered shares\n(a)\nEvery share which is forfeited or surrendered shall become the property of the Company and (subject to the Statutes) may be sold, re-\nallotted or otherwise disposed of, upon such terms and in such manner as the Board shall decide either to the person who was before the\nforfeiture the holder of the share or to any other person and whether with or without all or any part of the amount previously paid up on the\nshare being credited as so paid up. The Board may for the purposes of a disposal authorise some person to transfer the forfeited or\nsurrendered share to, or in accordance with the directions of, any person to whom the same has been disposed of.\n(b)\nA statutory declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited or surrendered on a specified date shall, as against all\npersons claiming to be entitled to the share, be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it and shall (subject to the execution of any\nnecessary transfer) constitute a good title to the share. The person to whom the share has been disposed of shall not be bound to see to\nthe application of the consideration for the disposal (if any) nor shall that person\u2019s title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or\ninvalidity of the proceedings connected with the forfeiture, surrender, sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share.\n107. Arrears to be paid notwithstanding forfeiture or surrender\nA person any of whose shares have been forfeited or surrendered shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited or surrendered share and\nshall, in the case of shares held in certificated form, surrender to the Company for cancellation any certificate for the share forfeited or surrendered,\nbut shall remain liable (unless payment is waived in whole or in part by the Board) to pay to the Company all moneys payable by that person on or\nin respect of that share at the time of forfeiture or surrender, together with interest from the time of forfeiture or surrender until payment at such rate\nas the Board shall decide, in the same manner as if the share had not been forfeited or surrendered. The Board may waive payment of interest\nwholly or in party and may enforce payment, without any reduction or allowance for the value of the shares at the time of\nB-46\nTable of Contents\nforfeiture or for any consideration received on their disposal. Such a person shall also be liable to satisfy all the claims and demands (if any) which\nthe Company might have enforced in respect of the share at the time of forfeiture or surrender. No deduction or allowance shall be made for the\nvalue of the share at the time of forfeiture or surrender or for any consideration received on its disposal.\nSEAL\n108. Seal\n(a)\nThe Company may exercise the powers conferred by the Statutes with regard to having official seals and those powers shall be vested in\nthe Board.\n(b)\nThe Board shall provide for the safe custody of every seal of the Company.\n(c)\nA seal shall be used only by the authority of the Board or a duly authorised committee but that authority may consist of an instruction or\napproval given in hard copy form or in electronic form by a majority of the directors or of the members of a duly authorised committee.\n(d)\nThe Board may determine who shall sign any instrument to which a seal is applied, either generally or in relation to a particular instrument or\ntype of instrument, and may also determine, either generally or in any particular case, that such signatures shall be dispensed with or affixed\nby some mechanical means.\n(e)\nUnless otherwise decided by the Board:\n(i)\ncertificates for shares, debentures or other securities of the Company issued under seal need not be signed\u037e and\n(ii)\nevery other instrument to which a seal is applied shall be signed by at least one director and the secretary or by at least two directors\nor by one director in the presence of a witness who attests the signature.\nDIVIDENDS\n109.

Fixed and interim dividends\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Law, the Board may pay interim dividends and may also pay any dividend payable at a fixed rate at\nintervals settled by the Board whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If the Board acts in\ngood faith, none of the directors shall incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss such holders may suffer in\nconsequence of the payment of an interim dividend on any shares having non-preferred or deferred rights.\n111. Calculation and currency of dividends\n(a)\nExcept insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share otherwise provide:\n(i)\nall dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, but\nno amount paid up on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of this article as paid up on the share\u037e\nB-47\nTable of Contents\n(ii)\nall dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions\nof the period in respect of which the dividend is paid\u037e and\n(iii)\ndividends may be declared or paid in any currency.\n(b)\nThe Board may agree with any member that dividends which may at any time or from time to time be declared or become due on that\nmember\u2019s shares in one currency shall be paid or satisfied in another, and may agree the basis of conversion to be applied and how and\nwhen the amount to be paid in the other currency shall be calculated and paid and for the Company or any other person to bear any costs\ninvolved.\n112. Method of payment\n(a)\nThe Company may pay any dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share by such method as the Board may decide. The Board may\ndecide to use different methods of payment for different holders or groups of holders. Without limiting any other method of payment which\nthe Board may decide upon, the Board may decide that payment can be made, wholly or partly and exclusively or optionally:\n(i)\nby cheque or dividend warrant payable to the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, the holder whose name stands first in the register\nin respect of the relevant share) or to such other person as the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all the joint holders) may notify\nto the Company for the purpose\u037e or\n(ii)\nby a bank or other funds transfer system or by such other electronic means as the Board may decide (including, in the case of an\nuncertificated share, a relevant system) to such account as the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all the joint holders) may notify\nto the Company for the purpose\u037e or\n(iii)\nin such other way as may be agreed between the Company and the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, all such holders).\n(b)\nIf the Board decides that any dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share will be made exclusively by one or more of the methods\nreferred to in paragraph (a)(ii) above to an account, but no such account is nominated by the holder (or, in case of joint holders, all the joint\nholders) or if an attempted payment into a nominated account is rejected or refunded, the Company may treat that dividend or other sum\npayable as unclaimed.\n(c)\nAny such cheque or dividend warrant may be sent by post to the registered address of the holder (or, in the case of joint holders, to the\nregistered address of that person whose name stands first in the register in respect of the relevant share) or to such other address as the\nholder (or, in the case of joint holders, all the joint holders) may notify to the Company for the purpose.\n(d)\nEvery cheque or warrant is sent, and payment in any other way is made, at the risk of the person or persons entitled to it and the Company\nwill not be responsible for any sum lost or delayed when it has sent or transmitted the sum in accordance with these articles. Clearance of a\ncheque or warrant or transmission of funds through a bank or other funds transfer system or by such other electronic means as is permitted\nby these articles shall be a good discharge to the Company.\n(e)\nAny joint holder or other person jointly entitled to any share may give an effective receipt for any dividend or other sum paid in respect of\nthe share.\n(f)\nAny dividend, distribution or other sum payable in respect of any share may be paid to a person or persons entitled by transmission to that\nshare as if that person or those persons were the holder or joint holders of that share and that person\u2019s address (or the address of the first\nnamed of two or more persons jointly entitled) noted in the register were the registered address.\nB-48\nTable of Contents\n113. Dividends not to bear interest\nNo dividend or other moneys payable by the Company on or in respect of any share shall bear interest as against the Company unless otherwise\nprovided by the rights attached to the share.\n114. Calls or debts may be deducted from dividends\nThe Board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to any person (either alone or jointly with another) on or in respect of a share all\nsuch sums as may be due from that person (either alone or jointly with another) to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to\nshares of the Company.\n115. Unclaimed dividends etc.\n(a)\nAll unclaimed dividends, interest or other sums payable may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit of the Company\nuntil claimed. All dividends and any other such monies unclaimed for a period of 10 years after having been declared shall be forfeited and cease to\nremain owing by the Company.\n(b)\nIf the Company exercises its power of sale in accordance with article 129, all dividends and other such monies payable on that share shall be\nforfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company.\n(c)\nThe payment of any unclaimed dividend, interest or other sum payable by the Company on or in respect of any share into a separate account shall\nnot constitute the Company a trustee in respect of it.\n116. Uncashed dividends\nIf:\n(i)\na payment for a dividend or other sum payable in respect of a share sent by the Company to the person entitled to it in accordance\nwith these articles is left uncashed or is returned to the Company or a payment has failed (including where the payment has been\nrejected or refunded) and, after reasonable enquiries, the Company is unable to establish any new address or, with respect to a\npayment to be made by a funds transfer system, a new account, for that person\u037e or\n(ii)\nsuch a payment is left uncashed or returned to the Company or fails (including where the payment has been rejected or refunded) on\ntwo consecutive occasions,\nthe Company shall not be obliged to send any dividends or other sums payable in respect of that share to that person until that person notifies the\nCompany of an address or, where the payment is to be made by a funds transfer system, details of the account, to be used for the purpose.\n117. Dividends in specie\n(a)\nWith the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company and on the recommendation of the Board, payment of any dividend may be\nsatisfied wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of any other company.\n(b)\nWhere any difficulty arises with the distribution, the Board may settle the difficulty as it thinks fit and, in particular, may issue fractional\ncertificates (or ignore fractions), fix the value for distribution of the specific assets or any part of them, determine that cash payments be\nmade to any members on the basis of the value so fixed in order to secure equality of distribution and vest any of the specific assets in\ntrustees on such trusts for the persons entitled to the dividend as the Board may think fit.\n118. Scrip dividends\n(a)\nThe Board may, with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company, offer any holders of any particular class of shares the right to\nelect to receive further shares of that class, credited as fully paid,\nB-49\nTable of Contents\ninstead of cash in respect of all (or some part) of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution (a scrip dividend) in accordance with the\nfollowing provisions of this article.\n(b)\nThe ordinary resolution may specify a particular dividend (whether or not already declared) or may specify all or any dividends declared\nwithin a specified period, but such period may not end later than five years after the date of the meeting at which the ordinary resolution is\npassed.\n(c)\nThe basis of allotment shall be decided by the Board so that, as nearly as may be considered convenient, the value of the further shares,\nincluding any fractional entitlement, is equal to the amount of the cash dividend which would otherwise have been paid (disregarding the\namount of any associated tax credit).\n(d)\nFor the purposes of paragraph (c) above the value of the further shares shall be:\n(i)\nequal to the final reported per share closing price as quoted for a fully paid share of the relevant class, as shown in the NASDAQ\nDaily List for the day on which such shares are first quoted \u201cex\u201d the relevant dividend and the four subsequent dealing days\u037e or\n(ii)\ncalculated in such manner as may be determined by or in accordance with the ordinary resolution.\n(e)\nThe Board shall give notice to the holders of such shares of their rights of election in respect of the scrip dividend and shall specify the\nprocedure to be followed in order to make an election.\n(f)\nThe dividend or that part of it in respect of which an election for the scrip dividend is made shall not be paid and instead further shares of\nthe relevant class shall be allotted in accordance with elections duly made and the Board shall capitalise a sum equal to the aggregate\nnominal amount of the shares to be allotted out of such sums available for the purpose as the Board may consider appropriate.\n(g)\nThe further shares so allotted shall rank pari passu in all respects with the fully paid shares of the same class then in issue except as regards\nparticipation in the relevant dividend.\n(h)\nThe Board may decide that the right to elect for any scrip dividend shall not be made available to members resident in any territory where, in\nthe opinion of the Board, compliance with local laws or regulations would be unduly onerous.\n(i)\nThe Board may do all acts and things as it considers necessary or expedient to give effect to the provisions of a scrip dividend election and\nthe issue of any shares in accordance with the provisions of this article, and may make such provisions as it thinks fit for the case of shares\nbecoming distributable in fractions (including provisions under which, in whole or in part, the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to\nthe Company rather than to the members concerned). To the extent that the entitlement of any holder of shares in respect of any dividend is\nless than the value of one new share of the relevant class (as determined for the basis of any scrip dividend) the Board may also from time\nto time establish or vary a procedure for such entitlement to be accrued and aggregated with any similar entitlement for the purposes of any\nsubsequent scrip dividend.\n(j)\nThe Board may from time to time establish or vary a procedure for election mandates, under which a holder of shares may, in respect of any\nfuture dividends for which a right of election pursuant to this article is offered, elect to receive shares in lieu of such dividend on the terms\nof such mandate.\n(k)\nThe Board shall not make a scrip dividend available unless the Company has sufficient undistributed profits or reserves to give effect to\nelections which could be made to receive that scrip dividend.\n(l)\nThe Board may decide at any time before the further shares are allotted that such shares shall not be allotted and pay the relevant dividend\nin cash instead. Such decision may be made before or after any election has been made by holders of shares in respect of the relevant\ndividend.\nB-50\nTable of Contents\nCAPITALISATION OF RESERVES\n119.

Upon formation, higi SH holdings, Inc. issued\ncommon and preferred shares of stock in return for 100 percent ownership of its operating subsidiary, higi SH LLC (Operating Sub). higi SH Holdings, Inc.\nand its Subsidiaries shall be collectively referred to as (the Company) throughout these consolidated financial statements. The Company is also\ncomprised of the following subsidiaries: higi SH Canada ULC (Higi Canada), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Operating Sub\u037e and EveryMove, Inc.\n(EveryMove), a wholly-owned subsidiary of higi SH holdings, Inc., which was dissolved by the Company in October of 2019.\nThe Company is a consumer health enablement platform that offers connected care and digital navigation solutions.

All significant\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency\nThe Canadian Dollar is the functional currency of the Company\u2019s wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Higi Canada. Assets and liabilities of the foreign\nsubsidiaries whose functional currency are not the United States Dollar (USD) are translated into USD using an exchange rate in effect at the balance\nsheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the year. Equity transactions are translated using historical\nexchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments have been immaterial to date and are included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement\nof operations.\nForeign currency transactions produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A\nchange in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the amount of\nfunctional currency cash flows (cash required) upon settlement of the transaction. Gains and losses for all transactions denominated in a currency other\nthan the functional currency are recognized in the period incurred and included in operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of\noperations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid, short-term investments with a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or\nless.\nThe Company had a cash balance of $789,208 held in foreign bank accounts as of December 31, 2020. The Company has not experienced any losses in\nsuch accounts and management believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risks.\nF-99Table of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at net invoice amounts. Accounts receivable are subject to collection risk. Gross accounts receivable are reduced for this\nrisk by the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specifically identified amounts that the Company believes\nto be uncollectible. If actual collections experience changes, revisions to the allowance may be required. Any unanticipated change in one of those\ncustomers\u2019 credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur. All amounts deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the\nallowance for doubtful accounts in the period that determination is made. Management has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $64,257 as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. The straight-line method is used for computing depreciation and amortization. Costs of maintenance and\nrepairs are charged to expense when incurred. Provisions for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed using straight-line\nmethods over the following estimated useful lives or, for leasehold improvements, the lease term if shorter:\nHigi stations\n3 years\nLeasehold improvements\n3 - 5 years\nSoftware Development Costs\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require the capitalization of qualifying computer software costs,\nwhich are incurred during the application development stage. The Company evaluates internal use software development costs to determine if any costs\nqualify for capitalization. To date, the Company has determined that due to the iterative nature of the development process of new internal use software,\nthe development stage is ongoing. As such, the development costs are expensed in the period they are incurred in the consolidated statement of\noperations.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Trade name of $156,554 as of December 31, 2020, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and is amortized\nover 10 years. The patent license of $106,962 as of December 31, 2020, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and\nis amortized over 10 years.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount should be evaluated. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount\nof an asset in conjunction with its asset group compared to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value. To date, there have been no such losses.\nF-100\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nDeferred Rent Liability\nThe Company records the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line basis and records the difference between rents paid and the straight-\nline rent as a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheet.\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company derives revenues primarily from retail station leases, hosted subscription services, Higi station unit sales and related professional services.\nRevenues are recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected\nto be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

Each identified distinct performance obligation is\nallocated consideration and accounted for separately. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, contingent fees\nor service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a\nsignificant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract or contracts, with a customer\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nRetail Station Lease Revenues\nRetail station revenues are comprised of monthly per station fees that provide retail customers with access to a Higi station and connectivity in locations\nagreed-upon in the customer\u2019s contractual agreement. Customers gain access to a hosted platform on the kiosk station, along with related support and\nupdates during the term of the arrangement. The cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) product allows customers to access their daily health metrics\nthrough the Higi platform.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over-time and applies the \u201cright to invoice\u201d practical expedient on station revenues. As a result, the Company\nrecognizes revenue at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer. The amount corresponds directly with the value transferred\nto the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, in this case number of active stations. The majority of the Company\u2019s customers are\ninvoiced on a monthly basis following the month of the delivery of services, typically payable within 30 days and are required to make payments under\nstandard credit terms. Contracts are generally one year or longer in length and non-cancelable. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in\naccounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nF-101\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNon-Retail Platform & Station Lease Revenues\nNon-retail station and platform service revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with Higi stations, connectivity and access to the\nCompany\u2019s customizable hosted population health services and programs, including on-going data delivery, implementation services and related support\nand updates during the term of the arrangement.\nRevenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer.\nSubscription contracts are generally one year or longer in length, billed in advance or monthly in-arrears and non-cancelable. Amounts that have been\ninvoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred.\nStation Unit Sales\nThe Company sells Higi stations directly to certain customers. Revenue is recognized at a point-in-time for station unit sales once all obligations under\nthe terms of delivery of the stations has been completed.\nProfessional Services Revenues\nProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for installation of Higi stations and other implementation costs. Revenue is generally recognized\nin the period services are transferred to the customer.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may contain multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise in a\ncontract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance\nobligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.\nFor these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if the products or services are often sold separately. The\ntransaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The Company determines SSP by\nconsidering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company\u2019s discounting\npractices, the size and volume of the Company\u2019s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-\nto-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. As the Company\u2019s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices\nin the future, which could result in changes to SSP.\nIn certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to\nsimilar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices.\nContract Assets and Deferred Revenues\nThe timing and amount of revenue recognition may differ in certain situations from the billing terms due to the pattern of delivery for each identified\ndistinct performance obligation. The Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings and deferred revenue\nwhen the billings on a contract\nF-102\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nexceed the revenue recognized. The Company has no recorded contract assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Customer\npayments received in advance of revenue recognition are contract liabilities and are recorded as deferred revenue.\nIncremental Costs\nThe Company\u2019s incremental costs of fulfilling a contract primarily consist of costs associated with installation and delivery of Higi stations to customers.\nFulfillment costs are expensed as incurred as installation services are recognized at a point-in-time as a separate distinct performance obligation.\nCost of Revenues\nCosts of the SaaS platform primarily consist of the costs of hosting the SaaS product, platform related software and integration fees, connectivity and\nmaintenance, shipping and installation and depreciation expense associated with the Higi stations. Hosting costs, platform related software and\nintegration fees are expensed as incurred based upon actual usage. Connectivity and maintenance, shipping and installation costs are expensed as\nincurred upon the go-live of the station kiosks at the customer\u2019s locations. Provisions for depreciation of Higi stations are computed using straight-line\nmethods over the estimated term of the arrangement.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising expense was $6,064 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires all stock-based compensation to\nemployees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on\nthe their grant date fair values.\nCompensation expense related to awards is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the\naward, which is generally the vesting term. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of options\ngranted. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the number of shares granted and the fair value on the date of grant determined by an\nindependent third party.\nSales Tax\nThe Company\u2019s lease and platform based revenues from Higi stations and SaaS contracts may be subject to sales tax in certain states. The Company\ncharges and collects sales tax, when appropriate, from customers in the United States. Revenues are reported net of such amounts. Collected taxes are\nremitted to the appropriate state or local entity on a periodic basis. The Company\u2019s terms and conditions with its customers contain provisions allowing\nthe Company to bill its customers for sales based tax if it is owed. For jurisdictions where the Company has accrued such estimated liabilities, the actual\nliabilities upon final settlement may differ based upon the jurisdictions\u2019 conclusion on the taxability of the Company\u2019s revenue and the Company\u2019s\nopportunities to mitigate such liabilities. The Company has accrued an estimated liability of $94,723 as of December 31, 2020. In certain other jurisdictions,\nwhile the Company believes that its revenue is not subject to sales tax, the Company\u2019s position may be challenged by state and local taxing authorities.\nNo amounts have been recorded related to such situations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nF-103\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nInternational Taxes\nThe Company is required to pay a non-resident withholding tax on revenues derived from Canadian based customers. This tax is included in income taxes\non the consolidated statement of operations. Total unpaid non-resident withholding taxes was $85,334 as of December 31, 2020. The Company is\nresponsible for collecting and remitting a goods and services tax (GST) and harmonized sales tax (HST) on services provided to their customers located in\nCanada. Total unpaid GST/HST was $34,031 as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company classifies all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. When\napplicable, interest and penalties incurred on uncertain tax positions are calculated based on guidance from the relevant tax authority and included in\nincome tax expense.\nThe Company is subject to the accounting standard for uncertainty in income taxes. The tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in\nthe consolidated financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe Company recognizes the consolidated financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more\nlikely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized, upon ultimate settlement with the\nrelevant tax authority. The Company\u2019s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company is subject to the accounting standard for fair value measurements, which provides a framework for measuring, reporting and disclosing fair\nvalue. This applies to all assets and liabilities that are measured, reported and/or disclosed on a fair value basis.\nThe Company\u2019s short-term financial instruments consist of the following: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts\npayable. The carrying values of these short-term financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values based on the instruments\u2019 short-term\nnature.\nThe recorded values of convertible promissory notes, note payable and related party convertible promissory notes approximate their fair values, as\ninterest approximates market rates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nF-104\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the\nstatement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying\nasset for the lease term. During 2018, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient, which permits an entity to elect an\noptional transition practical expedient to not evaluate land easements that existed or expired before the entity\u2019s adoption of Topic 842 and that were not\npreviously accounted for under ASC 840\u037e ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which addresses narrow aspects of the\nguidance originally issued in ASU No. 2016- 02\u037e ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, which provides entities with an additional (and optional) transition\nmethod whereby an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening\nbalance of retained earnings in the period of adoption and also provides lessors with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate\nnonlease components from the associated lease component and, instead, to account for those components as a single component\u037e and ASU No. 2018-20,\nNarrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, which addresses sales and other similar taxes collected from lessees, certain lessor costs and the recognition of\nvariable payments for contracts with lease and nonlease components. Topic 842 (as amended) is effective for annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the\neffect that Topic 842 (as amended) will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuring August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\nThat Is a Service Contract. ASU No. 2018-15 requires an entity (customer) in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance of\nSubtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The\namendments also require the entity (customer) to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over\nthe term of the hosting arrangement and apply the existing impairment guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to the capitalized implementation costs as if the costs\nwere long-lived assets. Lastly, the amendment addresses the presentation of expenses in the statement of income, payments in the statement of cash\nflows and capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position. ASU No. 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2020 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing\nthe effect that ASU No. 2018-15 will have on its consolidated results of operation, financial position and cash flows.\n2.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment consist of the following at December 31, 2020:\nHigi Stations\n$\n42,985,661\nLeasehold improvements\n6,688\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(42,847,723)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n144,626\nDepreciation expense was $151,726 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

This has adversely impacted global economic activity and contributed to significant declines and\nvolatility in financial markets.\nOn March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) was enacted. The\nCARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic\nF-106\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nstimulus package, which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions applicable to U.S. income tax. Some of these tax provisions are\nexpected to be effective retroactively for years ending before the date of enactment. The Company is currently evaluating the implications of the Act and\nits impact on the financial statements.\nIn response to the pandemic, on April 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $1,000,400 under the Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP) which was established as part of the CARES Act and is administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA). The PPP provides loans to\nqualifying businesses in amounts up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll expenses and was designed to provide a direct financial incentive for\nqualifying businesses to keep their workforce employed during the Coronavirus crisis. PPP loans are uncollateralized and guaranteed by the SBA and are\nforgivable after a \u201ccovered period\u201d (eight or twenty-four weeks) as long as the borrower maintains its payroll levels and uses the loan proceeds for\neligible expenses, including payroll, benefits, mortgage interest, rent and utilities. The forgiveness amount will be reduced if the borrower terminates\nemployees or reduces salaries and wages more than 25 percent during the covered period. Any unforgiven portion is payable over two years if issued\nbefore or five years if issued after, June 5, 2020 at an interest rate of one percent with payments deferred until the SBA remits the borrower\u2019s loan\nforgiveness amount to the lender or, if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness, ten months after the end of the covered period. PPP loan terms\nprovide for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties and insolvency events and may be\naccelerated upon the occurrence of one or more of these events of default. Additionally, PPP loan terms do not include prepayment penalties.\nThe Company met the PPP\u2019s loan forgiveness requirements and therefore, applied for forgiveness during November of 2020. On April 1, 2021, the\nCompany received legal release from the SBA and therefore, will record the amount forgiven, $1,000,400, as forgiveness income within the other income\nsection in its 2021 statement of operations.\nThe SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP loan, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance with the\nCARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in full and to\nprovide that documentation to the SBA upon request.\n6.\nPromissory Notes\nSenior Secured Promissory Notes issued October 2016\nIn October 2016, the Company issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $10,000,000 to an existing investor (the Senior Note). Pursuant to a\nSecurity Agreement executed with the lender, the Senior Note was secured by certain assets of the Company. Interest accrued at the annual rate of LIBOR\nplus 5 percent. The Senior Note had a maturity date of October 26, 2022.

The principal items which cause the Company\u2019s effective tax rate to vary from the U.S. statutory rate are state income taxes,\npermanent items consisting primarily of goodwill and net operating loss carryforward utilization.\nThe components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of December 31, 2020:\nDeferred income tax assets:\nProperty and equipment\n$\n247,464\nGoodwill\n10,050\nReserves and accruals\n264,966\nFederal and state net operating loss carryforwards\n13,235,475\nStock compensation\n17,995\nCharitable contributions\n2,919\nTotal deferred income tax assets\n13,778,869\nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets\n(46,318)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities\n(46,318)\nNet deferred income tax assets\n13,732,551\nValuation allowance\n(13,732,551)\nTotal net deferred income tax assets\n$\n\u2014\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company has federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $65,241,172. A portion of the federal net\noperating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031. At December 31, 2020, the Company has state NOL carryforwards of $21,934,791. The state NOL\ncarryforwards begin to expire in 2029.\nFederal and state NOL carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or that\ncould occur in the future, as required by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as well as similar state provisions. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d as\ndefined by the IRC results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50\npercentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Since the Company\u2019s formation, the Company has\nraised capital through the issuance of capital stock which may have resulted in an ownership change or could result in an ownership change in the future\nupon subsequent disposition. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, during the periods in which those temporary\ndifferences become deductible. The Company has established a valuation allowance against its total deferred tax assets as there is uncertainty the assets\nmay not be utilized before expiration. The allowance is subject to change based upon the Company\u2019s continued operating performance.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had no uncertain tax benefits. The Company\u2019s estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is\nsubject to management\u2019s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions to\ndetermine if it is\nF-114\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nmore-likely-than-not that they would be sustained upon examination. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits\nin the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. The Company remains subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax\nauthorities for the years 2016 through 2020. There are no pending examinations in any jurisdiction.\n10.\nMajor Customers\nFour of the Company\u2019s customers accounted for approximately 47 percent of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The customers\naccounted for approximately 55 percent of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020.

Stock Incentive Plan (the Option Plan) after the recapitalization and\nreorganization. The purpose of the Option Plan is to enable the Company to attract, retain, reward and motivate individuals by providing them with an\nopportunity to acquire and increase proprietary interest in the Company and to incentivize them to expend maximum effort for the growth and success of\nthe Company. The Option Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity-\nbased awards to its employees, consultants, service providers and directors for up to 3,169,982 shares of common stock. On March 15, 2020, the Board\napproved an additional 13,404,722 shares of common stock of the Company for a total of 16,574,704 shares reserved for issuance under the Option Plan.\nThe Company has granted 7,310,746 Non-Voting Common Units under Incentive Unit Agreements (IUA\u2019s or options) through December 31, 2020. The\nIUAs are designed to serve as an incentive for attracting and retaining employees, officers, investors and advisors. The Company determines the grant\nand vesting terms as of the grant date. The exercise price of the options shall be fixed by the Board and stated in the respective IUA, provided that the\nexercise price of the shares of common stock subject to such option may not be less than fair market value of the common stock on the grant date or if\ngreater, the par value of the common stock. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the Option Plan to an employee who at the time of\ngrant is a holder of at least 10 percent of total company stock and to any other employee must be equal to at least 110 percent and 100 percent,\nrespectively, of the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors.

The weighted-average\ngrant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.01.\nRestricted Stock Units\nOn March 15, 2018, the Company issued 5,000 shares of restricted stock, after recapitalization and reorganization, to a Board member with 1,250 shares\nvesting on the first anniversary of the commencement date and the remaining shares vesting ratably each month until the 48th month anniversary. No\nrestricted stock units were granted under the Option Plan during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPerformance-Based Stock Warrants\nThe Company previously issued performance-based stock warrants to purchase up to 26,000 shares of non-voting common stock, after recapitalization\nand reorganization. The performance-based warrants become exercisable upon achievement of certain milestones as described in the warrant document.\nAs of December 31, 2020, none of the milestones for the performance-based warrants had been met. Since none of the warrants became exercisable, no\namounts were charged to stock compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-Voting Common Units Reserved for Future Issuance\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had reserved shares of non-voting common stock for future issuance as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\nAvailable for grant at December 31, 2019\n2,510,698\nAdditional authorized\n13,404,722\nStock options granted\n(6,567,816)\nStock options forfeited\n106,852\nAvailable for grant at December 31, 2020\n9,454,456\nThe Company received cash of $6,156 for 6,840 stock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nF-116\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company estimated the fair value of each option award utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following\ntable. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the industry. The expected term of options granted is based on the contractual expiration date\nof the options. The risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time\nof grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The following assumptions were used for options granted during the year ended December\n31, 2020:\nExpected volatility\n100 percent\nExpected dividends\nN/A\nExpected life of option (in years)\n6.25\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.50 percent\nThe amount charged to stock compensation expense was $60,463 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there was $29,495 of\nunrecognized compensation cost related to service-based non-vested stock options granted under the Option Plan. The unrecognized compensation cost\nis expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of three years.\nStock Option Repricing\nIn November 2020, the Board of Directors approved a common stock option repricing program whereby previously granted and unexercised options held\nby current employees with exercise prices above $0.01 per share were repriced to $0.01 per share, which represented the per share fair value of the\ncommon stock as of the date of the repricing. There was no other modification to the vesting schedule of the previously issued options. As a result,\n542,136 unexercised options originally granted to purchase common stock were repriced under this program.\nThe Company treated the repricing as a modification of the original awards and calculated compensation costs for the difference between the fair value of\nthe modified award and the fair value of the original award on the modification date. The repricing did not result in incremental stock-based compensation\nexpense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expense related to vested shares was expensed on the repricing date and expense related to unvested\nshares is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of such stock options.\n12.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan to employees of the Company. The Company may match contributions at its discretion. There were no matching\ncontributions made by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nF-117\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\n13.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sum to the\ntotal same such amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n7,211,024\nRestricted cash\n272,404\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statement\nof cash flows\n$\n7,483,428\nSupplemental Cash Flow Disclosures\nCash paid for interest\n$\n1,189,474\nCash paid for income taxes\n$\n106,512\nNoncash Investing and Financing Activities\nConversion of promissory notes to Series B Preferred Stock\n$\n14,408,988\n14.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through August 24, 2021, the date the consolidated financial statements were approved to be issued, for\nevents that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company\u2019s growth was funded through issuance of additional shares of Series B Preferred by an executed agreement with a new\ninvestor.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the\n\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nNew York, NY\nMarch 29, 2021\nF-120\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.",

(formerly known as Ark Global Acquisition Corp.) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December\n1, 2020. On March 5, 2021, Alkuri filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate name from Ark Global Acquisition\nCorp. to Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp., effective March 8, 2021. Alkuri was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange,\nasset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d).\nAlkuri is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, Alkuri is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth\ncompanies.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Alkuri had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from December 1, 2020 (inception) through\nDecember 31, 2020 relates to Alkuri\u2019s formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d). Alkuri will not generate any operating\nrevenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. Alkuri will generate non-operating income on cash and cash\nequivalents in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe registration statement for Alkuri\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, Alkuri consummated\nthe Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the \u201cPublic\nShares\u201d), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating\ngross proceeds of $345,000,000, which is described in Note 3.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, Alkuri consummated the sale of 5,933,333 warrants (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement\nWarrant\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Ark Sponsor LLC\n(the \u201cSponsor\u201d), generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000, which is described in Note 4.\nTransaction costs amounted to $19,500,194, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $525,194 of\nother offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, an amount of $345,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the\nsale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a Trust Account, invested in U.S. government\nsecurities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended\ninvestment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), as determined by Alkuri, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the\ndistribution of the funds in the Trust Account to Alkuri\u2019s stockholders, as described below, except that the interest earned on the Trust Account can be\nreleased to Alkuri to pay its tax obligation.\nAlkuri\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of\nthe Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business\nCombination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value\nequal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest\nearned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. Alkuri intends to complete a Business\nCombination if the\nF-125Table of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\npost-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling\ninterest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nAlkuri will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their\nPublic Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business\nCombination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether Alkuri will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a\ntender offer will be made by Alkuri, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of\nthe amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust\nAccount and not previously released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business\nCombination with respect to Alkuri\u2019s warrants.\nAlkuri will proceed with a Business Combination only if Alkuri has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such\nconsummation of a Business Combination and, if Alkuri seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business\nCombination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and Alkuri does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, Alkuri will,\npursuant to its Charter (the \u201cAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however,\nstockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or Alkuri decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, Alkuri will\noffer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If Alkuri seeks\napproval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after\nthe Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares\nirrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or don\u2019t vote at all.\nNotwithstanding the above, if Alkuri seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the\ntender offer rules, the Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such\nstockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)),\nwill be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of\nAlkuri.\nThe Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the\ncompletion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if Alkuri fails to complete a Business\nCombination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Charter (i) to modify the\nsubstance or timing of Alkuri\u2019s obligation to allow redemption in connection with Alkuri\u2019s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public\nShares if Alkuri does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial\nbusiness combination activity, unless Alkuri provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any\nsuch amendment.\nAlkuri will have until February 9, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d). If Alkuri is unable to complete a Business\nCombination within the Combination Period, Alkuri will (i) cease all\nF-126\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\noperations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the\nPublic Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the\nfunds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to Alkuri to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution\nexpenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as\nstockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such\nredemption, subject to the approval of Alkuri\u2019s remaining stockholders and Alkuri\u2019s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to\nAlkuri\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights\nor liquidating distributions with respect to Alkuri\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within the\nCombination Period.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within\nthe Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to\nliquidating distributions from the Trust Account if Alkuri fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have\nagreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event Alkuri does not complete a\nBusiness Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account\nthat will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets\nremaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to Alkuri if and to the extent any claims by a third\nparty for services rendered or products sold to Alkuri, or a prospective target business with which Alkuri has discussed entering into a transaction\nagreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the\nTrust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest\nwhich may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all\nrights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under Alkuri\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public Offering\nagainst certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Moreover, in the event that an executed\nwaiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.\nThe Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to\nhave all vendors, service providers (except Alkuri\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with\nwhich Alkuri does business, execute agreements with Alkuri waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust\nAccount.\nLiquidity and Management\u2019s Plan\nPrior to the completion of the initial public offering, Alkuri lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which\nis considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statement. The Company has since competed its Initial Public Offering at which time\ncapital in excess of the funds deposited in the Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to Alkuri for general working capital\npurposes. On March 26, 2021, Alkuri\u2019s cash position is approximately $315,000. On\nF-127\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nMarch 25, 2021, our Sponsor committed to provide us with an aggregate of $650,000 in loans. The loans, if issued, will be non-interest bearing, unsecured\nand will be repaid upon the consummation of a Business Combination. If Alkuri does not consummate a business combination, all amounts loaned to\nAlkuri will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the Trust Account to repay such loans. Accordingly, management has\nsince reevaluated Alkuri\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and determined that sufficient capital exists to sustain operations through for a reasonable\nperiod of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements and therefore substantial doubt has been alleviated.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus\ncould have a negative effect on Alkuri\u2019s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily\ndeterminable as of the date of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nNOTE 2 \u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered\npublic accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Alkuri\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a\ncondition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,\ncould change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nF-128\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs consisted of legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that were directly related to the\nInitial Public Offering. On February 9, 2021, offering costs amounting to $19,500,194 were charged to stockholders\u2019 equity upon the completion of the\nInitial Public Offering (see Note 1). As of December 31, 2020, there were $247,735 of deferred offering costs recorded in the accompanying balance sheet.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The Company complies with the accounting and\nreporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income\ntaxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that\nwill result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to\naffect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax\npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained\nupon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax\nexpense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020. The Company is currently\nnot aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nThe provision for income taxes was deemed to be immaterial as of December 31, 2020.\nNet Loss Per Common Share\nNet loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares\nof Class B common stock that are subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriter (see Note 5). At\nDecember 31, 2020, Alkuri did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock\nand then share in the earnings of Alkuri. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject Alkuri to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at\ntimes, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company had not experienced losses on this account and management\nbelieves Alkuri is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\nF-129\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of Alkuri\u2019s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, \u201cFair Value Measurement,\u201d\napproximates the carrying amounts represented in Alkuri\u2019s balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material\neffect on Alkuri\u2019s financial statements.\nNOTE 3 \u2014 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, Alkuri sold 34,500,000 Units, which includes a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option\nin the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Alkuri\u2019s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par\nvalue, and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (\u201cPublic Warrant\u201d). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common\nstock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).\nNOTE 4 \u2014 PRIVATE PLACEMENT\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants at a\nprice of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant ($8,900,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement. Each Private Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase\none share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. $6,900,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added\nto the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account and $2,000,000 of proceeds were held outside of the trust to pay certain\noffering costs and for use as working capital. If Alkuri does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the\nsale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the\nPrivate Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nNOTE 5 \u2014 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFounder Shares\nOn December 17, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 for the purchase of 7,187,500 shares of Class B common stock Founder Shares. On February 4,\n2021, Alkuri effected a 1.2-for-1 stock split of its Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder\nShares included an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment was not\nexercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of Alkuri\u2019s issued and outstanding shares after the\nInitial Public Offering. As a result of the underwriters\u2019 election to fully exercise their over-allotment option on February 9, 2021, no Founder Shares are\ncurrently subject to forfeiture.\nThe Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of:\n(1) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (2) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of Alkuri\u2019s\nClass A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,\nF-130\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nrecapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y)\nthe date on which Alkuri completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of Alkuri\u2019s stockholders\nhaving the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nAdvances from Related Party\nThe Sponsor paid for certain costs ($4,220 as of December 31, 2020) on behalf of Alkuri in connection with its formation and the Initial Public\nOffering. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2020 was repaid prior to the closing of the Initial Public Offering. During 2021, the Sponsor made\nadditional advances of $1,194,375 on behalf of Alkuri, these additional advances were repaid subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering on\nFebruary 10, 2021.\nAdministrative Support Agreement\nThe Company agreed, commencing on February 4, 2021 through the earlier of Alkuri\u2019s consummation of a Business Combination or its liquidation,\nto pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.\nPromissory Note \u2014 Related Party\nOn December 17, 2020, the Sponsor loaned Alkuri an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to\na promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the completion of the Initial Public\nOffering. As of December 31, 2020, Alkuri had $300,000 outstanding under the Note which was repaid subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public\nOffering on February 10, 2021.\nRelated Party Loans\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of Alkuri\u2019s\ndirectors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan Alkuri funds as may be required (\u201cWorking Capital Loans\u201d). If Alkuri completes a Business\nCombination, Alkuri would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to Alkuri. Otherwise, the Working Capital\nLoans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, Alkuri may use a\nportion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to\nrepay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written\nagreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without\ninterest, or, at the lender\u2019s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination\nentity at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.\nNOTE 6 \u2014 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nRegistration Rights\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 4, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and\nany warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of\nthe Private Placement Warrants\nF-131\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nand warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will have registration rights to\nrequire Alkuri to register a sale of any of the securities held by them. These holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands,\nexcluding short form registration demands, that Alkuri register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have\n\u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us, subject to certain limitations. The registration rights\nagreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering Alkuri\u2019s securities. The\nCompany will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $12,075,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the\nunderwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that Alkuri completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the\nunderwriting agreement.\nNOTE 7\u2014STOCKHOLDER\u2019S EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\u2014The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock.

In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed\nissued in connection with a Business Combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will\nequal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of\nthe Initial Public Offering, plus the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of\nany equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Alkuri in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business\nCombination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common\nstock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or\ndirectors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans\u037e provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one for one basis.\nThe Company cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of the Class B common stock at the time of any future issuance would agree\nto waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio.\nF-132\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nWarrants \u2014 Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on December 1, 2020. The Company was\nformed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business\ncombination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the\nCompany is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period ending June 30, 2021 relates to the Company\u2019s\nformation, the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a\ntarget company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business\nCombination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income on cash and cash equivalents in the form of interest income from the\nproceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe registration statement for the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, the Company\nconsummated the Initial Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units\nsold, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per\nUnit, generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000, which is described in Note 3.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,933,333 warrants (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement\nWarrant\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Ark Sponsors\nLLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000, which is described in Note 4.\nTransaction costs amounted to $19,500,194, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $525,194 of\nother offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, an amount of $345,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the\nsale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d),\ninvested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or\nless, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a\nBusiness Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company\u2019s stockholders, as described below, except that the\ninterest earned on the Trust Account can be released to the Company to pay its tax obligation.\nThe Company\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the\nsale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a\nBusiness Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair\nmarket value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable\non interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company intends to\ncomplete a Business\nF-140Table of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nCombination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise\nacquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion\nof their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business\nCombination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or\nconduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a\npro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds\nheld in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion\nof a Business Combination with respect to the Company\u2019s warrants.\nThe Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon\nsuch consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the\nBusiness Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other\nreasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cAmended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer\ndocuments with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the\nCompany decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy\nsolicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks approval in connection with a Business\nCombination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of\napproving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or\nagainst the proposed transaction or don\u2019t vote at all.\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant\nto the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such\nstockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the\nPublic Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.\nThe Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the\ncompletion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business\nCombination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company\u2019s\ninitial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any\nother provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the\nopportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.\nThe Company will have until February 9, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d). If the Company is unable to\ncomplete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the\nF-141\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nCompany will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days\nthereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including\ninterest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of\ninterest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public\nstockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible\nfollowing such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s remaining stockholders and the Company\u2019s board of directors, dissolve and\nliquidate, subject in each case to the Company\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other\napplicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company\u2019s warrants, which will expire worthless if the\nCompany fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination\nwithin the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to\nliquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The\nunderwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company\ndoes not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in\nthe Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share\nvalue of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a\nthird party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into\na transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share\nheld in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the\ninterest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any\nand all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public\nOffering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Moreover, in the event that an\nexecuted waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party\nclaims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by\nendeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses\nor other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or\nto monies held in the Trust Account.\nMerger Agreement\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among the Company, Babylon Holdings Limited, Liberty USA\nMerger Sub, Inc. and, solely for purposes of Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement, each of Alkuri Sponsors LLC and Dr. Ali Parsadoust. The Merger\nAgreement was unanimously approved by the Company\u2019s board of directors on June 2, 2021. If the Merger Agreement is\nF-142\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\napproved by the Company\u2019s shareholders, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated, Merger Sub will merge with\nand into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Babylon. Pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, each share of Company common stock (excluding shares held in treasury by the Company) will be automatically converted into the right to\nreceive one (1) Class A ordinary shares (the \u201cPubco Class A Shares\u201d) of Pubco.\nThe Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion, and prior to the closing\nof the Business Combination (the \u201cClosing\u201d), each outstanding share of Babylon will be reclassified into Pubco Class A Shares, other than the existing\nBabylon Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Class B ordinary shares (the \u201cPubco Class B Shares\u201d) of Pubco. As a result of the reclassification,\neach outstanding Pubco Class A Share and Pubco Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the $3.515\nbillion equity value of Babylon). At the Closing, the Pubco Class B shares will be held by Dr. Ali Parasdoust, ALP Partners Limited, Parsa Family\nFoundation (collectively, the \u201cFounder\u201d) or a founder permitted transferee. The Pubco Class B shares will have the same economic terms as the Pubco\nClass A shares, but the Pubco Class B shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Pubco Class A Share will have 1 vote per share).\nIn addition, in connection with the Closing, the Company will issue at the closing (i) to the Founder, 38,800,000 Pubco Class B Shares (the \u201cStockholder\nEarnout Shares\u201d) and (ii) to the Sponsor, 1,293,750 Pubco Class A shares that the Sponsor would otherwise receive as consideration for the Merger (the\n\u201cSponsor Earnout Shares\u201d and together with the Stockholder Earnout Shares, the \u201cEarnout Shares\u201d). The Earnout Shares will be subject to milestones\n(based on the achievement of certain price targets of Pubco Class A shares following the Closing). In the event such milestones are not met, all of the\nEarnout Shares will be automatically converted into redeemable shares of Pubco which Pubco can redeem for $1.00.\nSubscription Agreements\nAdditionally, the Company and Babylon entered into subscription agreements, each dated as of June 3, 2021, with certain investors, pursuant to\nwhich, among other things, Babylon agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 23,000,000\nPubco Class A shares for $10 per share. The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements, including the consummation of the Business\nCombination.\nEntities affiliated with the Sponsor have agreed to purchase 1,300,000 Pubco Class A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on\nsubstantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. Entities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust have agreed to purchase 200,000 Pubco\nClass A Shares pursuant to a Subscription Agreement on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. Entities affiliated with\nVNV Global AB and Kinnevik AB have each agreed to purchase 500,000 Pubco Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the\nsame terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors.\nAs of the date hereof, issuance or sale of the Pubco Class A Shares in connection with the Subscription Agreements has not been registered under\nthe Securities Act. The Company has agreed, within 15 calendar days of Closing to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of such\nPubco Class A Shares and will use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but\nin any event no later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) calendar days (or ninety (90) calendar days if the SEC notifies the Company that it will \u201creview\u201d the\nregistration statement) following the Closing and\nF-143\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\n(ii) the tenth (10th) business day after the date the Company is notified (in writing) by the SEC that the registration statement will not be \u201creviewed\u201d or\nwill not be subject to further review.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nAt June 30, 2021, we have $70,821 in its operating bank accounts, $345,022,618 in securities held in the Trust Account, to be for a Business\nCombination or to repurchase or redeem its ordinary shares in connection therewith and working capital of ($3,126,669).\nUntil the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and\nevaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the\ntarget business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating, and consummating the Business Combination.\nIf the Business Combination is not consummated, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its\nSponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company\u2019s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the\nCompany funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company\u2019s working\ncapital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be\nrequired to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the\npursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it\non commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern through\none year from the date of these financial statements if a Business Combination is not consummated. These financial statements do not include any\nadjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable\nto continue as a going concern.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus\ncould have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not\nreadily determinable as of the date of the financial statement. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation\nS-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been\ncondensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information\nand footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the\nF-144\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\naccompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair\npresentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe period ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be\nread in conjunction with the Company\u2019s prospectus for its Initial Public Offering as filed with the SEC on February 9, 2021. The interim results for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021 or for any\nfuture periods.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered\npublic accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial\naccounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a\nclass of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act\nprovides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth\ncompanies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that\nwhen a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company,\ncan adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of\nusing the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company\u2019s management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a\ncondition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,\ncould change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nF-145\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The\nCompany did not have any cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nMarketable Securities Held in Trust Account\nAt June 30, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S.\nTreasury securities. Interest income is recognized when earned. The Company\u2019s portfolio of marketable securities is comprised solely of U.S. government\nsecurities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended\ninvestment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4)\nof Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $345 million was placed in the\nTrust Account and invested in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities. All of the Company\u2019s investments held in the Trust\nAccount are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains\nand losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in\nTrust Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using\navailable market information.\nOffering Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering\nThe Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) Topic 5A\u2014\u201cExpenses of\nOffering\u201d. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date. Offering costs are allocated to\nthe separable financial instruments issued in the IPO based on a relative fair value basis compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs associated\nwith warrant liabilities is expensed, and offering costs associated with the Class A ordinary share are charged to the shareholders\u2019 equity. Accordingly, as\nof June 30, 2021, offering costs in the aggregate of $18,855,156 have been charged to shareholders\u2019 equity and $645,038 of offering costs associated with\nwarrant and forward purchase unit issuance cost has been expensed on the Company\u2019s statement of operations.\nClass A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards\nCodification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480 \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\u201d Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified\nas a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights\nthat is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company\u2019s control)\nis classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders\u2019 equity. The Company\u2019s Class A common stock features\ncertain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company\u2019s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly,\nat June 30, 2021, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders\u2019\nequity section of the Company\u2019s balance sheet.\nWarrant Liability\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant\u2019s specific\nterms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting\nF-146\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nStandards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (\u201cASC 480\u201d) and ASC 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging (\u201cASC 815\u201d). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the\ndefinition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including\nwhether the warrants are indexed to the Company\u2019s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which\nrequires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the\nwarrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of\nadditional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are\nrequired to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the\nwarrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a Modified Black\nScholes approach which includes a Monte Carlo simulation (see Note 9).\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities\nof a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions\ntaken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nThere were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Company is\ncurrently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is\nsubject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 due to the valuation allowance recorded on the Company\u2019s net operating losses and permanent differences.\nNet loss per Common Share\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,\nexcluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and\nprivate placement to purchase an aggregate of 14,558,333 shares in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants are\ncontingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.\nThe Company\u2019s statement of operations includes a presentation of loss per share for common stock subject to possible redemption in a manner\nsimilar to the two-class method of loss per share. Net loss per common share,\nF-147\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nbasic and diluted, for Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is calculated by dividing the proportionate share of loss on marketable\nsecurities held by the Trust Account by the weighted average number of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption outstanding since\noriginal issuance.\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss, adjusted for loss on marketable\nsecurities attributable to Class A common stock subject to possible redemption, by the weighted average number of non-redeemable common stock\noutstanding for the period.\nNon-redeemable common stock includes Founder Shares and non-redeemable shares of common stock as these shares do not have any redemption\nfeatures.

The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, \u201cFair Value Measurement,\u201d\napproximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The\nhierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest\npriority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\n\u2022\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets\u037e\n\u2022\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices\nfor similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active\u037e and\n\u2022\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own\nassumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are\nunobservable.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those\ninstances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair\nvalue measurement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded\nderivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the\nderivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value\nreported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as\nliabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current\nbased on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material\neffect on the Company\u2019s condensed financial statements.\nF-149\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06- Contracts in Entity\u2019s\nOwn Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that\nrequire separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception\nguidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for\nconvertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity\u2019s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per\nshare guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and\nshould be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently\nassessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNOTE 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 34,500,000 Units, which includes a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment\noption in the amount of 4,500,000 Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock,\n$0.0001 par value, and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (\u201cPublic Warrant\u201d). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment (see Note 8).\nNOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,933,333 Private Placement Warrants at a\nprice of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant ($8,900,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement. Each Private Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase\none share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net\nproceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination\nPeriod, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements\nof applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFounder Shares\nOn December 17, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 for the purchase of 7,187,500 shares of Class B common stock (the \u201cFounder Shares\u201d). On\nFebruary 4, 2021, the Company effected a 1.2-for-1 stock split of its Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares\noutstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters\u2019\nover-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company\u2019s issued and\noutstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. As a result of the underwriters\u2019 election to fully exercise their over-allotment option on February 9,\n2021, no Founder Shares are currently subject to forfeiture.\nThe Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of:\n(1) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the\nCompany\u2019s Class A common\nF-150\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nstock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading\ndays within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a\nliquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company\u2019s stockholders having the right to exchange their\nshares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nDue from Sponsor\nAt the closing of the Initial Public Offering on February 9, 2021, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants in the\namount of $2,000,000 was due to the Company to be held outside of the Trust Account for working capital purposes. Such amount was paid by the\nSponsor to the Company on February 10, 2021.\nAdvances from Related Party\nAs of February 9, 2021, the Sponsor paid for certain offering costs on behalf of the Company in connection with the Initial Public Offering. As of\nJune 30, 2021, the Company had no outstanding advances from the Sponsor. The outstanding balance under these advances was repaid subsequent to\nthe closing of the Initial Public Offering, on February 10, 2021.\nSponsor Commitment\nOn May 12, 2021, our Sponsor committed to provide us with an aggregate of $650,000 in loans through May 31, 2022. The loans, if issued, will be\nnon-interest bearing, unsecured and will be repaid upon the consummation of an initial business combination. If the Company does not consummate an\ninitial business combination, all amounts loaned to the Company will be forgiven except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the Trust\nAccount to repay such loans.\nAdministrative Services Agreement\nThe Company agreed, commencing on February 4, 2021 through the earlier of the Company\u2019s consummation of a Business Combination or its\nliquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. For the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred and paid $20,000 and $50,000 in fees for these services respectively.\nPromissory Note\u2014Related Party\nOn December 17, 2020, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public\nOffering pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the\ncompletion of the Initial Public Offering. As of February 9, 2021, the Company had $300,000 outstanding under the Note. The outstanding balance under\nthe Note of $300,000 was repaid subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering, on February 10, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, there was no balance\noutstanding under the Promissory Note.\nRelated Party Loans\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the\nCompany\u2019s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan the\nF-151\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nCompany funds as may be required (\u201cWorking Capital Loans\u201d). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the\nWorking Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only\nout of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held\noutside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital\nLoans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect\nto such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender\u2019s\ndiscretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.50\nper warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no\noutstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.\nNOTE 6. COMMITMENTS\nRegistration Rights\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 4, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and\nany warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of\nthe Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares)\nwill have registration rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of the securities held by them. These holders of these securities will be\nentitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities for sale under the Securities\nAct. In addition, these holders will have \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us, subject to\ncertain limitations. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in\nregistering the Company\u2019s securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $ 12,075,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the\nunderwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of\nthe underwriting agreement.\nNOTE 7.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting\nperiod, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities reflects management\u2019s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in\nconnection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs\n(market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants\nwould price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and\nunobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1:\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which\ntransactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing\nbasis.\nLevel 2:\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar\nassets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3:\nUnobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability.\nAt June 30, 2021, assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of $345,022,618 in money market funds which are primarily invested in U.S.\nTreasury securities. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account.\nF-155\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nThe following table presents information about the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30,\n2021 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.\nDescription\nLevel\nJune 30, 2021\nAssets:\nCash and marketable securities held in Trust Account\n1\n$ 345,022,618\nLiabilities:\nWarrant Liability - Public Warrants\n1\n12,592,500\nWarrant Liability - Private Placement Warrants\n3\n8,900,000\nThe Warrants are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Public Warrants were initially valued using Modified Black Scholes model which\nincludes a Monte Carlo simulation. As of June 30, 2021, the Public Warrants were valued using the instrument\u2019s publicly listed trading price as of the\nbalance sheet date, which is considered to be a Level 1 measurement due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market.\nThe Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Modified Black Scholes Model which includes a Monte Carlo simulation, which is considered\nto be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is the\nexpected volatility of our common stock. The expected volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock was determined based on the implied volatility of the\nPublic Warrants.\nThe key inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation model for the Public Warrants and the Black-Scholes-Merton model for the Private Placement\nWarrants were as follows:\nFebruary 9, 2021\n(Initial Measurement)\nJune 30, 2021\nInput\nPublic\nWarrants\nPrivate\nWarrants\nPublic\nWarrants\nPrivate\nWarrants\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.74%\n0.74%\n0.91%\n0.91%\nExpected term (years)\n6.57\n6.57\n5.25\n5.25\nExpected volatility\n20%\n20%\n21.1%\n21.1%\nExercise price\n$\n11.50\n$\n11.50\n$\n11.50\n$\n11.50\nFair value of Units\n$\n9.68\n$\n9.68\n$\n9.89\n$\n9.89\nProbability of completing a business combination\n88.3%\n88.3%\n90.0%\n90.0%\nThe following table presents the changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities:\nPrivate\nPlacement\nPublic\nWarrant\nLiabilities\nFair value as of January 1, 2021\n$\n\u2014\n$\n\u2014\n$\n\u2014\nInitial measurement on February 9, 2021 (including over-allotment)\n7,891,333\n11,212,500\n19,103,833\nChange in valuation inputs or other assumptions\n178,000\n(86,250)\n91,750\nFair value as of March 31, 2021\n$\n8,069,333\n$\n11,126,250\n$\n19,195,583\nChange in valuation inputs or other assumptions\n830,667\n1,466,250\n2,296,917\nFair value as of June 30, 2021\n$\n8,900,000\n$\n12,592,500\n$\n21,492,500\nF-156\nTable of Contents\nALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2021\n(UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 10.

Total gain on disposal of property and equipment was $0 and $0 for the years ended\nDecember June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively\n3.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread\nthroughout the United States and rest of the world. This has adversely impacted global economic activity and contributed to significant declines\nand volatility in financial markets.\nOn March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) was enacted.\nThe CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package, which among other things contains numerous income tax\nprovisions applicable to U.S. income tax. Some of these tax provisions are expected to be effective retroactively for years ending before the date of\nenactment. The Company is currently evaluating the implications of the Act and its impact on the financial statements.\nIn response to the pandemic, on April 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $1,000,400 under the Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) which was established as part of the CARES Act and is administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA). The PPP\nprovides loans to qualifying businesses in amounts up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll expenses and was designed to provide a direct\nfinancial incentive for qualifying businesses to keep their workforce employed during the Coronavirus crisis. PPP loans are uncollateralized and\nguaranteed by the SBA and are forgivable after a \u201ccovered period\u201d (eight or twenty-four weeks) as long as the borrower maintains its payroll levels\nand uses the loan proceeds for eligible expenses, including payroll, benefits, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. The forgiveness amount will be\nreduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries and wages more than 25 percent during the covered period. Any unforgiven\nportion is payable over two years if issued before, or five years if issued after, June 5, 2020 at an interest rate of one percent with payments deferred\nuntil the SBA remits the borrower\u2019s loan forgiveness amount to the lender, or, if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness, ten months after the\nend of the covered period. PPP loan terms provide for customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and\nwarranties, and insolvency events and may be accelerated upon the occurrence of one or more of these events of default. Additionally, PPP loan\nterms do not include prepayment penalties.\nThe Company met the PPP\u2019s loan forgiveness requirements, and therefore, applied for forgiveness during November of 2020. On April 1, 2021, the\nCompany received legal release from the SBA, and therefore, presented the amount forgiven, $1,000,400, as forgiveness of paycheck program funds\nwithin the other income section in its 2021 statements of operations.\nThe SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP loan, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance\nwith the CARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in\nfull and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request.\nF-84\nTable of Contents\nhigi SH Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2021\n4.\nPromissory Notes\nPromissory Notes issued May 2020\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company and the lender of the Senior Note entered into a Note and Equity Interest Purchase and Redemption Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company paid $5,000,000 (Note Redemption Price) to the holder of the Senior Note.

The Administrator may grant Options or Share Appreciation Rights to Service Providers subject to the limitations in the Plan,\nincluding any limitations in the Plan that apply to ISOs. The Administrator will determine the number of Shares covered by each Option and Share\nAppreciation Right, the exercise price of each Option and Share Appreciation Right and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of each\nOption and Share Appreciation Right. Each Option will be designated in writing as an ISO or Non-Qualified Option at the time of grant\u037e provided,\nhowever, that if an Option is not so designated, then such Option will be a Non-Qualified Option, and the Shares purchased upon exercise of each type of\nOption will be separately accounted for. A Share Appreciation Right will entitle the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Share Appreciation\nRight) to receive from the Company upon exercise of the exercisable portion of the Share Appreciation Right an amount determined by multiplying the\nexcess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price per Share of the Share Appreciation Right by the\nnumber of Shares with respect to which the Share Appreciation Right is exercised, subject to any limitations of the Plan or that the Administrator may\nimpose and payable in cash, Shares valued at Fair Market Value or a combination of the two as the Administrator may determine or provide in the Award\nAgreement. A Participant will have no rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to any Option or Share Appreciation Right unless and until\nany Shares are issued in settlement of the Option or Share Appreciation Right.\n(b) Exercise Price. The Administrator will establish each Option\u2019s and Share Appreciation Right\u2019s exercise price and specify the exercise price in\nthe Award Agreement. Subject to Section 10(g), the exercise price will be no less than the nominal value of a Share and, in respect of Participants who are\nsubject to tax in the United States, shall also not be less than less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the grant date of the Option or Share\nAppreciation Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or Share Appreciation Right may be granted with an exercise price lower than 100% of the\nFair Market Value on the date of grant of such Award if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or share\nappreciation right pursuant to Section 4(e) and, in respect of Participants who are subject to tax in the United States, in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of Sections 409A and, if applicable, 424(a) of the Code.\n(c) Duration. Each Option or Share Appreciation Right will vest and be exercisable at such times and as specified in the Award Agreement,\nprovided that the term of an Option or Share Appreciation Right will not exceed ten years, subject to Section 10(g). Notwithstanding the foregoing and\nunless determined otherwise by the Company, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option or Share Appreciation Right (other than\nan ISO) (i) the exercise of the Option or Share Appreciation Right is prohibited by Applicable Laws, as determined by the Company, or (ii) Shares may not\nbe purchased or sold by the applicable Participant due to any Company insider trading, window period and/or dealing policy (including blackout\nperiods), the term of the Option or Share Appreciation Right shall be extended until the date that is thirty (30) days after the end of the legal prohibition,\nblack-out period, as determined by the Company\u037e provided, however, in no event shall the extension last beyond the original term of the applicable\nOption or Share Appreciation Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the end of the term of an Option or Share Appreciation\nRight, violates the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or other similar restrictive covenant provisions of any employment contract,\nconfidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the right of the\nParticipant and the Participant\u2019s transferees to exercise any Option or Share Appreciation Right issued to the Participant shall terminate immediately upon\nsuch violation, unless the Company otherwise determines. In addition, if, prior to the end of the term of an Option or Share Appreciation Right, the\nParticipant is given notice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries\nfor Cause, and the effective date of such Termination of Service is subsequent to the date of the delivery of such notice, the right of the Participant and\nthe Participant\u2019s transferees to exercise any Option or Share Appreciation Right issued to the Participant shall be suspended from the time of the delivery\nof such notice until the earlier of (i) such time as it is determined or otherwise agreed that the Participant\u2019s service as a Service Provider will not be\nterminated for Cause as provided in such notice or (ii) the effective date of the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service by the Company or\nC-5Table of Contents\nany of its Subsidiaries for Cause (in which case the right of the Participant and the Participant\u2019s transferees to exercise any Option or Share Appreciation\nRight issued to the Participant will terminate immediately upon the effective date of such Termination of Service)\u037e provided, however, in no event shall the\nsuspension cause the original term of the applicable Option or Share Appreciation Right to be extended.\n(d) Exercise. Options and Share Appreciation Rights may be exercised by delivering to the Company a written notice of exercise, in a form the\nAdministrator approves (which may be electronic), signed by the person authorized to exercise the Option or Share Appreciation Right, together with, as\napplicable, payment in full (i) as specified in Section 5(e) for the number of Shares for which the Award is exercised and (ii) as specified in Section 9(e) for\nany applicable taxes. Unless the Administrator otherwise determines, an Option or Share Appreciation Right may not be exercised for a fraction of a\nShare.\n(e) Payment Upon Exercise. Subject to any Company insider trading, window period and/or dealing policy (including blackout periods) and\nApplicable Laws, the exercise price of an Option must be paid by:\n(i) cash, wire transfer of immediately available funds or by check payable to the order of the Company, provided that the Company may limit\nthe use of one of the foregoing payment forms if one or more of the payment forms below is permitted\u037e\n(ii) if there is a public market for Shares at the time of exercise, unless the Administrator otherwise determines, (A) delivery (including\ntelephonically to the extent permitted by the Company) of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver\npromptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price, or (B) the Participant\u2019s delivery to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and\nunconditional instructions to a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price\u037e\nprovided that such amount is paid to the Company at such time as may be required by the Administrator\u037e\n(iii) to the extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of exercise, transfer of Shares owned by the Participant free and clear of any\nliens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, which, when valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date, have a value sufficient to pay the\nexercise price, provided that (1) at the time of exercise the Shares are publicly traded, (2) any remaining balance of the exercise price not satisfied by such\ntransfer is paid by the Participant in cash or other permitted form of payment, (3) such transfer would not violate any Applicable Laws or agreement\nrestricting the redemption of the Shares, (4) if required by the Administrator, any certificated Shares are endorsed or accompanied by an executed\nassignment separate from certificate, and (5) such Shares have been held by the Participant for any minimum period necessary to avoid adverse\naccounting treatment as a result of such delivery\u037e\n(iv) to the extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of exercise, except with respect to ISOs, surrendering the largest whole number\nof Shares then issuable upon the Option\u2019s exercise which, when valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date, have a value sufficient to pay the\nexercise price, provided that (1) such Shares used to pay the exercise price will not be exercisable thereafter and (2) any remaining balance of the exercise\nprice not satisfied by such net exercise is paid by the Participant in cash or other permitted form of payment\u037e\n(v) to the extent permitted by the Administrator at the time of exercise and permitted by Applicable Law, delivery of any other property that\nthe Administrator determines is good and valuable consideration\u037e or\n(vi) to the extent permitted by the Company, any combination of the above payment forms approved by the Administrator.\n(f) Non-Exempt U.S. Employees. No Option or Share Appreciation Right, whether or not vested, granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt\nemployee for purposes of the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as\nC-6\nTable of Contents\namended, will be first exercisable for any Shares until at least six months following the date of grant of such Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in\naccordance with the provisions of the U.S. Worker Economic Opportunity Act, any vested portion of such Award may be exercised earlier than six\nmonths following the date of grant of such Award in the event of (i) such Participant\u2019s death or Disability, (ii) a Corporate Event in which such Award is\nnot assumed, continued or substituted, (iii) a Change in Control, or (iv) such Participant\u2019s retirement (as such term may be defined in the Award\nAgreement or another applicable agreement or, in the absence of any such definition, in accordance with the Company\u2019s then current employment\npolicies and guidelines). This Section 5(f) is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or\nvesting of an Option or Share Appreciation Right will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay.\n6.",

In addition,\nif, prior to the vesting date of a Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit, the Participant is given notice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the\nParticipant\u2019s Termination of Service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause, and the effective date of such Termination of Service is\nsubsequent to the date of the delivery of such notice, the right of the Participant and the Participant\u2019s transferees to receive Shares as a result of the\nvesting of the Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit issued to the Participant shall be suspended from the time of the delivery of such notice until the\nearlier of (i) such time as it is determined or otherwise agreed that the Participant\u2019s service as a Service Provider will not be terminated for Cause as\nprovided in such notice or (ii) the effective date of the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Cause (in which\ncase the right of the Participant and the Participant\u2019s transferees to receive Shares on the vesting of the Restricted Share or Restricted Share Unit issued\nto the Participant will terminate immediately upon the effective date of such Termination of Service).\n(c) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any Restricted\nShares or Shares subject to Restricted Share Units, as determined (and on such terms as may be determined) by the Administrator and specified in the\nAward Agreement, subject to Applicable Laws.\nC-7Table of Contents\n(d) Restricted Shares.\n(i) Form of Award. The Company may require that the Participant deposit in escrow with the Company (or its designee) any certificates\nissued in respect of Restricted Shares, together with a stock transfer form endorsed in blank.

Restricted Shares may be granted in consideration for (A) cash or check, bank draft or money order payable to the\nCompany, (B) past services to the Company or a Subsidiary, or (C) any other form of consideration (including future services) as the Administrator may\ndetermine to be acceptable and which is permissible under Applicable Laws.\n(e) Restricted Share Units.\n(i) Settlement.

A Participant will have no rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to any Restricted Share Unit\nunless and until the Shares are delivered in settlement of the Restricted Share Unit.\n(iii) Consideration.

In addition, such payments under this provision may, in the Administrator\u2019s discretion,\nbe delayed to the same extent that payment of consideration to the holders of Shares in connection with the Corporate Event is delayed as a result of\nescrows, earn outs, holdbacks or any other contingencies\u037e\n(ii) To provide that such Award shall vest and, to the extent applicable, be exercisable as to all Shares covered thereby, notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in the Plan or the provisions of such Award as of a date prior to the effective time of such Corporate Event as the Administrator\ndetermines (or, if the Administrator does not determine such a date, as of the date that is five (5) days prior to the effective date of the Corporate Event),\nwith such Award terminating if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Corporate Event\u037e provided, however, that the\nAdministrator may require Participants to complete and deliver to the Company a notice of exercise before the effective date of a Corporate Event, which\nexercise is contingent upon the effectiveness of such Corporate Event\u037e\n(iii) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or surviving entity, or a parent or Subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted\nfor by awards covering the equity securities of the successor or surviving entity, or a parent or Subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the\nnumber and kind of shares and/or applicable exercise or purchase price, in all cases, as determined by the Administrator\u037e\n(iv) To arrange for the assignment of any forfeiture, reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Shares issued\npursuant to the Award to the surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving or acquiring corporation\u2019s parent entity)\u037e\n(v) To arrange for the lapse, in whole or in part, of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to the Award\u037e\n(vi) To replace such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator\u037e\n(vii) To provide that the Award will terminate, with or without consideration, and cannot vest, be exercised or become payable after the\napplicable transaction or event\u037e and/or\n(viii) To provide that any Shares subject to an Award shall be converted to deferred shares and redeemed under the terms of the Company\u2019s\narticles of association, or to require such Shares to be transferred to an employee benefit trust.\nThe Administrator need not take the same action or actions with respect to all Awards or portions thereof or with respect to all Participants.

        "Section Text": "9.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS\n(a) Transferability. Except as the Administrator may determine or provide in an Award Agreement or otherwise for Awards, Awards may not be\nsold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and\ndistribution, and, during the life of the Participant, will be exercisable only by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may, in its\nsole discretion, permit transfer of an Award pursuant to a domestic relations order or in such other manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and\nsecurities laws upon the Participant\u2019s request and provided that the Participant and the transferee enter into a transfer agreement and other agreements as\nrequired by the Company. If an Option is an ISO, such Option may be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Option as a result of a transfer pursuant to this\nSection. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in this context, will include references to a Participant\u2019s authorized transferee that the\nAdministrator specifically approves.\n(b) Documentation. Each Award will be evidenced in an Award Agreement, which may be written or electronic, as the Administrator determines. By\naccepting any Award the Participant consents to receive documents by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through any on-line electronic\nsystem established and maintained by the Company or another third party selected by the Company. Each Award may contain terms and conditions in\naddition to (or a variation of or effecting a disapplication of) those set forth in the Plan. Any reference herein or in an Award Agreement to a \u201cwritten\u201d\nagreement or document will include any agreement or document delivered electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto)\nor posted on the Company\u2019s intranet (or other shared electronic medium controlled by the Company to which the Participant has access). As a condition\nto accepting an Award under the Plan, the Participant agrees to execute any additional documents or instruments necessary or desirable, as determined in\nthe Administrator\u2019s sole discretion, to carry out the purposes or intent of the Award, or facilitate compliance with securities and/or other regulatory\nrequirements, in each case at the Administrator\u2019s request.\n(c) Discretion. Except as the Plan otherwise provides, each Award may be made alone or in addition or in relation to any other Award. The terms of\neach Award to a Participant need not be identical, and the Administrator need not treat Participants or Awards (or portions thereof) uniformly.\n(d) Termination of Status. The Administrator will determine how the disability, death, retirement, authorized leave of absence or any other change\nor purported change in a Participant\u2019s Service Provider status (including a change which would result in a Termination of Service under the Plan but not\nunder the Non-Employee Sub-Plan or vice versa) affects an Award and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant, the Participant\u2019s\nlegal representative, conservator, guardian or Designated Beneficiary may exercise rights under the Award, if applicable.\n(e) Withholding. Each Participant must pay the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Administrator for payment of, any taxes (which\nincludes any social security contributions or the like including\nC-10Table of Contents\nbut not limited to, if applicable, all liability to primary (employee) and secondary (employer) national insurance contributions) required by law to be\nwithheld or paid by the Company or by any Subsidiary that is the employing entity of the Participant or which Participant has agreed to pay in\nconnection with such Participant\u2019s Awards by the date of the event creating the tax liability. A Participant may not be able to exercise an Award even\nthough the Award is vested, and the Company shall have no obligation to issue Shares subject to an Award, unless and until such obligations are\nsatisfied. The Company may deduct an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations based on the maximum statutory withholding rates (or such other\nrate as may be determined by the Company after considering any accounting consequences or costs and Applicable Law) from any payment of any kind\notherwise due to a Participant. To the extent permitted by the terms of an Award Agreement and subject to any Company insider trading, window period\nand/or dealing policy (including blackout periods), Participants may satisfy such tax obligations (i) in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available\nfunds, by check made payable to the order of the Company, provided that the Company may limit the use of the foregoing payment forms if one or more\nof the payment forms below is permitted, (ii) to the extent permitted by the Administrator, in whole or in part by delivery of Shares, including Shares\nretained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value, (iii) if there is a public market for Shares at the time the tax\nobligations are satisfied, unless the Administrator otherwise determines, (A) delivery (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company)\nof an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to satisfy\nthe tax obligations, or (B) delivery by the Participant to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a broker acceptable to the\nCompany to deliver promptly to the Company cash or a check sufficient to satisfy the tax and/or social security withholding, provided that such amount\nis paid to the Company at such time as may be required by the Administrator, (iv) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash, (v) withholding\npayment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant or (vi) to the extent permitted by the Company, any combination of the foregoing\npayment forms approved by the Administrator.\n(f) Withholding Indemnification. As a condition to accepting an Award under the Plan, in the event that the amount of the Company\u2019s and/or any\nSubsidiary\u2019s withholding obligation in connection with such Award was greater than the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or its\nSubsidiaries, each Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and/or its Subsidiaries harmless from any failure by the Company and/or its\nSubsidiaries to withhold the proper amount.\n(g) Amendment of Award\u037e Repricing. The Administrator may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including by cancelling and\nsubstituting another Award of the same or a different type, reducing the exercise price, changing the exercise or settlement date, converting an ISO to a\nNon-Qualified Option, taking any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles or by amending, waiving or\nrelaxing any applicable performance criteria or goal(s). The Participant\u2019s consent to such action will be required unless (i) the action, taking into account\nany related action, does not Materially Impair the Participant\u2019s rights under the Award, or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 8 or pursuant to\nSection 10(f).\n(h) Conditions on Issuance of Shares. The Company will not be obligated to issue any Shares under the Plan or remove restrictions from Shares\npreviously issued under the Plan until (i) all Award conditions have been met or removed to the Company\u2019s satisfaction, (ii) as determined by the\nCompany, all other legal matters regarding the issuance of such Shares (including payment of nominal value) have been satisfied, including any\napplicable securities laws and stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company\nsuch representations or agreements as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to satisfy any Applicable Laws. The Company\u2019s inability to\nobtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which the Administrator determines is necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any\nsecurities, will relieve the Company of any liability for failing to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained.\n(i) Acceleration. The Administrator may at any time provide that any Award will become immediately vested and fully or partially exercisable, free\nof some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise fully or partially realizable.\nC-11\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "10.\nMISCELLANEOUS\n(a) No Right to Employment or Other Status. No person will have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award will not be\nconstrued as giving a Participant the right to continued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the\nright at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with a Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan or any Award, except as\nexpressly provided in an Award Agreement. Further, nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in\nconnection with any Award will constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or a Subsidiary regarding the fact or nature of future positions,\nfuture work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or service or confer any right or benefit under the Award or\nthe Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of the Award Agreement and/or Plan.\n(b) No Rights as Shareholder\u037e Certificates. Subject to the Award Agreement, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary will have any rights as a\nshareholder with respect to any Shares to be distributed under an Award until becoming the record holder of such Shares on the register of members of\nthe Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless the Administrator otherwise determines or Applicable Laws require, the Company\nwill not be required to deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with any Award and instead such Shares may be\nrecorded in the register of members of the Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator). The Company may place legends on\ncertificates issued under the Plan that the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to comply with Applicable Laws.\n(c) Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan will come into existence on the day it is adopted by the Board but no Awards may be granted under\nthe Plan prior to the Effective Date. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan will remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date,\nbut Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date in accordance with the Plan. No ISOs may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the\nearlier of (i) the date the Plan is adopted by the Board, or (ii) the date the Plan is approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders. If the Plan is not approved by\nthe Company\u2019s shareholders within 12 months of the date of Board approval of the Plan, all ISOs will be treated as Non-Qualified Options.\n(d) Amendment and Termination of Plan. The Administrator may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time\u037e provided that no amendment,\nsuspension or termination may Materially Impair any Award outstanding at the time of such amendment without the affected Participant\u2019s written\nconsent. No Awards may be granted under the Plan during any suspension period or after Plan termination. Awards outstanding at the time of any Plan\nsuspension or termination will continue to be governed by the Plan and the Award Agreement, as in effect before such suspension or termination. The\nBoard will obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws.\n(e) Provisions for Foreign Participants. The Administrator may modify Awards granted to Participants who are nationals of, or employed in, a\njurisdiction outside the United Kingdom and the United States or establish subplans or procedures under the Plan to address differences in laws, rules,\nregulations or customs of such international jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters, including as may be\nnecessary or appropriate in the Administrator\u2019s discretion to grant Awards under any tax-favourable regime that may be available in any jurisdiction\n(provided that Administrator approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the Plan or any Award Agreement to ensure or facilitate\ncompliance with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction).\n(f) Section 409A. The following provisions only apply to Participants subject to tax in the United States:\n(i) General. The Company intends that all Awards be structured to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A, such that no adverse tax\nconsequences, interest, or penalties under Section 409A apply.\nC-12Table of Contents\nNotwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator may, without a Participant\u2019s consent, amend this Plan\nor Awards, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions (including amendments, policies, procedures and retroactive actions) as are\nnecessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of Awards, including any such actions intended to (A) exempt this Plan or any Award\nfrom Section 409A, or (B) comply with Section 409A, including regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority that may be\nissued after an Award\u2019s grant date. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to an Award\u2019s tax treatment under Section 409A or otherwise.\nThe Company will have no obligation under this Section 10(f) or otherwise to avoid the taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A with respect to any\nAward and will have no liability to any Participant or any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to\nconstitute noncompliant \u201cnonqualified deferred compensation\u201d subject to taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A.\n(ii) Separation from Service. If an Award constitutes \u201cnonqualified deferred compensation\u201d under Section 409A, any payment or\nsettlement of such Award upon a termination of a Participant\u2019s Service Provider relationship will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section\n409A, be made only upon the Participant\u2019s \u201cseparation from service\u201d (within the meaning of Section 409A), whether such \u201cseparation from service\u201d\noccurs upon or after the termination of the Participant\u2019s Service Provider relationship. For purposes of this Plan or any Award Agreement relating to any\nsuch payments or benefits, references to a \u201ctermination,\u201d \u201ctermination of service\u201d, \u201ctermination of employment\u201d or like terms means a \u201cseparation from\nservice.\u201d\n(iii) Payments to Specified Employees. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or any Award Agreement, any payment(s) of\n\u201cnonqualified deferred compensation\u201d required to be made under an Award to a \u201cspecified employee\u201d (as defined under Section 409A and as the\nAdministrator determines) due to his or her \u201cseparation from service\u201d will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the\nCode, be delayed for the six-month period immediately following such \u201cseparation from service\u201d (or, if earlier, until the specified employee\u2019s death) and\nwill instead be paid (as set forth in the Award Agreement) on the day immediately following such six-month period or as soon as administratively\npracticable thereafter (without interest). Any payments of \u201cnonqualified deferred compensation\u201d under such Award payable more than six months\nfollowing the Participant\u2019s \u201cseparation from service\u201d will be paid at the time or times the payments are otherwise scheduled to be made.\n(g) 10% Shareholders. The Administrator may grant ISOs only to employees of the Company, any of its present or future parent or subsidiary\ncorporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, respectively, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to receive ISOs\nunder the Code. If an ISO is granted to a Greater Than 10% Shareholder, the exercise price will not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value on the\nOption\u2019s grant date, and the term of the Option will not exceed five years. All ISOs will be subject to and construed consistently with Section 422 of the\nCode. By accepting an ISO, the Participant agrees to give prompt notice to the Company of dispositions or other transfers (other than in connection with\na Change in Control) of Shares acquired under the Option made within (i) two years from the grant date of the Option or (ii) one year after the transfer of\nsuch Shares to the Participant, specifying the date of the disposition or other transfer and the amount the Participant realized, in cash, other property,\nassumption of indebtedness or other consideration, in such disposition or other transfer. Neither the Company nor the Administrator will be liable to a\nParticipant, or any other party, if an ISO fails or ceases to qualify as an \u201cincentive stock option\u201d under Section 422 of the Code. Any ISO or portion\nthereof that fails to qualify as an \u201cincentive stock option\u201d under Section 422 of the Code for any reason, including becoming exercisable with respect to\nShares having a fair market value exceeding the $100,000 limitation under Treasury Regulation Section 1.422-4, will be a Non-Qualified Option.\n(h) Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no individual acting as a director, officer, other employee or agent of\nthe Company or any Subsidiary will be liable to any Participant, former Participant, spouse, beneficiary, or any other person for any claim, loss, liability, or\nexpense incurred in connection with the Plan or any Award, and such individual will not be personally liable with respect to the Plan because of any\ncontract or other instrument executed in his or her capacity as an Administrator, director, officer,\nC-13\nTable of Contents\nother employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary. As a condition to accepting an Award under the Plan, each Participant (i) agrees to not make\nany claim against the Company, the Group or any of its officers, Directors, Employees or Subsidiaries related to tax or social security liabilities arising from\nsuch Award or other Company or Group compensation and (ii) acknowledges that such Participant was advised to consult with his or her own personal\ntax, financial and other legal advisors regarding the tax and social security consequences of the Award and has either done so or knowingly and\nvoluntarily declined to do so. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each director, officer, other employee and agent of the Company or any\nSubsidiary that has been or will be granted or delegated any duty or power relating to the Plan\u2019s administration or interpretation, against any cost or\nexpense (including attorneys\u2019 fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the Administrator\u2019s approval) arising from any act or\nomission concerning this Plan unless arising from such person\u2019s own fraud or bad faith.\n(i) No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. Except as required by Applicable Laws the Company has no duty or obligation to any Participant to\nadvise such Participant as to the time or manner of exercising such Award. Furthermore, the Company has no duty or obligation to warn or otherwise\nadvise such Participant of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. The Company\nhas no duty or obligation to minimize the tax or social security consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award and will not be liable to any holder\nof an Award for any adverse tax or social security consequences to such holder in connection with an Award.\n(j) Data Privacy.\n(i) As a condition for receiving any Award, each Participant acknowledges that the Company and any Subsidiary may collect, use and\ntransfer, in electronic or other form, personal data as described in this section by and among the Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates exclusively\nfor implementing, administering and managing the Participant\u2019s participation in the Plan. The Company (as above) may hold certain personal information\nabout a Participant, including the Participant\u2019s name, address and telephone number\u037e birthdate\u037e social security, insurance number or other identification\nnumber\u037e salary\u037e nationality\u037e job title(s)\u037e any Shares held in the Company (as above)\u037e and Award details, to implement, manage and administer the Plan and\nAwards (the \u201cData\u201d). The Company (as above) may transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary to implement, administer and manage a\nParticipant\u2019s participation in the Plan, and the Company (as above) may transfer the Data to third parties assisting the Company with Plan implementation,\nadministration and management. These recipients may be located in the Participant\u2019s country, or elsewhere, and the Participant\u2019s country may have\ndifferent data privacy laws and protections than the recipients\u2019 country.
