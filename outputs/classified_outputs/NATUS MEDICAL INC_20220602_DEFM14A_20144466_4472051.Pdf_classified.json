Sullivan,\nfollowing the Closing, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent required Mr. Sullivan to enter\ninto a retention agreement, dated as of April 17, 2022, with Parent and the Company (the \u201cCEO Retention\nAgreement\u201d).\nPursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that, notwithstanding the treatment of Company\nRestricted Stock Units set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described above), he would not receive payment in\nrespect of his Company Restricted Stock Units that are market stock units (\u201cMSUs\u201d) based on deemed achievement\nof performance goals at maximum levels. Instead, Mr. Sullivan\u2019s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of\nperformance actually achieved through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of\ntarget, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs\ngranted to Mr. Sullivan in January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company\u2019s stockholders pursuant\nto the Merger Agreement. The consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of\ngross proceeds that he otherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the\n\u201cRetention Payment\u201d) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units would\nnot become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on the six-month anniversary of\nthe Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued employment with the\nCompany until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company without cause,\nby Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid portion of the Retention Payment\nwill be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a termination by the Company without cause or by\nMr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims). If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment\nterminates for any other reason prior to the relevant retention date, he will immediately forfeit all portions of the\nRetention Payment that relate to a future retention date. Mr. Sullivan\u2019s right to receive the Retention Payment is\nfurther subject to his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants. At the Effective Time, all other\namounts payable to Mr. Sullivan in respect of his Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units will\nbecome payable in accordance with the Merger Agreement, as described above.\nThe CEO Retention Agreement was signed at the same time the Merger Agreement was signed, but if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated and the Closing does not occur, it will automatically become null and void.\n3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other\nnominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal. Abstentions will not\nhave any effect on the adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become\npayable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nApproval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to\nits named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nvotes cast affirmatively or negatively at the Company Stockholder Meeting.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (2) grant a proxy over the internet or\nby telephone\u037e or (3) vote virtually by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting will not, assuming a quorum is\npresent, have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, of certain compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you\nhold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your\nshares will not, assuming a quorum is present, have any effect on the compensation proposal. Abstentions will\nnot, assuming a quorum is present, have any effect on the compensation proposal.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nSEC rules require Natus to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may\nbecome payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?\nA:\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with\nthe Merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of Natus\u2019\nnamed executive officers. For further detail, please see the section in this proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal\n3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve Certain Merger Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to\nits named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Company Stockholder Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the\ncompensation that will or may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the\nMerger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Natus or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is adopted by\nthe stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Natus to\nits named executive officers in connection with the Merger may be paid to Natus\u2019 named executive officers even\nif stockholders do not adopt the payment of that compensation.

In this\ncase, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Natus.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee as of the record date, you are considered the\n\u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of Company Common Stock held in \u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy\nstatement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to\nthose shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank,\nbroker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited\nto attend the Company Stockholder Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may\nnot vote your shares in person (virtually) at the Company Stockholder Meeting unless you obtain a \u201clegal\nproxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes\nwith shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. For voting purposes, any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different\nstockholder than any shares you hold of record, and as a result, any shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d will not be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares that you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various\nregistered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will\nreceive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for the shares held in each such form, because\nthey are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of Company Common Stock held by a corporation\nor business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Company Common Stock are registered in your name\nwith Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting virtually by ballot.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your\nshares of Company Common Stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded\nwhen voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge\nfor voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as\ninternet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.\nEven if you plan to attend the Company Stockholder Meeting in person (virtually), you are strongly encouraged\nto vote your shares of Company Common Stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a \u201clegal\nproxy\u201d to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Company Common Stock\nvirtually by ballot at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are\npresent at the Company Stockholder Meeting and vote virtually by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not\nbe counted.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your\nbank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the\ninternet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee,\nyou should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me without receiving voting\ninstructions from me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nscheduled to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other\nnominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote\nyour shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same\neffect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to\nadjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, as determined in good\nfaith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the\nMerger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, or, assuming a quorum is present, the\nproposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable by\nNatus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is\nvoted at the Company Stockholder Meeting by:\n\u2022\nsigning another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us in accordance with the instructions\ntherein prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier\nsubmitted proxy but prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary\u037e or\n\u2022\nattending the Company Stockholder Meeting and voting virtually by ballot.\nIf you hold your shares of Company Common Stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or\nother nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.

The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Company\nStockholder Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares\nof Company Common Stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d Thomas J. Sullivan is the proxy holder for the Company\nStockholder Meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you\nindicate. When completing the internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your\nshares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of\nbusiness to come before the Company Stockholder Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting from time to time, if\nnecessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, including to solicit additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Company Stockholder\nMeeting\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will\nor may become payable by Natus to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy\ncard and voting instruction card that you receive.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one\nbrokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you\nhold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will\nreceive more than one proxy card.\n21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Company Stockholder Meeting?\nA:\nNatus will publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the\nCompany Stockholder Meeting. All reports that Natus files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. Please\nsee the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to\nthe Merger?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d), the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the\nMerger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S.\nHolder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares of Company Common Stock surrendered in the Merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income\nTax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the\nexchange of Company Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain\nconnections to the United States.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor to determine the\nU.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and\nany consequences arising under U.S. Federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax\njurisdiction. A more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is\nprovided in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nthe Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will the holders of Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options\nreceive in the Merger?\nA:\nAt the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Employee Interim Awards, each share of\nCompany Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or\nunvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be cancelled and converted into\nand will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax\nwithholding, equal to the Per Share Price.\nAt the Effective Time, except as set forth below with respect to Employee Interim Awards or as set forth in the\nCEO Retention Agreement, each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the\nEffective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan,\nwill be cancelled and be converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest\nand subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price\u037e multiplied by (ii) (1)\nwith respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-vesting requirements, the total\nnumber of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit, and (2) with\nrespect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements, the\ntotal number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the performance\ngoals deemed achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied.\nAt the Effective Time, any Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units that are Employee\nInterim Awards and are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested\nand whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be treated at the Effective Time in the\nmanner set forth above, provided that any applicable performance goals will be deemed achieved at target levels\n(rather than at maximum) and the number of shares subject to such Employee Interim Awards that will vest at the\nEffective Time will be prorated to reflect the portion of the applicable vesting period that has elapsed from the\ndate of grant until the Effective Time (rather than vesting in full), and the remaining unvested portion of any\nEmployee Interim Awards will be forfeited at the Effective Time.\nAt the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,\nwhether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, and is an\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an\namount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per\nShare Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total\nnumber of shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option.\nAt the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled\nwithout any cash payment being made in respect thereof.\nPursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that he will not receive payment in respect of his\nCompany Restricted Stock Units that are MSUs based on deemed achievement of performance goals at\nmaximum levels and, instead Mr. Sullivan\u2019s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of performance actually\nachieved through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of target, in the case\nof MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr.\nSullivan in January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement. The consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of\ngross proceeds that he otherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000\n(the \u201cRetention Payment\u201d) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units\nwould not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on the six-month\nanniversary of the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued\nemployment with the Company until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment is terminated by\nthe Company without cause, by Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid\nportion of the Retention Payment shall be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a\ntermination by the Company without cause or by Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-\nrevocation of a release of claims). If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment terminates for any other reason prior to the\nrelevant retention date, he will immediately forfeit all portions of the Retention Payment that relate to a future\nretention date. Mr. Sullivan\u2019s right to receive the Retention Payment is further subject to his continued\ncompliance with certain restrictive covenants.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?\nA:\nThere are no outstanding purchase rights under the Company\u2019s 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be\npredicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Merger,\u201d many of which are outside of our\ncontrol.\nQ:\nIf the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?\nA:\nIf the Merger is completed and your shares of Company Common Stock are held as uncertificated shares, the\npayment agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action\non your part.

This means that holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled\nto have their shares of Company Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive\npayment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount\ndetermined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any\nvoluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the\nDGCL). Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock are encouraged to\nseek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the\nappraisal process.

As a result of the Merger, Company Common Stock will no longer be publicly\ntraded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. At this time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises\nof Natus, and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation\u037e and all debts, liabilities and duties of Natus and\nMerger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. In addition, all outstanding\nshares of Company Common Stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic\nreports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock or any other rights\nor interest in the Surviving Corporation.\nThe Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware or at such later time as would be specified in the Certificate of Merger.\nEffect on Natus if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,\nCompany Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares (or interests in shares) of Company Common\nStock. Instead, Natus will remain an independent public company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed\nand traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the\nSEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner\nsimilar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks\nand opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in\nwhich Natus operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not completed, we cannot assure you as to the effect of these risks and opportunities\non the future value of your shares of Company Common Stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors\nof Natus (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) will continue to evaluate and review Natus\u2019 business operations, strategic\ndirection and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the\nMerger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can\nbe no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors will be offered or that Natus\u2019\nbusiness, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Natus will be required to pay\nParent a termination fee. If the termination fee becomes payable by Natus due to (x) Natus\u2019 termination of the Merger\nAgreement on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 22, 2022 (the \u201cCut-Off Date\u201d) with respect to Natus\nentering into an alternative acquisition agreement with an Excluded Party (as such term is defined in the Merger\nAgreement), the amount of the termination fee will be $19,753,676, and (y) if the termination fee becomes payable\nunder any other circumstance, the amount of the termination fee will be $39,507,352.

        "Section Header": "Background of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThis chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Board of Directors, Natus\u2019\nrepresentatives or other parties.\nAs part of the ongoing consideration and evaluation of Natus\u2019 long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of\nDirectors and Natus\u2019 senior management periodically review, consider and assess Natus\u2019 operations and financial\nperformance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect those strategic goals and plans. This review\nincludes, among other items, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions\nand other financial and strategic alternatives.\nIn early January 2021, a private equity sponsor (\u201cFinancial Sponsor A\u201d) submitted a proposal to acquire the\nCompany for a per share price of $28 to $30 in cash. In mid-January 2021, the Board of Directors met and discussed\nand considered this proposal, and also in attendance were members of management and outside counsel. Outside\ncounsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. In light of that conversation,\nthe Board of Directors determined to retain a financial advisor. Shortly after that meeting, the Board of Directors met\nagain to interview two financial advisors, one of whom was Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (\u201cStifel\u201d). After\nevaluating both financial advisors, and discussing each financial advisor\u2019s qualifications, credentials and\nindependence in connection with serving as the Company\u2019s financial adviser, the Board of Directors retained Stifel to\nbe the Company\u2019s financial advisor, based on Stifel\u2019s expertise and experience in similar transactions and absence of\nconflicts. At a subsequent meeting, the Board of Directors met again, with representatives of Stifel and outside\ncounsel in attendance. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware\nlaw. Based on instruction by the Board of Directors, Stifel encouraged Financial Sponsor A to improve the terms of its\nproposal before due diligence access would be granted by the Company.\nIn early February 2021, Financial Sponsor A subsequently increased its proposal for a business combination with the\nCompany to a per share price of $35 to $37 in cash. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law. The Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of\nmanagement and outside counsel. The Board of Directors discussed and considered this improved proposal, and in\nmid-February 2021, at the direction of the Board of Directors, the Company and Financial Sponsor A entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement (which contained a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision that, among other things, would automatically\nterminate if the Company were to enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or\nconsolidated assets), and the Company provided due diligence access to Financial Sponsor A.\n37TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn early March 2021, while Financial Sponsor A was continuing its due diligence on the Company, outside counsel to\nFinancial Sponsor A provided a draft merger agreement to the Company and its outside counsel. Thereafter, during\nMarch 2021, outside counsel for Financial Sponsor A and outside counsel for the Company discussed and\nnegotiated the terms of the merger agreement.\nIn late March 2021, Financial Sponsor A informed Stifel that it no longer was willing to pay a price per share of $35 to\n$37 in cash. Shortly thereafter, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of management and\nrepresentatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors discussed this development, and determined to contact\nother potential financial and strategic parties who might have interest in the Company. The Board of Directors noted\nthat contacting other parties had the risk of creating opportunities for public speculation that the Company was\npursuing a sale, and that such speculation could be harmful to the Company and its employees and business\npartners. In light of these considerations, the Board of Directors determined that the risks of broadly contacting too\nmany additional potential acquirers outweighed the benefits, and instead determined to instruct Stifel to contact a\nmore tailored set of other potential parties. In late March 2021, pursuant to instructions from the Board of Directors,\nStifel contacted two strategic parties and one financial sponsor, who the Board of Directors, in consultation with\nStifel, believed would have synergies in connection with an acquisition of the Company. The two strategic parties\ndeclined to enter into confidentiality agreements. The one financial sponsor did sign a confidentiality agreement with\nthe Company (which contained a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the\nCompany were to enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets)\nand conducted limited due diligence but declined to proceed further.\nAt the end of March 2021, Financial Sponsor A communicated to Stifel that they would be willing to proceed at a\nprice per share of $31. Shortly thereafter, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of\nmanagement and representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of\nDirectors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, after which the Board of Directors discussed this development\nand reviewed this revised proposal from Financial Sponsor A. The Board of Directors declined to make a definitive\ndecision on the revised proposal by Financial Sponsor A at that time. The Board of Directors determined to contact\nadditional other potential financial and strategic parties who might have interest in the Company. The Board of\nDirectors again discussed and weighed the benefits of a targeted approach versus a broad approach to contacting\nother parties noted above. In light of these considerations, the Board of Directors again determined that the risks of\nbroadly contacting too many additional potential acquirers outweighed the benefits, and instead determined to\ninstruct Stifel to contact a more tailored set of other potential parties.\nIn early April 2021, pursuant to instructions from the Board of Directors, Stifel contacted an additional strategic party\nand three financial sponsors. The strategic party declined to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company,\nbut each of the three financial sponsors entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company (each of which\ncontained a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to\nenter into a definitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets). Two of the three\nfinancial sponsors proceeded with due diligence but declined to proceed further. The third declined to proceed with\ndue diligence.\nThe Board of Directors met again in early to mid-April 2021, and also in attendance were members of management and\nrepresentatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors further discussed the revised proposal of $31 per share in\ncash from Financial Sponsor A. The Board of Directors authorized Thomas Sullivan, then the senior independent\ndirector, to speak with Financial Sponsor A to encourage it to improve its proposal. In mid to late April 2021, Mr.\nSullivan spoke with a representative at Financial Sponsor A, and Financial Sponsor A thereafter signaled a\nwillingness to improve its proposal, offering to acquire the Company for a per share price of $31.50 in cash. However,\nin early May 2021, Financial Sponsor A notified the Company that it was no longer willing to proceed with a\ntransaction with the Company.\nIn mid-2021, the Company and ArchiMed SAS (\u201cArchiMed\u201d) had discussions concerning the Company\u2019s interest in\nacquiring a portfolio company of ArchiMed (the \u201cPortfolio Company\u201d). These discussions were preliminary and high\nlevel. The Company received information on the Portfolio Company and conducted preliminary due diligence, but the\nCompany did not provide any information of the Company to ArchiMed.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn August 2021, the Company\u2019s management met with a strategic party (\u201cStrategic Party A\u201d) as part of the normal\ncourse of business. During this meeting, Strategic Party A expressed interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with\nthe Company. In mid-August 2021, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of management\nand representatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors discussed this interest from Strategic Party A, and\nauthorized management to cause the Company to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party A. The\nBoard of Directors also determined to contact other financial sponsors and strategic parties to assess their interest in\na business combination transaction with the Company. The Board of Directors again discussed and weighed the\nbenefits of a targeted approach versus a broad approach to contacting other parties noted above. In light of these\nconsiderations, the Board of Directors again determined that the risks of broadly contacting too many additional\npotential acquirers outweighed the benefits, and instead determined to instruct Stifel to contact a more tailored set of\nother potential parties.\nIn late August 2021, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party A (which contained a\n\u201cstandstill\u201d provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets). Subsequent to entering into\nthe confidentiality agreement, the Company\u2019s management met with Strategic Party A\u2019s management to provide due\ndiligence information.\nIn September 2021, Stifel, at the instruction of the Board of Directors, contacted two additional financial sponsors and\none strategic party to assess their interest in a business combination transaction with the Company. Each of these\nparties signed a confidentiality agreement with the Company (which contained a \u201cstandstill\u201d provision that, among\nother things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to enter into a definitive agreement to sell more than\n50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets). All three parties were then given access to due diligence information.\nThe two financial sponsors declined to proceed further. The strategic party indicated interest in certain segments of\nthe Company but not the entire Company, but such a transaction would not, in the view of the Board of Directors,\nhave been viewed favorably by the Company Stockholders. The strategic party did not indicate a definitive price it\nwould be willing to pay for the segments in which it was interested.\nDuring the month of September 2021, Strategic Party A continued its due diligence investigation of the Company. In\nlate September 2021, Strategic Party A submitted a proposal to acquire the Company for $28 per share in cash.\nIn early October 2021, the Board of Directors met, and also in attendance were members of management and\nrepresentatives from Stifel and outside counsel. After outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their\nfiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors discussed the proposal from Strategic Party A. The Board\nof Directors authorized the chairman of the Board of Directors and the senior independent director, and Stifel, to\nencourage Strategic Party A to improve the terms of its proposal. The Board of Directors also discussed that\nStrategic Party A may make a request of exclusivity, and that such a request would be acceptable if Strategic Party A\nimproved its proposal. In early October 2021, after the chairman of the Board of Directors, the senior independent\ndirector and Stifel met with Strategic Party A, Strategic Party A submitted an improved proposal, which it stated was\nits best and final offer, to acquire the Company for $32 per share in cash, conditioned upon a short period of\nexclusivity. Thereafter, the Company and Strategic Party A signed an exclusivity agreement providing for a short\nperiod of exclusivity. The Company\u2019s outside counsel then sent a draft merger agreement to Strategic Party A\u2019s\noutside counsel, and the parties negotiated that merger agreement, and Strategic Party A continued its due diligence,\nduring the remainder of October 2021 and early November 2021. In early November 2021, Strategic Party A declined to\nproceed with the transaction.\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company announced the transition of its chief executive officer from Jonathan Kennedy\nto Thomas J. Sullivan, as further described in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with\nthe SEC on December 17, 2021.\nOn December 21, 2021, Mr. Denis Ribon from ArchiMed SAS contacted Mr. Sullivan to see if Mr. Sullivan would be\ninterested in meeting.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 5, 2022, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Ribon, along with two colleagues, met by video conference to discuss their\ntwo companies. Only public information was discussed at this meeting. The parties agreed to a face to face meeting\non January 19, 2022. Mr. Sullivan informed the Chairman of the Board of Directors of this planned meeting on January\n7, 2022.\nOn January 18, ArchiMed sent a presentation, which contained solely public information, about ArchiMed to Mr.\nSullivan.\nOn January 19, 2022, Mr. Sullivan met with representatives of ArchiMed to discuss their companies. Mr. Sullivan only\ndisclosed publicly available financial information about the Company at this meeting. Two days later, on January 21,\n2022, Mr. Sullivan held a video call with representatives of ArchiMed to discuss the Company\u2019s interest in the\nPortfolio Company. Again, Mr. Sullivan only disclosed publicly available financial information about the Company at\nthis meeting.\nOn January 25, 2022, ArchiMed\u2019s representative, Mr. Bateman, and Mr. Sullivan discussed the Company\u2019s interest in\nthe Portfolio Company. An additional meeting was held on January 28, 2022 for the same purpose.\nOn February 1, 2022 Mr. Sullivan informed the Board of Directors of meetings he had had with external parties in the\nnormal course of the Board meeting. Mr. Sullivan noted that he suspected ArchiMed had an interest in acquiring the\nCompany.\nOn February 4, 2022, Mr. Bateman informed Mr. Sullivan that ArchiMed was considering submitting a proposal for a\nbusiness combination with the Company. Mr. Sullivan said he would promptly bring any offer to the Board of\nDirectors. On February 7, 2022, Mr. Sullivan informed the Chairman of the Board of Directors that ArchiMed may be\nsubmitting a proposal for a business combination with the Company.\nOn February 9, 2022, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Bateman discussed the Company\u2019s interests in the Portfolio Company.\nOn February 16, 2022, ArchiMed submitted a written proposal to Mr. Sullivan to acquire the Company for $32 per\nshare in cash (the \u201cInitial ArchiMed Proposal\u201d). Mr. Sullivan promptly forwarded the proposal to the Board of\nDirectors.\nThe Board of Directors met on February 20, 2022, to discuss the Initial ArchiMed Proposal, and also in attendance\nwas outside counsel. Outside counsel reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law.\nThe Board of Directors reviewed the financials for the five year strategic plan presented by management. The Board\nof Directors determined to direct Stifel to engage with ArchiMed and to encourage ArchiMed to improve the terms of\nthe Initial ArchiMed Proposal. The Board of Directors also authorized the Company to enter into a confidentiality\nagreement with ArchiMed, if management determined such action would be helpful in encouraging ArchiMed to\nimprove the terms of its proposal.\nOn February 21, 2022, representatives of Stifel spoke with representatives of ArchiMed. Stifel encouraged ArchiMed\nto improve the terms of the Initial ArchiMed Proposal.\nOn February 23, 2022, Jefferies LLC, financial advisor to ArchiMed (\u201cJefferies\u201d), contacted Stifel. Jefferies\ncommunicated that ArchiMed may be willing to increase the per share price in the Initial ArchiMed Proposal but\nwould require access to due diligence information as a first step.\nOn February 25, 2022, the Company and ArchiMed entered into a confidentiality agreement (which contained a\n\u201cstandstill\u201d provision that, among other things, would automatically terminate if the Company were to enter into a\ndefinitive agreement to sell more than 50% of its capital stock or consolidated assets).\nDuring March 2021, ArchiMed conducted its due diligence of the Company.\nOn March 17, 2022, the Board of Directors met, with representatives from Stifel in attendance. The Board of Directors\nconfirmed that the Management Projections were authorized and directed to be used by Stifel for the purposes of\nStifel\u2019s financial analysis of fairness of the consideration proposed to be paid in the proposed transaction. The\nrepresentatives from Stifel then reviewed the Initial ArchiMed Proposal from a financial point of view based on\ninformation provided by the Company\u2019s management, including the Management Projections, and publicly available\ninformation. Representatives from Stifel also briefed the Board of Directors on ArchiMed\u2019s progress to date on due\ndiligence matters. The representatives from Stifel briefed the Board of Directors on the absence of any material\nrelationships between Stifel and ArchiMed.\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn March 28, 2022, ArchiMed submitted a revised written proposal to acquire the Company for $33 per share in cash\n(the \u201c1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal\u201d).\nOn March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors held a meeting. Also in attendance were members of management,\nrepresentatives from Stifel and a representative from Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the Company\u2019s outside counsel\n(\u201cDavis Polk\u201d). The representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under\nDelaware law. The Board of Directors discussed the 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal. The representatives from Stifel\nreviewed the 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal from a financial point of view based on information provided by the\nCompany\u2019s management, including the Management Projections, and publicly available information. The Board of\nDirectors then temporarily adjourned the meeting. Later that day, the Board of Directors resumed the meeting with\nonly the directors in attendance. The Board of Directors determined to instruct Stifel to encourage ArchiMed to\nimprove the terms of the 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal. The Board of Directors also determined to instruct Davis\nPolk to prepare a form of Merger Agreement with terms that are consistent with the terms of the merger agreement\nthat had been negotiated with Financial Sponsor A in March 2021 that could be used for a transaction between the\nCompany and ArchiMed.\nOn March 31, 2022, Stifel provided to Jefferies the form of Merger Agreement prepared by Davis Polk for a proposed\ntransaction between the Company and ArchiMed, but also communicated to Jefferies that in order for the Company\nto be willing to continue discussions with ArchiMed and to continue to provide due diligence information to\nArchiMed, that ArchiMed would need to improve its 1st Revised ArchiMed Proposal.\nOn April 1, 2022, Jefferies, on behalf of ArchiMed, delivered to Stifel a further revised proposal to acquire the\nCompany for $33.50 per share in cash (the \u201c2nd Revised ArchiMed Proposal\u201d). Jefferies communicated, on behalf of\nArchiMed, that this was ArchiMed\u2019s best and final offer, and would be conditioned upon ArchiMed receiving\nexclusivity through 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022.\nOn April 2, 2022, the Board of Directors met. Also in attendance were members of management, representatives from\nStifel and representatives from Davis Polk. Representatives from Stifel reviewed with the Board of Directors the 2nd\nRevised ArchiMed Proposal from a financial point of view, and informed the Board of Directors that the 2nd Revised\nArchiMed Proposal was ArchiMed\u2019s best and final offer. The Board of Directors noted that ArchiMed had twice\nraised its price per share, and that there was a significant risk that were the Board of Directors to delay the process by\nseeking a further increase in the price per share, that ArchiMed would discontinue discussions. The representative\nfrom Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms of the Merger Agreement that had been provided to\nArchiMed and noted for the Board of Directors that, consistent with the Board of Directors\u2019 instruction, the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement were substantially similar to the merger agreement that had been negotiated with Financial\nSponsor A in March 2021, including the presence of a \u201cgo shop\u201d provision that would permit the Company to\nactively solicit more favorable offers. The Board of Directors also discussed the ArchiMed request for exclusivity\nuntil 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022, noting that it was a short period of time encompassing 11 days of\nexclusivity and, in light of the absence of other interested parties and the presence of the \u201cgo-shop period\u201d in the\nMerger Agreement, was not likely to discourage other, more favorable offers. Representatives from Stifel and Davis\nPolk also reviewed with the Board of Directors the structure of the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision. After discussion, the Board\nof Directors authorized and directed management, Stifel and Davis Polk to proceed with discussions and negotiations\nwith ArchiMed and its advisors, including on the Merger Agreement and the exclusivity letter.\nAlso on April 2, 2022, Stifel contacted Jefferies and communicated that the Company was willing to continue\ndiscussions. Later during that same day, ArchiMed\u2019s counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d) sent a draft\nexclusivity letter to Davis Polk which provided for exclusivity through 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022, which\nLatham and Davis Polk negotiated. The exclusivity agreement was signed by the Company and ArchiMed on April 2,\n2022.\nOn April 3, 2022, ArchiMed and Latham began conducting confirmatory due diligence on the Company. This\nconfirmatory due diligence also included video conferences with members of Company management and continued\nreview of information in a virtual dataroom. On April 4, 2022, Davis Polk sent a draft of the Company disclosure letter\nto Latham.\nOn April 7, 2022, Latham sent a markup of the proposed Merger Agreement to Davis Polk. On April 8, 2022, Davis\nPolk reviewed the markup with members of management, and then held a conference call with Latham to negotiate the\nterms of the Merger Agreement, including, among other provisions, the \u201cgo shop\u201d and\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nno solicitation clauses, the break-up fee and reverse break-up fee, the termination provisions, the interim operating\ncovenants and other covenants, and the representations and warranties. Davis Polk sent a revised draft of the\nMerger Agreement to Latham during the evening of April 8, 2022.\nOn April 10, 2022, Latham sent a markup of the revised Merger Agreement and a markup of the Company disclosure\nletter to Davis Polk.\nOn April 11, 2022, Latham sent drafts of the equity commitment letter, the debt commitment letter and the limited\nguaranty to Davis Polk.\nAlso on April 11, 2022, Davis Polk reviewed the markups with members of management, and then held a conference\ncall with Latham to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company disclosure letter and the other\ntransaction agreements. Davis Polk sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and the Company disclosure letter\nto Latham during the evening of April 11, 2022.\nOn April 12, 2022, Mr. Bateman spoke with Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Bateman stated that, in order for ArchiMed to be willing\nto enter into the transaction with the Company, ArchiMed would require that Mr. Sullivan sign a retention letter (the\n\u201cRetention Letter\u201d) pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Sullivan would agree to receive less favorable\ntreatment of his equity awards as compared to other employees of the Company. Mr. Sullivan said he would consider\nthis request and updated the chairman of the Board of Directors of such request.\nAlso on April 12, 2022, during discussions between Mr. Bateman and Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Bateman expressed\nArchiMed\u2019s concern over the treatment of outstanding MSUs proposed by Natus in the Merger Agreement, namely,\nthat all MSUs would be treated as if all performance hurdles had been fully satisfied, which in the view of ArchiMed\nwould increase costs associated with the transaction while diminishing the post-closing retention incentives in place\nfor key managers. After further discussions, Mr. Sullivan communicated to Mr. Bateman that, if necessary for\nArchiMed to proceed with the proposed transaction, Mr. Sullivan would be willing to agree to less favorable\ntreatment of his outstanding MSUs as compared to all other MSU holders (resulting in Mr. Sullivan receiving\n$3,000,000 less than he would otherwise receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement), and Mr. Sullivan would\nagree that $6,000,000 of proceeds in respect of his outstanding equity-based awards that he would otherwise be\nentitled to receive at closing would instead be held back and paid to Mr. Sullivan as compensation for his services for\ncertain periods after closing. Mr. Sullivan\u2019s rationale for being willing to agree to these concessions was: (i) his\nconcern that ArchiMed would be otherwise unwilling to proceed with the proposed transaction (and that would\ndeprive the Company Stockholders of the choice as to whether or not to vote to accept a transaction that would\nprovide a substantial premium)\u037e (ii) in the unlikely event that ArchiMed were otherwise willing to proceed, Mr.\nSullivan believed that (a) ArchiMed would decrease the price per share payable to the Company Stockholders to an\namount less than $33.50 per share and (b) ArchiMed would require that all of the Company\u2019s employees forego\nacceleration of all or a portion of their equity awards, which would make employees less likely to remain at the\nCompany pending closing and potentially jeopardize the operation of the Company\u2019s business\u037e and (iii) Mr.\nSullivan\u2019s MSUs would be paid out at the level of performance actually achieved through the closing based on the\nper share price of $33.50, consistent with the level of return to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nOn April 13, 2022, Latham sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the Company disclosure letter to Davis\nPolk.\nLater that evening on April 13, 2022, the Board of Directors met. Also in attendance were members of management,\nrepresentatives of Stifel and representatives of Davis Polk. Copies of the Merger Agreement and other transaction\nagreements and a financial presentation by Stifel and a legal presentation by Davis Polk, had been provided to the\nBoard of Directors in advance of the meeting. A representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors\ntheir fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the material terms of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction\nagreements, as well as the outstanding issues. A representative from Stifel reviewed their preliminary financial\nanalyses with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $33.50 per share in cash price that\nArchiMed was proposing. Mr. Sullivan noted for the Board of Directors that there were still outstanding issues to be\nresolved, including the amount of the break-up fee and reverse break-up fee, the events that would trigger payment\nof those fees, the no solicitation clause and on the regulatory undertaking covenant. The Board of Directors\ninstructed management, Stifel and Davis Polk to continue to work toward resolving the remaining outstanding issues\nin a manner as favorably as possible to the Company Stockholders.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on April 13, 2022, the exclusivity period expired. In light of a potential transaction with\nArchiMed being close to signing, the Board of Directors noted that contacting other parties at this time had the risk\nof creating opportunities for public speculation that the Company was pursuing a sale, and that such speculation\ncould be harmful to the Company and its employees and business partners, and could cause the loss of the potential\ntransaction with ArchiMed. In light of these considerations, the Board of Directors determined that the risks of\ncontacting additional potential acquirers outweighed the benefits.\nOn April 14, 2022, Davis Polk spoke with Latham to negotiate the outstanding issues in the Merger Agreement and\nthe other transaction agreements, including, among others, as to the break-up fee, the reverse break-up fee, the\ncircumstances under which each was payable, and the regulatory undertaking covenant. Later on April 14, 2022,\nDavis Polk sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction agreements to Latham.\nOn April 15, 2022, Mr. Sullivan spoke with Mr. Bateman regarding the outstanding issues. Later that day, Latham sent\nrevised drafts of the Merger Agreement and other transaction agreements to Davis Polk. Davis Polk and Latham\nnegotiated the outstanding issues. Davis Polk sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction\nagreements to Latham late in the evening on April 15, 2022.\nOn April 16, 2022, Mr. Sullivan spoke again with Mr. Bateman regarding the remaining outstanding issues. Thereafter,\nDavis Polk and Latham finalized the Merger Agreement and the other transaction agreements.\nOn the morning of April 17, 2022, the Board of Directors met. Also in attendance were members of management,\nrepresentatives of Stifel and representatives of Davis Polk. Copies of the Merger Agreement and other transaction\nagreements and a financial presentation by Stifel and a legal presentation by Davis Polk, had been provided to the\nBoard of Directors in advance of the meeting. A representative of Davis Polk reviewed with the Board of Directors\ntheir fiduciary duties under Delaware law, as well as the material terms of the Merger Agreement and the other\ntransaction agreements. The representative of Davis Polk also reviewed with the Board of Directors the resolution of\nthe outstanding issues. A representative from Stifel reviewed Stifel\u2019s financial analysis of the $33.50 per share in cash\nmerger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 17, 2022, to\nthe Board of Directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters considered, the\nprocedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken,\nthe $33.50 per share in cash merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock. Stifel also reviewed again with the Board of Directors its relationships with ArchiMed (as more fully\ndescribed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Opinion of Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated\u201d).\nThe Board of Directors, after considering the reasons and factors more fully described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201c-Recommendation of the Board of Directors and the Reasons for the Merger,\u201d (1) determined\nthat the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were in\nthe best interests of the Company and its stockholders and (2) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger\nAgreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and\nthe consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (3) resolved\nto recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. Subsequently, the compensation\ncommittee of the Board of Directors met and adopted resolutions providing for the treatment of equity awards in the\nMerger Agreement, and certain other matters.\nThe Company and entities formed by ArchiMed subsequently signed the Merger Agreement and the other\ntransaction agreements.\nEarly on April 18, 2022, before the opening of trading on the NASDAQ, the Company publicly disclosed the\nproposed transaction.\nDuring the Go-Shop Period, at the direction and under the supervision of the Board of Directors, representatives of\nStifel contacted parties that, in the view of the Board of Directors, based on advice from Stifel, might be capable of,\nand might be interested in, pursuing an acquisition of the Company on terms that could reasonably be expected to be\nmore favorable to the Company and its stockholders. During the go-shop period, and at the direction of the Board of\nDirectors, representatives of Stifel contacted a total of 31 parties (collectively, the \u201cGo Shop Parties\u201d), including 12\nstrategic parties (including Strategic Party A) and 19 financial sponsors (including Financial Sponsor A), to solicit\ntheir interest in a possible acquisition of the Company.\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOf the Go Shop Parties contacted by representatives of Stifel, 3 parties executed confidentiality agreements and were\ngranted access to certain non-public information regarding the Company. Certain of the parties that executed\nconfidentiality agreements asked diligence questions of, and received answers from, the Company and engaged in\nadditional discussion with representatives of Stifel. None of the Go Shop Parties contacted, nor any other party, has\nsubmitted an alternative acquisition proposal to the Company as of the date of this proxy statement that the Board of\nDirectors believes could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.",

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated\nIn connection with the Merger, Natus retained Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (\u201cStifel\u201d) to provide it with\nfinancial advisory services and to provide the Board of Directors an opinion in connection with the possible sale of\nNatus. As part of that engagement, on April 17, 2022, Stifel delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated April 17, 2022 (the \u201cOpinion\u201d), that, as of\nthat date and based upon and subject to the various limitations, matters, qualifications and assumptions set forth\ntherein, the Per Share Price to be received by holders of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company\nShares and Dissenting Company Shares (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) (collectively, the \u201cExcluded\nShares\u201d) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such holders, from a financial point of view.\nNatus did not impose any limitations on Stifel with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed in\nrendering the Opinion. In selecting Stifel, the Board of Directors considered, among other things, the fact that Stifel is\na reputable investment banking firm with substantial experience advising companies in the healthcare and medical\ntechnology sectors and in providing strategic advisory services in general. Stifel, as part of its investment banking\nbusiness, is regularly engaged in the independent valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers,\nacquisitions, underwritings, sales, and distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and\nvaluations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, Stifel and its clients may\ntransact in the equity securities of Natus and Parent or its affiliates and may at any time hold a long or short position\nin such securities.\nThe full text of the Opinion that Stifel delivered to the Board of Directors is attached to this proxy statement as\nAnnex B and is incorporated into this document by reference. The summary of the Opinion set forth in this proxy\nstatement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Opinion. Company Stockholders are urged to\nread the Opinion carefully and in its entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limits of the review undertaken by Stifel in connection with the Opinion.\nThe Opinion was for the information of, and directed to, the Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) for its\ninformation and assistance in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the Merger. The Opinion did\nnot constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to how the Board of Directors should vote or otherwise\nact on the Merger or any other matter or to any stockholder of Natus as to how any such stockholder should act with\nrespect to the Merger or any other matter, including, without limitation, how to vote at any stockholders\u2019 meeting at\nwhich the Merger is considered, or whether or not to enter into a voting, stockholders\u2019, or affiliates\u2019 agreement with\nrespect to the Merger, or exercise any dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights that may be available to such stockholder. In\naddition, the Opinion did not compare the relative merits of the Merger with any other alternative transactions or\nbusiness strategies that may have been available to Natus and did not address the underlying business decision of\nthe Board of Directors or Natus to proceed with or effect the Merger.\nIn connection with the Opinion, Stifel, among other things:\n\u2022\ndiscussed the Merger and related matters with Natus\u2019 management and counsel and reviewed the financial\nterms of the Merger contained in a draft dated April 16, 2022, of the Merger Agreement (the \u201cDraft Merger\nAgreement\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the audited consolidated financial statements of Natus contained in its Annual Reports on Form\n10-K for the three years ended December 31, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and discussed with Natus\u2019 management certain other publicly available information concerning\nNatus\u037e\n48TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nreviewed and discussed with Natus\u2019 management certain non-publicly available information concerning\nNatus, including, without limitation, internal financial analyses, financial projections, reports, and other\ninformation prepared by its management, including, without limitation, Natus\u2019 strategic plan (the \u201cNatus\nStrategic Plan\u201d), utilized by Stifel pursuant to instructions from Natus, and held discussions with Natus\u2019\nsenior management regarding recent developments\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information concerning the terms of selected merger and\nacquisition transactions that Stifel considered relevant to its analysis\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial and stock market data relating to selected public\ncompanies that Stifel deemed relevant to its analysis\u037e\n\u2022\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations between representatives of Natus and the Parent\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity of the equity securities of Natus\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed and analyzed, based on the Natus Strategic Plan, the cash flows generated by Natus to determine\nthe present value of those discounted cash flows\u037e\n\u2022\nconsidered the results of Stifel\u2019s efforts, at the direction of Natus, to solicit indications of interest from\nselected third parties with respect to a merger or other transaction with Natus\u037e\n\u2022\nconducted such other financial studies, analyses, and investigations and considered such other\ninformation as Stifel deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of the Opinion\u037e and\n\u2022\ntook into account its assessment of general economic, market, and financial conditions and Stifel\u2019s\nexperience in other transactions, as well as Stifel\u2019s experience in securities valuations and its knowledge of\nNatus\u2019 industry generally.\nIn conducting its review and rendering the Opinion, Stifel relied upon and assumed, without independent verification,\nthe accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was provided to Stifel by or on behalf\nof Natus, or that was otherwise reviewed by Stifel, and Stifel did not assume any responsibility for independently\nverifying any of such information. With respect to the financial forecasts supplied to Stifel by Natus (including,\nwithout limitation, the financial forecasts contained in the Natus Strategic Plan and the price to be received for certain\nassets (the \u201cSpecified Assets\u201d) assumed to be divested in the Natus Strategic Plan), Stifel assumed, at the direction\nof Natus, that they were reasonably prepared on the basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of the management of Natus as to the future operating and financial performance of Natus and that they\nprovided a reasonable basis upon which Stifel could form its opinion. Such forecasts and projections were not\nprepared with the expectation of public disclosure. All such forecasted and projected financial information was based\non numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to\ngeneral economic and competitive conditions, including, without limitation, assumptions regarding the widespread\ndisruption, extraordinary uncertainty, and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nthe conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such forecasted\nand projected financial information. Stifel relied on this forecasted and projected information, including, without\nlimitation, estimates of the management of Natus of the price to be received for the Specified Assets, without\nindependent verification or analyses and did not in any respect assume any responsibility for the accuracy or\ncompleteness thereof. Stifel expressed no opinion as to any such forecasted or projected information or any other\nestimates or the assumptions on which they were made.\nStifel also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of\noperations, business, or prospects of Natus since the date of the last financial information made available to Stifel.\nStifel did not make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal, or physical inspection of Natus\u2019 assets or\nliabilities, nor was Stifel furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Estimates of values of companies and assets\ndo not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold.\nBecause such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, Stifel assumed no responsibility for their accuracy.\nStifel assumed that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ materially from the Draft Merger Agreement.\nStifel also assumed the Merger would be consummated substantially on the terms and conditions described in the\nMerger Agreement without any waiver of material terms or conditions by Natus or any other\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nparty and without any anti-dilution or other adjustment to the Merger Consideration, and that obtaining any\nnecessary regulatory approvals or satisfying any other conditions for the consummation of the Merger would not\nhave an adverse effect on Natus or the Merger. Stifel also assumed that the Merger would be consummated in a\nmanner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d),\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal, state and foreign statutes, rules and\nregulations. Stifel further assumed that Natus has relied upon the advice of its counsel, independent accountants,\nand other advisors (other than Stifel) as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting, and regulatory matters with\nrespect to Natus, the Merger, and the Merger Agreement.\nThe Opinion was limited to whether, as of the date of the Opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of\nCompany Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), from a financial point of view, and did not address any other\nterms, aspects or implications of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any\nconsequences of the Merger on Natus, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects or implications\nof any voting, support, stockholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered\ninto in connection with the Merger or otherwise. The Opinion also did not consider, address or include: (i) any other\nstrategic alternatives currently (or which have been or may be) contemplated by the Board of Directors or Natus\u037e (ii)\nthe legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting or regulatory consequences of the Merger on Natus or the holders of\nShares\u037e (iii) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of Natus\u2019 officers, directors or\nemployees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of Natus\u2019 securities or otherwise\u037e\n(iv) the effect of the Merger on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of\nsecurities of Natus, or any class of securities of any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement\u037e (v) whether the Parent had sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it\nto pay the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock at the closing of the Merger\u037e or (vi) the\ntreatment of, or effect of the Merger on, Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company\nOptions. Furthermore, Stifel did not express any opinion herein as to the prices, trading range, or volume at which\nNatus\u2019 securities would trade following the public announcement of the Merger.\nThe Opinion was necessarily based on economic, market, financial, and other conditions as they existed on, and on\nthe information made available to Stifel by or on behalf of Natus or its advisors, or information otherwise reviewed by\nStifel as of the date of the Opinion. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion\nreached in the Opinion and that Stifel does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the Opinion. Further,\nas the Board of Directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility\nand Stifel expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on Natus, the Parent, or the\nMerger.\nStifel is not a legal, tax, regulatory or bankruptcy advisor. Stifel has not considered any potential legislative or\nregulatory changes currently being considered or recently enacted by the United States Congress, the various\nfederal banking agencies, the SEC, or any other regulatory bodies, or any changes in accounting methods or\ngenerally accepted accounting principles that may be adopted by the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, or any changes in regulatory accounting principles that may be adopted by any or all of the federal banking\nagencies. The Opinion is not a solvency opinion and did not in any way address the solvency or financial condition\nof Natus or the Parent or any other person. The Opinion was approved by Stifel\u2019s fairness opinion committee.\nThe following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by Stifel in arriving at the Opinion and\npresented by Stifel to the Board of Directors. In accordance with customary investment banking practice, Stifel\nemployed generally accepted valuation methods and financial analyses in reaching the Opinion. These summaries of\nfinancial analyses alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses Stifel employed in reaching\nits conclusions. None of the analyses performed by Stifel were assigned a greater significance by Stifel than any\nother, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nStifel. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The per share equity\nvalues implied by Stifel\u2019s analyses are rounded to the nearest dollar. In order to fully understand the financial\nanalyses used by Stifel, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The summary text describing each financial analysis does\nnot constitute a complete description of Stifel\u2019s financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions\nunderlying the analyses, and if viewed in isolation could create a\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmisleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Stifel. The summary text set forth below does\nnot represent and should not be viewed by anyone as constituting conclusions reached by Stifel with respect to any\nof the analyses performed by it in connection with the Opinion. Rather, Stifel made its determination as to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Company\nCommon Stock (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement on the basis of its experience and\nprofessional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses performed.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the information utilized by Stifel in its analyses, to the extent based on market data, was\nbased on market data as it existed on or before April 17, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative of current market\nconditions. The analyses described below do not purport to be indicative of actual future results or to reflect the\nprices at which any securities may trade in the public markets, which may vary depending upon various factors,\nincluding changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions, economic conditions and other factors that\ninfluence the price of securities.\nSelected Public Companies Analysis\nStifel reviewed certain publicly available financial data and stock market information for several selected public\ncompanies in the medical technology sector. The selected public companies were:\n\u2022\nAvanos Medical, Inc.\n\u2022\nCONMED Corporation\n\u2022\nConvaTec Group Plc\n\u2022\nICU Medical, Inc.\n\u2022\nIntegra LifeSciences Holdings\n\u2022\nLivaNova Plc\n\u2022\nMerit Medical Systems, Inc.\n\u2022\nNuVasive, Inc.\n\u2022\nOrthofix Medical, Inc.\nFor each selected public company, Stifel calculated multiples of enterprise value (defined as equity value, based on\nclosing stock prices on April 14, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger), plus total debt\nless cash, as obtained from publicly available sources) compared to actual or estimated earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, for calendar years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The\nthird quartile and first quartile multiples for the selected public companies implied by this analysis are set forth in the\ntable below:\n2021A EBITDA\n2022P\nEBITDA\n2023P\nEBITDA\n3rd Quartile\n17.3x\n18.8x\n16.8x\n1st Quartile\n15.5x\n12.7x\n11.4x\nStifel then applied these EBITDA multiples to the corresponding Natus actual EBITDA for the fiscal year 2021 (\u201c2021\nEBITDA\u201d) and the projected EBITDA for the fiscal year 2022 (\u201cprojected 2022 EBITDA\u201d) and for the fiscal year 2023\n(\u201cprojected 2023 EBITDA\u201d), which pursuant to the Natus Strategic Plan reflected the pro forma impact of certain\npotential divestitures, or the \u201cPotential Divestitures,\u201d to determine ranges of implied enterprise values for Natus.\nBased on these implied enterprise value ranges, Stifel calculated ranges of implied equity values for Natus (calculated\nas enterprise value minus total debt plus cash), with the implied equity values based on projected 2022 EBITDA and\nprojected 2023 EBITDA adjusted to include the net present value of the after-tax proceeds from the Potential\nDivestitures as set forth in the Natus Strategic Plan (the \u201cEstimated Divestiture Proceeds\u201d), as estimated by Natus\nmanagement. The per share equity value ranges for Natus implied by this analysis are set forth in the table below:\n2021A EBITDA\n2022P\nEBITDA\n2023P\nEBITDA\n3rd Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$33\n$32\n$36\n1st Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$30\n$23\n$26\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNo company utilized in the selected public company analysis is identical to Natus. Stifel chose the selected public\ncompanies on the basis of various factors, including the size of the companies, the similarity of the lines of business\nand the similarity of the financial profiles, although no company is identical to Natus. Accordingly, these analyses are\nnot purely mathematical, but also involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in\nfinancial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and other factors.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nStifel reviewed certain publicly available information relating to 22 selected business combination transactions\nannounced on or subsequent to February 26, 2015, involving medical technology companies. The selected precedent\ntransactions are set forth in the table below:\nDate \nAnnounced\nTarget Name\nAcquiror Name\n09/08/21\nSmiths Medical\nICU Medical\n09/02/21\nHill-Rom Holdings, Inc.\nBaxter International, Inc.\n07/30/19\nHu-Friedy Mfg.

Estimated financial data of the selected\ntransactions were based on publicly available information. The third quartile and first quartile multiples for the\nselected precedent transactions implied by this analysis are set forth in the table below:\nLTM EBITDA\nNTM EBITDA\n3rd Quartile\n16.1x\n15.3x\n1st Quartile\n11.8x\n11.9x\nStifel then applied the LTM EBITDA multiples to Natus\u2019 actual 2021 EBITDA and the NTM EBITDA multiples to\nNatus\u2019 projected 2022 EBITDA, adjusted to include the net present value of the after-tax proceeds (as estimated by\nNatus management) from the Estimated Divestiture Proceeds. Based on these implied enterprise value ranges, Stifel\ncalculated ranges of implied equity values for Natus. The implied range based on projected 2022 EBITDA was\nadjusted to include the Estimated Divestiture Proceeds. The per share equity value ranges for Natus implied by this\nanalysis are set forth in the table below:\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n2021A EBITDA\n2022P\nEBITDA\n3rd Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$31\n$27\n1st Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$23\n$22\nNo transaction utilized in the selected precedent transaction analysis is identical to the Merger. Stifel chose the\nselected precedent transactions on the basis of various factors and no company is identical to Natus. Accordingly,\nthese analyses are not purely mathematical, but also involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the\ndifferences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved in the selected precedent\ntransactions and other factors.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nStifel used Natus management\u2019s financial projections of unlevered free cash flow for fiscal years 2022 through 2026\ncontained in the Natus Strategic Plan to perform a discounted cash flow analysis of Natus. Financial projections for\nthe fiscal year 2022 reflected the pro forma impact of the Potential Divestitures assuming the Potential Divestitures\noccurred on June 30, 2022.\nStifel calculated the terminal value of Natus\u2019 projected unlevered free cash flow by applying a range of perpetuity\ngrowth rates of 2.0% to 4.0% to Natus\u2019 projected calendar year 2026 free cash flow. Stifel then discounted the cash\nflows and terminal value to present values using discount rates ranging from 10% to 12%, based on Natus\u2019 weighted\naverage cost of capital, using the capital asset pricing model, considering Natus\u2019 company-specific circumstances\nand Stifel\u2019s judgment. This analysis yielded a range of implied enterprise values for Natus from which Stifel calculated\na range of implied equity values for Natus. The per share equity value range for Natus implied by this analysis ranges\nfrom $24 to $36.\nOther Information\nFor the information of the Board of Directors, Stifel also prepared certain other analyses for illustrative purposes only\nand not as part of its fairness analysis.\nPremiums Paid Analysis\nFor illustrative purposes only, Stifel reviewed the premiums paid for acquisitions of 278 publicly traded U.S.\ncompanies announced, and subsequently completed, from January 1, 2016 to April 14, 2022, where the total\ntransaction value was between $500.0 million and $2.0 billion, excluding spinoffs, minority stakes, and insolvency-\nrelated deals. Stifel calculated the percentage by which the upfront per share consideration paid in such transactions\nexceeded the target company\u2019s closing share price one day prior to the announcement of such precedent transaction.\nThe resultants of Stifel\u2019s calculations are as follows:\n1-Day (%) \nOffer Premiums\n3rd Quartile\n43.6\n1st Quartile\n9.7\nStifel then applied these premiums to the closing price of Natus\u2019 shares on April 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to\nthe announcement of the Merger, resulting in implied per share values set forth in the table below.\n3rd Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$37\n1st Quartile - Implied Equity Value Per Share\n$29\nHistorical Trading Range for the Company Common Stock\nFor illustrative purposes only, Stifel reviewed the historical trading prices of the Company Common Stock for the 52\nweeks prior to the date of the announcement of the Merger. During this period, the closing price per share of the\nCompany Common Stock ranged from $22 to $30.\nMiscellaneous\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its Opinion, Stifel considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did\nnot attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Stifel believes that\n53\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe summary provided and the analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions\nof these analyses, without considering all of them, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying Stifel\u2019s\nanalyses and Opinion\u037e therefore, the ranges of valuations and relative valuations resulting from any particular\nanalysis described above should not be taken to be Stifel\u2019s view of the actual valuation of the company or its relative\nvaluation.\nStifel is acting as financial advisor to Natus in connection with the Merger. Natus agreed to pay Stifel a fee for its\nservices that as of the date of the Merger Agreement was estimated to be approximately $18 million, $1.5 million of\nwhich became payable upon the delivery of the Opinion, and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon the\nclosing of the Merger. Natus has also agreed to reimburse Stifel for its expenses incurred in connection with Stifel\u2019s\nengagement and to indemnify Stifel and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents,\nand any persons controlling Stifel or any of its affiliates, against specified liabilities. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, Stifel and its clients may transact in the equity securities of each of Natus or Parent or its affiliates and may\nat any time hold a long or short position in such securities. Stifel may seek to provide investment banking or financial\nadvisory services to Natus or Parent and its affiliates in the future, for which Stifel would seek customary\ncompensation.\nIn their Opinion, Stifel also confirmed to the Board of Directors that there were no material relationships that existed\nduring the two years prior to the date of the Opinion or that were mutually understood to be contemplated in which\nany compensation was received or was intended to be received as a result of the relationship between Stifel and any\nparty to the Merger.",

In (i) evaluating and negotiating\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) recommending the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iii) recommending that the\nMerger Agreement be adopted by Company Stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these\ninterests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.\nInsurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers\nDuring the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the\nSurviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the\nfullest extent permitted by DGCL, each current or former director and officer of Natus (and any person who becomes a\ndirector or officer of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (\u201cIndemnified Person\u201d) from and\nagainst any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented\n55TABLE OF CONTENTS\nattorneys\u2019 fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in\nsettlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or\nindirectly, with respect to any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person\u2019s\ncapacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of Natus or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to the extent\nthat such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including any\nmatters arising in connection with the Merger Agreement or the Merger).\nDuring the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the\nSurviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries\nto) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving\nCorporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the\nadvancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of\nexpenses provisions set forth in the charter, the bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the\nSubsidiaries of Natus, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger Agreement that have been made available to Parent\nprior to the date thereof. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise\nmodified in any manner except as required by applicable law.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth\nanniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)\nmaintain Natus\u2019 current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, \u201cD&O\nInsurance\u201d) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect\nto coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are substantially equivalent to those of the D&O\nInsurance\u037e provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer (of the same\nor better credit worthiness and financial capability) of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and\nconditions that are no less advantageous to the insured thereunder. The Surviving Corporation will not be obligated\nto pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium amount paid by Natus for coverage for its last full\nfiscal year (such 300% amount, the \u201cMaximum Annual Premium\u201d). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage\nexceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the\ngreatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the\nsame or better credit rating as Natus\u2019 current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective\nTime, Natus may (and if Natus is unable to purchase such a policy prior to Closing, Parent shall) purchase a prepaid\nsix-year \u201ctail\u201d policy with respect to the D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating\nas Natus\u2019 current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such \u201ctail\u201d policy\ndoes not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If Natus (or Parent) purchases such a \u201ctail\u201d policy prior to the\nEffective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such\n\u201ctail\u201d policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such \u201ctail\u201d policy\nis in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time.\nTreatment of Natus Equity-Based Awards\nThe Merger Agreement provides that Natus\u2019 equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective\nTime will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:\nCompany Options\nAs of the record date, there were outstanding Company Options to purchase 169,548 shares of Company Common\nStock (all of which were In-the-Money Company Options), of which Company Options to purchase 107,894 shares of\nCompany Common Stock were held by our executive officers. No Company Options were held by our non-employee\ndirectors. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective\nTime, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, and that is an\nIn-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in\ncash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less\nthe exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of\nCompany Common Stock that are issuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option.\n56\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEach Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company Option will be cancelled without any cash payment\nbeing made in respect thereof.\nCompany Restricted Stock\nAs of the record date, there were outstanding 390,075 shares of Company Restricted Stock, of which 232,042 were\nheld by our non-employee directors and executive officers. At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with\nrespect to Employee Interim Awards, each share of Company Restricted Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will\nbe cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to\nany required tax withholding, equal to the Per Share Price.\nCompany Restricted Stock Units\nAs of the record date, there were outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units in respect of 1,140,733 shares of\nCompany Common Stock (at the maximum level with respect awards subject to performance-based vesting criteria), of\nwhich 114,539 were subject only to time-vesting criteria, 380,570 were MSUs and 645,624 were subject to vesting\nbased on achievement of certain total shareholder return or earnings per share metrics (\u201cPSUs\u201d). Of the total number\nof outstanding Company Restricted Stock Units as of the record date, our current non-employee directors and\nexecutive officers held Company Restricted Stock Units in respect of 951,375 shares (at the maximum level with\nrespect to awards subject to performance-based vesting criteria). At the Effective Time, except as set forth below with\nrespect to Employee Interim Awards or as set forth in the CEO Retention Agreement, each Company Restricted Stock\nUnit outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not\ngranted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, will be cancelled and be converted into and will become a right to\nreceive an amount in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding, equal to (i) the amount of the\nPer Share Price\u037e multiplied by (ii) (1) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-\nvesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted\nStock Unit, and (2) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting\nrequirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the\nperformance goals deemed achieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed\nsatisfied.\nEmployee Interim Awards\nAs of the record date, there were no outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock or Company Restricted Stock\nUnits that were Employee Interim Awards. At the Effective Time, any Employee Interim Awards that are outstanding\nas of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested and whether or not granted pursuant to any\nCompany Stock Plan, will be treated at the Effective Time in the manner set forth above, provided that any applicable\nperformance goals will be deemed achieved at target levels (rather than at maximum) and the number of shares subject\nto such Employee Interim Awards that will vest at the Effective Time will be prorated to reflect the portion of the\napplicable vesting period that has elapsed from the date of grant until the Effective Time (rather than vesting in full),\nand the remaining unvested portion of any Employee Interim Awards will be forfeited at the Effective Time.\nCEO Retention Agreement\nPursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that, notwithstanding the treatment of Company\nRestricted Stock Units set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described above), he would not receive payment in\nrespect of his Company Restricted Stock Units that are MSUs based on deemed achievement of performance goals at\nmaximum levels. Instead, Mr. Sullivan\u2019s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of performance actually achieved\nthrough the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of target, in the case of MSUs\ngranted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in\nJanuary 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nThe consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of gross proceeds that he\notherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the\n\u201cRetention Payment\u201d) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company\n57\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRestricted Stock Units would not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on\nthe six-month anniversary of the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his\ncontinued employment with the Company until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment is terminated\nby the Company without cause, by Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid\nportion of the Retention Payment shall be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a termination by\nthe Company without cause or by Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-revocation of a release of\nclaims). If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment terminates for any other reason prior to the relevant retention date, he will\nimmediately forfeit all portions of the Retention Payment that relate to a future retention date. Mr. Sullivan\u2019s right to\nreceive the Retention Payment is further subject to his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants.\nTreatment of ESPP\nThere are no outstanding purchase rights under the Company\u2019s 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Even if the\nAmended and Restated 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is adopted by the Company\u2019s stockholders at its 2022\nannual meeting, the Merger Agreement does not permit any employee to commence participation in the ESPP and\nrequires that the ESPP be terminated as of the Effective Time.\nPayments Upon Termination In Connection with a Change of Control\nChange of Control Severance Benefits.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with each of our currently employed named executive officers (except\nfor Dr. Chung) that provide for severance payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment, including\nfollowing a change of control, subject to the named executive officer\u2019s execution of an effective release of claims and\ncontinued compliance with an 18-month (or, for Mr. Sullivan, 24-month) post-termination of employment employee\nnon-solicitation covenant and other restrictive covenants. The severance payments and benefits that could become\npayable under these agreements in connection with a change of control are summarized below. As used in the\nsummary below, the terms \u201ccause,\u201d \u201cgood reason,\u201d and \u201cchange of control\u201d have the meanings set forth in the\napplicable employment agreement:\nEmployment Agreement and CEO Retention Agreement with Mr. Sullivan\nIn connection with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer on December 27, 2021, we entered into\nan employment agreement with Mr. Sullivan. Pursuant to his employment agreement with us, in the event that Mr.\nSullivan\u2019s employment terminates other than for cause, death or disability or Mr. Sullivan resigns for good reason, in\neach case, within three months prior to or 24 months following the Effective Time, he would be entitled to the\nfollowing severance payments and benefits:\n\u2022\nA lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and target annual bonus as then\nin effect or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to our entering into the Merger Agreement, payable\nwithin 30 days following such termination\u037e\n\u2022\nA prorated target annual bonus for the year of termination, with the prorated amount based on the number\nof days that Mr. Sullivan was employed during the year prior to termination of service, paid no later than\nMarch 15 of the year following such termination\u037e and\n\u2022\nContinuation of the level of group health coverage provided by the Company to Mr. Sullivan and his\neligible dependents at the time of termination until the third December 31st from the effective date of such\ntermination (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Sullivan and each of his eligible dependents become covered\nunder similar plans).\nMr. Sullivan\u2019s entitlement to the foregoing severance payments is conditioned upon (i) the executive executing and\nnot revoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and its officers and directors and (ii) the executive\u2019s\ncompliance with a 24-month employee and customer non-solicitation covenant (and in the event of a breach, Mr.\nSullivan is required to return to the Company a prorated amount of the foregoing cash severance payments,\ndetermined by multiplying the amount of cash payments by a fraction, the numerator of which is 24 minus the number\nof months from the date of termination to the date of breach, and the denominator of which is 24).\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf, prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Effective Time, Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company,\nParent or one of their respective affiliates without cause, by Mr. Sullivan for good reason or as a result of Mr.\nSullivan\u2019s death or disability, in accordance with the CEO Retention Agreement, all unpaid portions of the Retention\nPayment will be paid to Mr. Sullivan by the Company as soon as practicable but no later than the earlier of (x) 55 days\nafter the date of such termination and (y) the second regular payroll date following the Effective Date.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination without cause or for good reason, a condition precedent\nto the Company\u2019s obligation to pay any portion of the Retention Payment that relates to a Retention Date that has\nnot yet occurred as of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s termination date shall be Mr. Sullivan\u2019s execution and delivery of a release of\nclaims and compliance with his non-solicitation obligation described above.\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Davies\nPursuant to his employment agreement with us, in the event that Mr. Davies\u2019 employment terminates other than for\ncause, death or disability or Mr. Davies resigns for good reason, in each case, within six months following the\nEffective Time, he would be entitled to the severance payments and benefits listed below:\n\u2022\nContinued payment of his annual base salary for 12 months and payment of his target annual bonus (over\nthe same 12-month period) as then in effect or, if greater, as in effect

payment by the Company of the health continuation coverage premiums for Mr. Davies and his\neligible dependents for 12 months following the termination (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Davies and his\neligible dependents become covered under similar plans).\nMr. Davies\u2019 receipt of the foregoing severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon Mr. Davies (i) signing and\nnot revoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and (ii) complying with certain restrictive covenants,\nincluding a noncompetition covenant (for the duration of the severance period) and an 18-month employee non-\nsolicitation covenant.\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Noll\nPursuant to his employment agreement with us, Mr. Noll would be entitled to the following severance payments and\nbenefits in the event that Mr. Noll\u2019s employment terminates other than for cause, death or disability or if he resigns\nfor good reason, in each case, within six months following the Effective Time, he would be entitled to the severance\npayments and benefits listed below:\n\u2022\nContinued payment of his annual base salary for 12 months and payment of a target annual bonus (paid\nover the same 12-month period) as then in effect or, if greater, as in effect immediately prior to our entering\ninto the Merger Agreement, payable on the Company\u2019s normal payroll dates commencing within 70 days\nfollowing such termination\u037e and\n\u2022\nContinued payment by the Company of the health continuation coverage premiums for Mr. Noll and his\neligible dependents for six months following the termination (or, if earlier, the date that Mr. Noll and his\neligible dependents become covered under similar plans).\nMr. Noll\u2019s receipt of the foregoing severance payments and benefits is conditioned upon Mr. Noll (i) signing and not\nrevoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and (ii) complying with certain restrictive covenants, including a\nnoncompetition covenant (for the duration of the severance period) and an 18-month employee non-solicitation\ncovenant.\nPart-Time Employment Agreement with Dr. Chung\nDr. Chung\u2019s full-time employment agreement with us was terminated on April 1, 2022 due to his retirement. In\nconnection with his retirement, he entered into a part-time employment agreement with us effective April 2, 2022,\nwhich does not provide for any benefits in connection with his termination of employment or a change of control,\nexcept as described in the following sentence. However, pursuant to Dr. Chung\u2019s part-time employment agreement,\nthe equity-based awards that he held on April 1, 2022 remained outstanding and will continue to vest based on his\nservice and, if outstanding at the Effective Time, will be treated in accordance with the Merger Agreement.\n59\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nInternal Revenue Code Section 280G\nThe Employment Agreements with Messrs. Sullivan, Davies and Noll provide that the payments and benefits that the\napplicable executive officer otherwise would receive in connection with a change of control will be reduced to the\nextent necessary to avoid imposition of the \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax pursuant to Section 280G of the Internal\nRevenue Code, but only if such reduction would result in such executive officer retaining a greater amount of such\npayments and benefits on a net after-tax basis than had no reduction been made.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or\notherwise relates to the Merger or that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger. Please see \u201cTreatment of Natus Equity-Based Awards\u201d and \u201cPayments Upon\nTermination in Connection with Change of Control\u201d for further information regarding this compensation.\nThe amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for\nthe purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on June 30, 2022, and with respect to the cash payments\nand perquisite/benefit amounts, that the employment of each of the named executive officers is subject to an\ninvoluntary termination without \u201ccause\u201d, or the named executive officer resigns with \u201cgood reason\u201d, on such date.\nNatus\u2019 named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation enhancements, tax\nreimbursements or other benefits in connection with the Merger. However, we intend to terminate our nonqualified\ndeferred compensation plan prior to the Effective Time, in which case deferrals under the plan will cease and each\nnamed executive officer (as well as each other participant) who has an account balance under such plan would\nreceive accelerated payment of such balance (which is fully vested regardless of the Merger) promptly following the\nEffective Time.\nSome of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger (i.e.\nwithout regard to whether a termination of employment occurs). In addition to the assumptions regarding the\nconsummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other\nassumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to\nbe received by named executive officers in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.",

This amount represents the sum\nof (x) in the case of Company Options, an amount equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per\nshare attributable to such Company Option), multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are\nissuable upon the full exercise of such Company Option\u037e (y) in the case of Company Restricted Stock Units, an amount equal to\n(i) the amount of the Per Share Price\u037e multiplied by (ii) (1) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject\nto time-vesting requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock\nUnit, and (2) with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements,\nthe total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be performance vested with the performance goals deemed\nachieved at maximum levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied (except with respect to Mr.\nSullivan) and (z) in the case of each share of Company Restricted Stock, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Price. For Mr.\nSullivan, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the CEO Retention Agreement, the amount reflects Mr. Sullivan\u2019s MSUs deemed\nattained at the level of performance actually achieved through the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately\n143.4% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs\ngranted to Mr. Sullivan in January 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company\u2019s stockholders\u037e furthermore,\npursuant to the Merger Agreement and the CEO Retention Agreement, the amount otherwise payable in respect of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s\nCompany Restricted Stock Units has been reduced in the table above by an amount equal to the $6,000,000 Retention Payment.\nThe Retention Payment would otherwise have been payable to Mr. Sullivan at the Effective Time in respect of his Company\nRestricted Stock Units but will not become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, will become payable 50% on the six-\nmonth anniversary of the Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued employment\nwith the Company until the relevant retention date (except as described in Note (1) above).\n(3)\nThis amount equals the estimated value of the \u201cdouble trigger\u201d health insurance benefits to which each named executive officer\nmay become entitled to under his or her employment agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cInterests of Natus\u2019 Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger - Payments Upon Termination in Connection with Change of\nControl.\u201d For Mr. Sullivan, the amount above represents the cost of continuation of the level of group health coverage currently\nprovided by the Company to him and his eligible dependents until the third December 31st from the effective date of such\ntermination.

This amount includes the funds needed to: (1) pay stockholders the amounts due under\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e (2) make payments in respect of our outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement\u037e and (3) pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger\nAgreement.\nAlthough the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing\ncondition, the Merger Agreement provides that, in no event, will the Closing of the Merger occur before June 16,\n2022.\nEquity Financing\nPursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), Med Platform II has\nagreed to provide Parent with an equity commitment of up to approximately $840,000,000 in cash, which will be\navailable to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and\navailable to fund the aggregate purchase price and the other payments contemplated by, and subject to the terms and\nconditions of, the Merger Agreement.\nThe Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that: (1) Natus is an express third party beneficiary\nthereof in connection with Natus\u2019 exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the Merger Agreement\u037e\nand (2) Natus will be entitled to specific performance in connection with the exercise of such third party beneficiary\nrights.

        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL are met, Natus\nstockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand an appraisal\nof their shares of Company Common Stock, who continuously hold such shares of Company Common Stock from the\ndate of demand through the Effective Time of the Merger and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section\n262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL\n(\u201cSection 262\u201d). Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a\n\u201cstockholder\u201d are to a record holder of Company Common Stock.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other\nadvice and does not constitute a recommendation that Natus stockholders exercise their\n64TABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to\ndemand appraisal rights for the shares of Company Common Stock registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having\na beneficial interest in shares of Company Common Stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a\nbank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder\u2019s\nshares. If you hold your shares of Company Common Stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to\nexercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure that appraisal\nrights are exercised.\nUnder Section 262, holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock who (1) deliver a written demand for\nappraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of Company Common Stock to Natus prior to the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (3) continuously are the\nrecord holders of such shares of Company Common Stock from the date of demand through the Effective Time\u037e and\n(4) otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of Company\nCommon Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal\nproceedings as to all Natus stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares of\nCompany Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock\neligible for appraisal\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million\n(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its\ndiscretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound\nquarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the\nDelaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to\neach stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such\npayment only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d determined by the\nCourt of Chancery, and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.\nThe Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of\njudgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholder meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of\nrecord as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a\ncopy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Natus\u2019 notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available\nin connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In\nconnection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly\ncomply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights\nunder the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Price\nwithout interest. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of\nshares of Company Common Stock, Natus believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that\nstockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock must do\nALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Natus a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger\nAgreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Company Common Stock from the date of making the\ndemand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the\nshares of Company Common Stock before the Effective Time).\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock.\nFiling Written Demand\nA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Natus, before the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will\nbe submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of Company\nCommon Stock, and that stockholder must not vote, in person (virtually) or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of Company Common\nStock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of Company\nCommon Stock of record through the Effective Time. Neither voting (in person (virtually) or by proxy) against the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.\nThe written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Company Common Stock should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Natus of the identity of the holder and\nstate that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of Company Common\nStock. If the shares of Company Common Stock are owned of record in the name of another person, such as a broker,\nfiduciary, depositary or other nominee, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if\nsuch shares of Company Common Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and\ntenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including\nan authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e\nhowever, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand,\nthe agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If a stockholder holds shares of Company Common Stock\nthrough a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a\ndemand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the\ndepository nominee as record holder.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK\nACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD\nCONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL\nINTEREST IN SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER\nPERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD\nHOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nNatus Medical Incorporated\n3150 Pleasant View Road\nMiddleton, WI 53562\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAny holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered\npursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Natus a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However,\nany such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written\napproval of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nChancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e\nprovided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to\naccept the Per Share Price within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each\nrecord holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section\n262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective\nand the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or\nany holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal\nrights under Section 262 (or a beneficial owner in the circumstances described in the next paragraph) may commence\nan appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving\nCorporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares\nheld by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present\nintention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate\nany negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Company Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders of\nshares of Company Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to\nperfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Company Common Stock within the time and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days\nafter the Effective Time, stockholders\u2019 rights to appraisal shall cease, and all holders of shares of Company Common\nStock will be entitled to receive the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWithin one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock\nwho has complied with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be\nentitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate\nnumber of shares of Company Common Stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with\nrespect to which Natus has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares of\nCompany Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder within\nten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Company Common\nStock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above,\nhowever, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock and a copy thereof is\nserved upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days\nafter such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock and with\nwhom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required\nby the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders who\nhave complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of Company Common Stock to\nsubmit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may\ndismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.\nPursuant to Section 262(g), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Natus\nstockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to\nappraisal exceeds 1% of Natus\u2019 outstanding shares of Company Common Stock eligible for appraisal\u037e or (2) the value\nof the aggregate Per Share Price in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDetermination of Fair Value\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the\nCourt of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Company Common Stock, exclusive of\nany element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to\nbe paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly\nand will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to\ntime during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving\nCorporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the Surviving Corporation\nmakes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the\nsum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in such voluntary cash\npayment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued\nbefore such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of\nDelaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating\nthat \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial\ncommunity and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires\nconsideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in\nmaking this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings\nprospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that\nthrow any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v Technicolor,\nInc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass\nknown elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements\nof future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nmerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive\npursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking\nfirm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to,\nand may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. No representation is made as to the\noutcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should\nrecognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nPer Share Price. Neither Natus nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Price to any stockholder\nexercising appraisal rights, and each of Natus and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262,\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Company Common Stock is less than the Per Share Price. The costs of the appraisal\nproceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under\nthe circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of\nall the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or\nassessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 fails\nto perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Company\nCommon Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share\nPrice as provided in the Merger Agreement.\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such\nshares of Company Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the\nstock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the\nEffective Time).\n Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to\nconsult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

Instead, Mr. Sullivan\u2019s MSUs will be deemed attained at the level of performance actually achieved\nthrough the Closing based on the Per Share Price (which is approximately 143.4% of target, in the case of MSUs\ngranted to Mr. Sullivan in December 2021, and 139.6% of target, in the case of MSUs granted to Mr. Sullivan in\nJanuary 2022), consistent with the level of return to the Company\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nThe consequence to Mr. Sullivan will be a reduction by over $3,000,000 in the amount of gross proceeds that he\notherwise was entitled to receive and would have received in respect of his MSUs.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the CEO Retention Agreement, Mr. Sullivan agreed that an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the\n\u201cRetention Payment\u201d) payable to him at the Effective Time in respect of his Company Restricted Stock Units would\nnot become payable at the Effective Time and, instead, would become payable 50% on the six-month anniversary of\nthe Closing and 50% on the one-year anniversary of the Closing, subject to his continued employment with the\nCompany until the relevant retention date. If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company without cause,\nby Mr. Sullivan with good reason, or due to his death or disability, any then-unpaid portion of the Retention Payment\nshall be paid to him upon his termination (subject to, in the case of a termination by the Company without cause or\nby Mr. Sullivan for good reason, his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims). If Mr. Sullivan\u2019s\nemployment terminates for any other reason prior to the relevant retention date, he will immediately forfeit all portions\nof the Retention Payment that relate to a future retention date. Mr. Sullivan\u2019s right to receive the Retention Payment is\nfurther subject to his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants.",

redacted with respect thereto may be redacted)\u037e\n\u2022\nprior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, Natus and its\nRepresentatives, during the four Business Day notice period describe above, has negotiated with Parent\nand its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such\nadjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (which, if accepted by the Company\nwould be binding on Parent and Merger Sub) so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute\na Superior Proposal\u037e provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition\nProposal, the Company will be required to provide Parent with new written notice (but the four Business\nDay period shall instead be a two Business Day period) and otherwise comply with the requirements\ndescribed above\u037e\n\u2022\nin the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit Natus or any of its\nSubsidiaries to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, Natus has\nvalidly terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with the

to changes in the price of the shares of Company Common Stock, in and of itself (however,\nthe underlying reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event), (iii) relating to the fact that, in and of\nitself, the Company exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of the Company\u2019s\nrevenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period (provided, that the\nunderlying reasons for the Company exceeding such projections, estimates or expectations may constitute an\nIntervening Event) or (iv) relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates, if the Company Board determines in good faith\n(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably be expected to

all actions necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the\nbylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record date (and Natus will not change such record date without the\nprior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, condition or delayed), (ii) duly call\nand give notice of, the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practical following the signing of\nthe Merger Agreement, and (iii) convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably\npracticable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining\nthe Requisite Stockholder Approval. Natus will not be required to convene and hold the Company Stockholder\nMeeting at any time prior to the 20th Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company\nStockholders. Unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, Natus will use its reasonable best\nefforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, nothing will prevent Natus from\npostponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies\nif (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented by\nproxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum or to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval\nat the Company Stockholder Meeting (provided that, without Parent\u2019s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably\nwithheld, delayed or conditioned), the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting\nmore than two times pursuant to this clause (i) and no such postponement or adjournment shall be, without the prior\nwritten consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Parent, for a period exceeding 15\nBusiness Days)\u037e (ii) Natus is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law,\norder or a request from the SEC or its staff\u037e or (iii) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after\nconsultation with outside legal counsel) that it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary\nduties not to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to give the Company\nStockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that Natus has sent to the Company\nStockholders or otherwise made publicly available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with a\nCompany Board Recommendation Change).

        "Section Text": "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nThe following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to \u201cU.S. Holders\u201d and \u201cNon-U.S.\nHolders\u201d (in each case, as defined below) of Company Common Stock. This discussion applies only to holders that\nhold their Company Common Stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended, or the \u201cCode\u201d (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not describe\nall of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder\u2019s particular circumstances or to\nholders subject to special rules, such as:\n\u2022\nDealers or traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to Company Common\nStock\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons holding Company Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion\ntransaction, integrated transaction or constructive sale transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\nPartnerships or other entities classified as partnerships or pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes\u037e\n\u2022\nPersons who acquired Company Common Stock through the exercise of employee stock options or\notherwise as compensation\u037e\n\u2022\nCertain financial institutions and insurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nRegulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022\nReal estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nCertain former citizens or residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nTax-exempt entities, including an \u201cindividual retirement account\u201d or \u201cRoth IRA\u037e\u201d or\n\u2022\nPersons subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company Common Stock, the\nU.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the\npartnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Partnerships holding Company Common Stock and\npartners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger to them.\nThis discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary\nTreasury regulations, all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax\nconsiderations under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed.\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that is:\n\u2022\nA citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nA corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e or\n\u2022\nAn estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nThe exchange of Company Common Stock for cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder whose shares of Company Common Stock are converted into the right to\nreceive cash in the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal\nto the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. Holder\npaid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company Common Stock\n(i.e., shares of Company Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally\nwill be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of Company\n100TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommon Stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-\ncorporate U.S. Holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of\ncapital losses is subject to limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject\nto a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nA \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. Payments made to a Non-U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Company Common\nStock pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nThe gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the Non-U.S. Holder in\nthe United States (and if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the Non-U.S.\nHolder\u2019s permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States)\u037e\n\u2022\nThe Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger and certain\nother conditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nThe Non-U.S. Holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than\n5% of the Company Common Stock at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger, and\nNatus is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that the\nNon-U.S. Holder held Company Common Stock.\nA Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to regular U.S. federal income\ntax on any gain realized as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder. If such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation,\nit may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits (or a lower\ntreaty rate). A Non-U.S. Holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate\nof 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses\nrecognized in the same taxable year, even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.\nNatus believes that it is not, and has never been, a United States real property holding corporation.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments made in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock generally will be subject to information reporting\n(unless the holder is an \u201cexempt recipient\u201d) and may also be subject to backup withholding. To avoid backup\nwithholding, U.S. Holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal Revenue\nService Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. Holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is\ncorrect and such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding. A Non-U.S. Holder that provides the applicable\nwithholding agent with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will\ngenerally establish an exemption from backup withholding.\nAmounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited\nagainst a holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the Internal\nRevenue Service.\nYou are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your\nparticular circumstances as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or\nunder the laws of any state, local or foreign tax laws.\n101\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

With respect to the financial forecasts supplied to us by the Company (including without limitation\nthe financial forecasts contained in the Company Strategic Plan and the price to be received for certain assets (the\n\u201cSpecified Assets\u201d) assumed to be divested in the Company Strategic Plan), we have assumed, at the direction of the\nCompany, that they were reasonably prepared on the basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of the management of the Company as to the future operating and financial performance of the Company\nand that they provided a reasonable basis upon which we could form our opinion. Such forecasts and projections\nwere not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure. All such forecasted or projected financial information is\nbased on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors\nrelated to general economic and competitive conditions, including, without limitation, assumptions regarding the\nwidespread disruption, extraordinary uncertainty and unusual volatility arising from the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such\nforecasted or projected financial information. Stifel has relied on this forecasted or projected information, including\nwithout limitation estimates of the management of the Company of the price to be received for the Specified Assets,\nwithout independent verification or analyses and does not in any respect assume any responsibility for the accuracy\nor completeness thereof. Stifel expresses no opinion as to any such forecasted or projected information or any other\nestimates or the assumptions on which they were made.\nWe also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of\noperations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of the last financial information made available to\nus. We did not make or obtain any independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the Company\u2019s assets\nor liabilities, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Estimates of values of companies and\nassets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be\nsold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, Stifel assumes no responsibility for their accuracy.\nWe have assumed that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the Draft Merger Agreement.\nWe have also assumed that the Merger will be consummated substantially on the terms and conditions described in\nthe Merger Agreement without any waiver of material terms or conditions by the Company or any other party and\nwithout any anti-dilution or other adjustment to the Merger Consideration, and that obtaining any necessary\nregulatory approvals or satisfying any other conditions for consummation of the Merger will not have an adverse\neffect on the Company or the Merger. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a manner that\ncomplies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further assumed\nthat the Company has relied upon the advice of its counsel, independent accountants and other advisors (other than\nStifel) as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to the Company, the\nMerger and the Merger Agreement.\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of Directors - Natus Medical Incorporated \nApril 17, 2022 \nPage 3\nOur Opinion is limited to whether the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of Shares (other than Excluded\nShares), from a financial point of view, and does not address any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger\nincluding, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any consequences of the Merger on the Company,\nits stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects or implications of any voting, support, stockholder or\nother agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Merger or\notherwise.

Furthermore, we are not expressing any opinion herein as to the prices, trading\nrange or volume at which the Company\u2019s securities will trade following public announcement of the Merger.\nOur Opinion is necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions as they exist, and on the\ninformation made available to us by or on behalf of the Company or its advisors, or information otherwise reviewed\nby Stifel, as of the date of this Opinion. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion\nreached in this Opinion and that Stifel does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this Opinion.\nFurther, as the Board is aware, the credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and\nwe express no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on the Company, the Parent or the Merger.\nOur Opinion is for the information of, and directed to, the Board for its information and assistance in connection with\nits consideration of the financial terms of the Merger. Our Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the\nBoard as to how the Board should vote or otherwise act on the Merger or any other matter or to any shareholder of\nthe Company as to how any such shareholder should act with respect to the Merger or any other matter, including\nwithout limitation how to vote at any shareholders\u2019 meeting at which the Merger is considered, or whether or not to\nenter into a voting, shareholders\u2019, or affiliates\u2019 agreement with respect to the Merger, or exercise any dissenters\u2019 or\nappraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder. In addition, the Opinion does not compare the relative\nmerits of the Merger with any other alternative transactions or business strategies which may have been available to\nthe Company and does not address the underlying business decision of the Board or the Company to proceed with\nor effect the Merger.\nWe are not legal, tax, regulatory or bankruptcy advisors. We have not considered any potential legislative or\nregulatory changes currently being considered or recently enacted by the United States Congress, the various\nfederal banking agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), or any other regulatory bodies, or\nany changes in accounting methods or generally accepted accounting principles that may be adopted by the SEC or\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or any changes in regulatory accounting principles that may be adopted\nby any or all of the federal banking agencies. Our Opinion is not a solvency opinion and does not in any way address\nthe solvency or financial condition of the Company or the Parent or any other party.\nStifel, as part of its investment banking services, is regularly engaged in the independent valuation of businesses and\nsecurities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and unlisted\nsecurities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. We have acted as financial\nadvisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of\nwhich is contingent upon the completion of the Merger (the \u201cAdvisory Fee\u201d). We have also acted as financial\nadvisor to the Board and will receive a fee upon the delivery of this Opinion that is not contingent upon\nconsummation of the Merger (the \u201cOpinion Fee\u201d), provided that such Opinion Fee is creditable against any Advisory\nFee. We will not receive any other significant payment or compensation contingent upon the successful\nconsummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of\nour engagement. There are no material relationships that existed during the two years prior to the date of this\nB-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard of Directors - Natus Medical Incorporated \nApril 17, 2022 \nPage 4\nOpinion or that are mutually understood to be contemplated in which any compensation was received or is intended\nto be received as a result of the relationship between Stifel and any party to the Merger. Stifel may seek to provide\ninvestment banking services to the Parent or its affiliates in the future, for which we would seek customary\ncompensation. In the ordinary course of business, Stifel and our clients may transact in the equity securities of the\nCompany and the Parent or its affiliates and may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.\nStifel\u2019s Fairness Opinion Committee has approved the issuance of this Opinion.
