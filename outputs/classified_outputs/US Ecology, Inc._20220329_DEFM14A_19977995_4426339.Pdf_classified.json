Backup withholding may apply to the cash\npayment made pursuant to the merger unless the US Ecology stockholder or other payee provides a\nvalid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures (generally, by\nproviding a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 or applicable successor\nform).\nEach US Ecology stockholder is urged to read the discussion in the section entitled \u201cProposal No. 1:\nThe Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 65 of this\nProxy Statement and to consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or\nnon-U.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the merger.\nNo Shop\u037e Takeover Proposals (page 75)\nExcept as permitted by the Merger Agreement, including under the Board\u2019s \u201cfiduciary out\u201d exception\n(as more fully described in the \u201cBoard Recommendation\u037e Change of Recommendation\u037e Fiduciary Exception\u201d\nsection of this Proxy Statement beginning on page 76), during the pre-closing period, US\n4 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEcology has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will (i) solicit, initiate, propose, induce\nthe making or submission of, or knowingly encourage or facilitate in any way any offer, inquiry or\nproposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal (as defined\nbelow) or (ii) continue, enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or\nnegotiations with any person (and their respective representatives) regarding any Takeover Proposal\n(or inquiries, offers or proposals or any other effort or attempt that could reasonably be expected to\nlead to a Takeover Proposal), provided that US Ecology may communicate with third parties in order\nto notify those parties of the existence of these contractual restrictions under the Merger Agreement.\nUS Ecology has also agreed that, after entering into the Merger Agreement, (i) it will not grant a\nwaiver, amendment or release (to the extent not automatically waived, amended or released upon the\nannouncement of, or entering into the Merger Agreement) any \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions of any contract\nto which US Ecology or any of its subsidiaries is a party relating to a Takeover Proposal, and (ii) it\nwill immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties\npreviously conducted with respect to any Takeover Proposal.\nRegulatory Clearances (page 68)\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot be completed until any applicable waiting period\nunder the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d)\nhas expired or been terminated.

condition\nrelating to required regulatory approvals (including under the HSR Act), the condition relating to\nwhether a law or injunction has been enacted by any governmental entity which enjoins the merger\nand/or the condition relating to the imposition of a Burdensome Condition, then Republic Services\nwill be required to reimburse US Ecology for 50% of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket\nexpenses incurred in connection with the merger up to $5,000,000 (i.e., Republic Services\u2019\nreimbursement shall not exceed $2,500,000).\nSpecific Performance (page 82)\nUS Ecology

You must\nfollow the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee in order for your shares to be voted. The\nability to submit voting instructions via telephone and Internet also will be offered to stockholders\nowning shares through certain brokers, banks and other nominees. If your shares are not registered in\nyour own name but are held through your broker, bank or other nominee and you plan to vote your\nshares via the Special Meeting website, www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ECOL2022SM, you\nshould contact your broker, bank or other nominee for further instructions on how to obtain a proxy and\na specific control number (as applicable). Please note that if you hold your shares through a broker,\nbank or other nominee, such nominee cannot vote your shares unless you have given your nominee\nspecific instructions as to how to vote. In order for your vote to be counted, please make sure that you\nsubmit your voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.\nWill my shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name or another form of record ownership be\ncombined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?\nNo. Because any shares of US Ecology common stock you may hold in street name will be deemed to be\nheld by a different stockholder of record than any shares of US Ecology common stock you hold of\nrecord, any shares of US Ecology common stock held in street name will not be combined for voting\npurposes with shares of US Ecology common stock you hold of record.\nSimilarly, if you own shares of US Ecology common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly\nwith your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign\nand return, a separate proxy card or separately submit a proxy by telephone or Internet with respect to\nthose shares of US Ecology common stock because they are held in a different form of record\nownership. Shares of US Ecology common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted\nby an authorized officer of the entity or its duly appointed proxy. Shares of US Ecology common stock\nheld in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing such account.\nWhat is the quorum requirement for the Special Meeting?\nA quorum is necessary to hold a valid meeting of US Ecology stockholders. The holders of a majority of\nthe outstanding shares of common stock on the Record Date entitled to vote at the Special Meeting\npresent in person (virtually) or by proxy will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the\nSpecial Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be\nadjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.\nIf you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on\nthe proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present\nat the Special Meeting.\nIf your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the\nnominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether\na quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting.\n21 \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, we expect to adjourn or postpone the\nSpecial Meeting until we solicit enough proxies to obtain a quorum.\nWhat happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?\nStockholder of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a signed proxy card or submit\nyour proxy by telephone or the Internet, but do not specify how you want to vote your shares on a\nparticular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with the\nrecommendations of the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. Thus, your shares of US\nEcology common stock will be voted:\n\u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation\u037e and\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nBeneficial Owner. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, under applicable stock\nexchange rules the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares may generally vote on routine\nproposals but cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters unless they have discretionary\nauthority. None of the proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are considered routine\nproposals. As a result, if the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares does not receive\ninstructions from you on how to vote your shares, no vote will be cast at the Special Meeting with\nrespect to such shares. Therefore, we urge you to give voting instructions to your broker. Shares that\nare held by a broker, bank or other nominee for which the beneficial owner provides no voting\ninstructions will not be counted as present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy in\ndetermining whether there is a quorum. The failure to provide voting instructions with respect to any\nshares that you beneficially own through a broker, bank or other nominee will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and, assuming that a quorum is present,\nwill have no effect on the adjournment proposal. Your abstention will have the same effect as a as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and, assuming that a quorum is present, will\nhave no effect on the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation or the\nadjournment proposal.\nWhat is the voting requirement to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?\nAdoption of the Merger Agreement requires stockholders holding a majority of the shares of US\nEcology common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled\nto vote thereon to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your\nshares of US Ecology common stock or an abstention from voting on this proposal will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in\nstreet name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote\nyour shares, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement.\nWhat is the voting requirement to approve the advisory proposal on merger-related compensation?\nAssuming that a quorum is present, the approval of the non-binding advisory proposal on merger-\nrelated compensation requires that a majority of the votes cast at the Special Meeting be cast \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadvisory proposal. Assuming that a quorum is present, an abstention from voting on the non-binding\nadvisory proposal on merger-related compensation will have no effect on the advisory proposal. If your\nshares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the\nnominee how to vote your shares, your failure to do so will have no effect on the non-binding advisory\nproposal on merger-related compensation assuming that a quorum is present.\nWhat is the voting requirement to approve the adjournment proposal?\nAssuming that a quorum is present, the approval of the adjournment proposal requires that a majority of\nthe votes cast at the Special Meeting be cast \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal. Assuming that a quorum\nis present, an abstention from voting on the adjournment proposal will have no effect on the\nadjournment proposal. If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and\n22 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nyou do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your failure to do so will have no effect on\nthe adjournment proposal assuming that a quorum is present.\nHow do US Ecology directors and executive officers intend to vote?\nWe currently expect that US Ecology directors and executive officers will vote their shares of US\nEcology common stock \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, \u201cFOR\u201d the non-binding\nadvisory proposal on merger-related compensation and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal, although they\nhave no obligation to do so.\nThe directors and executive officers of US Ecology may have interests in the merger that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, the interests of US Ecology stockholders generally. These interests are\ndescribed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cInterests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become\npayable by US Ecology to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nSEC rules require US Ecology to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or\nmay become payable by US Ecology to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.\nWhat effects will the merger have on US Ecology and US Ecology\u2019s common stock?\nUS Ecology common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is listed on Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market under the symbol \u201cECOL.\u201d At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and\ninto US Ecology, with US Ecology continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Republic Services. As a result of the merger, US Ecology cease to be a publicly traded\ncompany. Following the consummation of the merger, US Ecology common stock will be de-listed from\nNasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act.\nWhat effects will the merger have on US Ecology equity awards?\nAt the effective time, each US Ecology stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time and that has an exercise price per share that is less than $48.00, whether or not vested, will\nbecome fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive, promptly after the\neffective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax withholding\nrequirements) equal to the product of (i) the excess of $48.00 over the per-share exercise price of such\nUS Ecology stock option and (ii) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such US Ecology stock\noption. Each US Ecology stock option with an exercise price equal to or greater than $48.00 will be\ncancelled as of the effective time without payment of any consideration and will have no further force or\neffect.\nAt the effective time, each performance stock unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive,\npromptly after the effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax\nwithholding requirements) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares equal to the greater of (a) the\ntarget number of shares with respect to such performance stock unit award and (b) the number of shares\nthat would be considered earned under the terms of such performance stock unit award based on the\nmost recent fiscal year-end results multiplied by (ii) $48.00.\nAt the effective time, each restricted share unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive,\npromptly after the effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax\nwithholding requirements) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such restricted\nshare unit award and (ii) $48.00.\nFurther, at the effective time, each restricted share award that is outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time will become fully vested and will be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder to receive,\npromptly after the effective time, a cash payment (without interest and subject to all applicable tax\n23 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwithholding requirements) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such restricted\nshare award and (ii) $48.00.\nNo US Ecology equity awards have been granted to any director, executive officer or employee of US\nEcology between the date of the Merger Agreement and the date of this Proxy Statement.\nFor additional details on the treatment of US Ecology stock options, performance stock units, restricted\nshare awards and restricted stock units in the merger, please see the section entitled \u201cTreatment of US\nEcology Equity Awards in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.\nWhat effects will the merger have on US Ecology warrants?\nUS Ecology warrants are currently registered under the Exchange Act, and are listed on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market under the symbol \u201cECOLW.\u201d\u2007\u2007At the effective time, in accordance with the terms of\neach warrant issued pursuant to that certain Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to the Warrant\nAgreement between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, dated November 1,\n2019, Republic Services will cause the surviving corporation to issue a replacement warrant to each\nholder thereof that complies with and satisfies the applicable terms and conditions of the Warrant\nAgreement, providing that such replacement warrant shall be exercisable for an amount in cash, without\ninterest, determined in accordance with the Warrant Agreement.\nPursuant to the Warrant Agreement, if a holder of a warrant properly exercises such warrant within 30\ndays following the public disclosure of the consummation of the merger by US Ecology on Form 8-K,\nthe warrant price shall be reduced by an amount (in dollars) equal to the difference of the warrant price\nin effect immediately prior to the consummation of the merger ($58.67 as of the date of this Proxy\nStatement) minus (i) the difference of the merger consideration of $48.00 per share of US Ecology\ncommon stock and (ii) the \u201cBlack-Scholes warrant value\u201d as of immediately prior to the consummation of\nthe merger. The Black-Scholes value of a warrant means the value of a warrant based on the Black-\nScholes Warrant Model for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg Financial Markets. In the event that\nthe merger is ultimately completed, the Company intends to announce the adjusted warrant price of the\nwarrants concurrently with its announcement of the consummation of the merger. The warrants may be\nexercised following the closing via cashless exercise.\nFollowing the consummation of the merger, US Ecology warrants will be de-listed from the Nasdaq\nCapital Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nWhen is the merger expected to be completed?\nTogether with Republic Services, we are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible\nafter the date of the Special Meeting, and currently expect to consummate the merger by the end of the\nsecond quarter. We cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the merger will be satisfied (or, to the\nextent permitted, waived). The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied\n(or, to the extent permitted, waived), including, among other things, the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by US Ecology stockholders.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by US Ecology stockholders, or if the merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, US Ecology stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of US\nEcology common stock in connection with the merger. Except in certain circumstances where US\nEcology has entered into an alternative transaction to the merger, US Ecology would remain a public\ncompany, and shares of US Ecology common stock would continue to be registered under the Exchange\nAct, as well as listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and US Ecology warrants would\ncontinue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain specified circumstances, the\nCompany termination fee will be due and payable by US Ecology to Republic Services. See the sections\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fee\u201d beginning\non page 80 of this Proxy Statement.\n24 \nQ: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCan I revoke my proxy or change my vote?\nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken\nat the Special Meeting by filing with the Secretary of the Company either an instrument revoking the\nproxy or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Special Meeting and voting\nthereat.\nPlease note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without\ntaking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you\nwant to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card or by sending a written notice of revocation to\nUS Ecology, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in\nsufficient time for it to be received by US Ecology before the Special Meeting (which new proxy cards or\nwritten notices of revocation should be received by or with our last mail delivery before the Special\nMeeting begins in order to ensure that they will be counted).\nIf you hold your shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow\nthe instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or\nsubmit new voting instructions. You may also revoke your proxy by obtaining further instructions from\nyour broker, bank or other nominee that holds the shares of record on how to obtain a proxy and\nspecific control number (as applicable) to vote your shares at the Special Meeting and voting your\nshares at the Special Meeting.\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nThe requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is based on the\ntotal number of shares of US Ecology common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date, not\njust the shares that are voted. Failure to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy by phone or the\nInternet or to vote via the Special Meeting website by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in\nstreet name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote\nyour shares, it will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement. For more information concerning the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the\nmerger, please review this Proxy Statement and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as Annex A.\nAssuming that a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast \u201cFOR\u201d each of\nthe non-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation and the adjournment proposal is\nrequired to approve such proposals. Assuming that a quorum is present, an abstention from voting will\nhave no effect on the advisory proposal or the adjournment proposal and, if your shares are held in\nstreet name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote\nyour shares, your failure to do so will have no effect on the advisory proposal or the adjournment\nproposal.\nOnly shares of US Ecology common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the close of business\non the record date are eligible to be voted on each of the three proposals and will be counted for\npurposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting.\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by US Ecology stockholders, the merger cannot close.\nIf the merger is consummated, how will I receive the cash for my shares of US Ecology common stock?\nIf the merger is consummated and your shares of US Ecology common stock are held in book-entry or in\nthe name of a broker, bank or other nominee, the cash proceeds will be deposited into your bank or\nbrokerage account without any further action on your part. If you hold your shares of US Ecology\ncommon stock in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to\nsurrender your certificates that previously represented shares of US Ecology common stock to the\npaying agent in connection with the merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check for\nyour shares of US Ecology common stock after you comply with such instructions. Employees of US\nEcology who hold outstanding US Ecology equity awards at the effective time will receive consideration\nfor those awards through payroll.\n25 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat happens if the market price of shares of US Ecology\u2019s common stock significantly changes before the\nclosing?\nRepublic Services is not obligated to change the merger consideration of $48.00 per share of US Ecology\ncommon stock as a result of a change in the market price of US Ecology\u2019s common stock.\nWhat happens if I sell my shares of US Ecology common stock before completion of the merger?\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of US Ecology common stock\nthrough completion of the merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of US Ecology common\nstock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger\nconsideration in the merger.\nThe record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is March 28, 2022. If you\ntransfer your shares of US Ecology common stock after the record date but before the closing, unless\nyou have granted a \u201clegal proxy\u201d to the purchaser as part of the transfer, you will have the right to vote\nat the Special Meeting, although you will have transferred your right to receive the merger\nconsideration in the merger.\nIn addition, if you demand appraisal for any of your shares and thereafter sell such shares, you will no\nlonger be entitled to appraisal rights with respect to such shares.\nShould I send in my evidence of ownership now?\nNo. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal, if applicable, and related\nmaterials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for surrendering the\ncertificates, if any, representing the shares of US Ecology common stock held by you prior to the\nconsummation of the merger for the merger consideration. If your shares of US Ecology common stock\nare held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your\nbroker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take in order to effect the surrender\nof your street name shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Please do not send in any\ndocumentation of evidence of ownership now.\nAm I entitled to exercise dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my\nshares of US Ecology common stock?\nYes. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, but only if they fully comply with all applicable requirements of the DGCL,\nwhich are summarized in this Proxy Statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be\nmore than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise\nappraisal rights for its shares must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to US\nEcology before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and such stockholder must not\nvote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement with respect to such\nshares. Failure to comply exactly with the procedures and requirements specified under the DGCL will\nresult in the loss of appraisal rights. The discussion of appraisal rights contained in this Proxy\nStatement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified\nin its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached as Annex D to this Proxy\nStatement. For additional information, please see the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on\npage 88 of this Proxy Statement. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if\nyou are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek the advice of your own\nlegal counsel.\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of US Ecology common stock for the merger\nconsideration pursuant to the merger?\nGenerally, yes, if you are a U.S. stockholder. The exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock for\nthe merger consideration pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Accordingly, an US Ecology stockholder that is a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d  (as defined in the section\n26 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nentitled \u201cProposal No. 1: The Merger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d\nbeginning on page 65 of this Proxy Statement) will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in the merger plus the\namount used to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes and (ii) such U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nthe shares of US Ecology common stock exchanged therefor. With respect to an US Ecology\nstockholder that is a \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d  (as defined in the section entitled \u201cProposal No. 1: The Merger\u202f-\u202f\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 65 of this Proxy\nStatement), the exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock for the merger consideration pursuant\nto the merger generally will not result in tax to such non-U.S. holder under U.S. federal income tax laws\nunless such non-U.S. holder has certain connections with the United States. Backup withholding may\napply to the cash payment made pursuant to the merger unless the US Ecology stockholder or other\npayee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures\n(generally, by providing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8 or applicable\nsuccessor form).\nEach US Ecology stockholder is urged to read the discussion in the section entitled \u201cProposal No. 1: The\nMerger\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 65 of this Proxy\nStatement and to consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-\nU.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the merger.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to\ndetermine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular\ncircumstances and any consequences arising under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or tax treaties.\nWhat does it mean if I get more than one proxy card?\nIf your shares of US Ecology common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one\naccount, you will receive more than one proxy or voting instruction form. Please complete and return all\nof the proxy cards or voting instructions forms you receive (or submit each of your proxies or voting\ninstructions forms by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares of\nUS Ecology common stock are voted.\nHow many copies should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder?\nSome banks, brokers and other nominees may participate in the practice of \u201chouseholding\u201d proxy\nstatements, annual reports and notices of Internet availability of proxy materials. This means that a\nsingle set of our proxy materials, containing a single copy of this Proxy Statement but multiple proxy\ncards or voting instruction forms, may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household.

US\nEcology has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated (which we refer to as \u201cInnisfree\u201d) as proxy advisor\nto assist in the solicitation of proxies for the US Ecology Special Meeting. US Ecology estimates that it\nwill pay the proxy advisor a fee of approximately $75,000, plus reimbursement of certain expenses. In\naddition, US Ecology may reimburse its transfer agent, brokerage firms and other persons representing\nbeneficial owners of shares of US Ecology common stock for their expenses in forwarding solicitation\nmaterial to such beneficial owners.\nAre there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?\nYes.

This summary does not purport to be\ncomplete and may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you. You are\nencouraged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety.\nThe Board unanimously recommends that stockholders approve the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, a copy of which is filed as Annex A to this Proxy Statement, which was approved by the Board\non February 8, 2022.\nCertain Effects of the Merger\u037e Merger Consideration\nIf the Merger Agreement is adopted by US Ecology stockholders and the other conditions to the closing of\nthe transactions contemplated the Merger Agreement (the \u201cclosing\u201d) are either satisfied or waived, Merger\nSub will merge with and into US Ecology, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and US\nEcology will continue as the surviving company in the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Republic\nServices (the \u201cmerger\u201d).\nUpon the consummation of the merger, each share of US Ecology common stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time, other than shares of US Ecology common stock (i) owned by Republic\nServices or US Ecology (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-\nowned subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (\u201ccancelled shares\u201d) or (ii) held\nby stockholders who will have neither voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented\nthereto in writing and who will have demanded and properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such\nshares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cdissenting shares\u201d and, together with the cancelled\nshares, the \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $48.00 in cash,\nwithout interest. At the effective time of the merger (the \u201ceffective time\u201d), US Ecology stockholders will cease\nto have ownership interests in US Ecology or rights as stockholders of US Ecology, except as provided in\nthe Merger Agreement or by law.\nUS Ecology common stock is currently registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cECOL.\u201d\nWarrants to purchase shares of US Ecology common stock are currently registered under the Exchange Act\nand are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (together with Nasdaq Global Select Market, \u201cNasdaq\u201d) under\nthe symbol \u201cECOLW.\u201d As a result of the merger, US Ecology will cease to be a publicly traded company and\nwill become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Republic Services. Following the consummation of the merger, US\nEcology common stock and warrants to purchase US Ecology common stock will be de-listed from Nasdaq\nand de-registered under the Exchange Act, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and\nregulations.\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by US Ecology stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for\nany other reason, US Ecology stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of US Ecology\ncommon stock in connection with the merger. Except in certain circumstances where US Ecology has entered\ninto an alternative transaction to the merger, US Ecology will remain a public company, and shares of US\nEcology common stock and warrants to purchase shares of US Ecology common stock will continue to be\nregistered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on Nasdaq.\nBackground of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThis chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Board of the\nCompany, the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s advisors, Republic Services, the Board of Directors of\nRepublic Services, Republic Services\u2019 management, Republic Services\u2019 advisors or any other person.\nThe Board and senior management of the Company regularly review and assess the Company\u2019s business\nstrategies and objectives, and the Board regularly discusses the Company\u2019s performance, risks and\n29 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nopportunities, all with the goal of enhancing stockholder value. As part of these ongoing efforts, the Board\nand the Company\u2019s senior management periodically evaluate various strategic alternatives, including the\ncontinued operation of the Company as an independent, standalone company, acquiring new businesses to\ncomplement or expand existing businesses, merging with or engaging in a strategic transaction with another\ncompany, negotiating a sale of the Company with an industry participant or financial sponsor, divesting one\nor more of the Company\u2019s businesses, reducing the Company\u2019s outstanding debt, and entering into strategic\npartnerships or other investments with respect to one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses. In considering\nall available alternatives, the Board and the Company\u2019s senior management take into account current and\npotential economic, political and social conditions and developments, trends in the industries in which the\nCompany operates, and any macro-level drivers of change and uncertainty (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)\nimpacting the public markets. In addition, the Company and its representatives have been approached\nperiodically by other companies and their representatives regarding potential interest in a material\ntransaction involving the Company.\nIn December 2019, an unprecedented new coronavirus disease, referred to as COVID-19, began spreading\naround the world. The virus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,\n2020 and a national emergency by the President of the United States on March 13, 2020, prompted\ngovernment authorities throughout the world to institute quarantines, travel restrictions, mandated business\nclosures, masking requirements, lockdown orders and other restrictions in an effort to contain its spread. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to it resulted in virtually unprecedented turbulence\nand uncertainty throughout the globe, impacting peoples\u2019 lives, health and safety as well as the economy\nand the financial markets. Like many other companies throughout the world, the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn order to address the market volatility and economic uncertainty induced by market conditions coinciding\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board determined to shore up its defenses against potential hostile third\nparty actors seeking to exploit the Company\u2019s temporarily depressed stock price, while also evaluating the\nviability of various strategic alternatives and the strength and health of the Company\u2019s corporate\ngovernance practices with a goal of maximizing stockholder value. As a result of these efforts, the Board\nwould ultimately adopt and recommend that its stockholders adopt a number of modifications to the\nCompany\u2019s organizational documents, as described in greater detail below. As part of that effort, on August\n24, 2020, the Company engaged Houlihan Lokey to serve as the Company\u2019s exclusive financial advisor in\nconnection with various matters relating to stockholder activism, including any demand, whether publicly or\nprivately, for changes in the Company\u2019s strategy, governance, Board composition or management team.\nMeanwhile, the Company began to receive inbound indications of interest from potential transaction\ncounterparties: On December 11, 2020, Party A delivered an unsolicited letter expressing an interest in\nacquiring 100% of the Company\u2019s common stock at a value of $46.60 per share, and on December 14, 2020,\nParty B delivered an unsolicited letter expressing an interest in acquiring 100% of the Company\u2019s common\nstock at a value range of $44.00-$46.00 per share. The proposals from both Party A and Party B were subject\nto a number of conditions, including, in each case, the satisfactory completion of due diligence on the\nCompany, the negotiation of mutually agreeable definitive transaction documentation, approval by the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders, and the receipt of any required antitrust and other regulatory approvals. The\nclosing price of the Company\u2019s common stock was $36.20 as of December 11, 2020 and $36.63 as of December\n14, 2020.\nIn light of the inbound inquiries the Company had received regarding a potential strategic transaction, the\nCompany engaged both Houlihan Lokey and Barclays, to provide financial advisory services in connection\nwith any such strategic transaction, including, in each case and if requested by the Company, the delivery\nby Barclays or Houlihan Lokey (as applicable) of an opinion to the Board with respect to the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, to the Company\u2019s stockholders of the consideration to be offered in a particular\nstrategic transaction to such stockholders.\nOn January 15, 2021, the Board and senior management met and heard a presentation from Dechert LLP\n(\u201cDechert\u201d), the Company\u2019s legal advisors, regarding the application of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under\napplicable law in connection with various potential transaction types. In addition, representatives of\nBarclays and Houlihan Lokey reviewed with the Board a preliminary financial analysis of the Company. The\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBoard, senior management, and the Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors also discussed the Company\u2019s\nintrinsic value, historical stock performance and long-term value considerations as well as potential\nprotective measures which the Company could put in place to minimize the possibility that hostile actors\ncould successfully exploit the Company\u2019s depressed stock price during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following\nthese presentations, the Board adopted amendments to the Company\u2019s bylaws which included provisions\nrequiring advance notice of director nominations and that certain disputes be litigated in an exclusive forum.\nFinally, the Board, senior management, and the Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors discussed the offers\nfrom Party A and Party B. The independent directors on the Board also met separately in executive session\nto discuss, among other things, the Company\u2019s intrinsic value as an independent, standalone company as\ncompared to the offers from Party A and Party B. Following extensive deliberation on the merits of each of\nthese offers, the Board concluded that neither offer was sufficient to serve as the basis for further\nnegotiations. Company management informed Party A and Party B of this determination, and neither Party A\nnor Party B pursued the matter further at that time.\nOn February 24, 2021, Party C, an activist stockholder, informed the Company that it had become a\nsignificant stockholder of the Company. Following discussions with Party C, the Company arranged for Party\nC to meet virtually with its Chief Financial Officer on March 9, 2021 and to meet virtually with its Chief\nExecutive Officer on April 13, 2021.\nOn April 13, 2021, the Company filed its definitive proxy statement with respect to the Company\u2019s 2021\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon its\nconsideration of the advantages and disadvantages of such course of action following consultations with\nthe Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors, the Company proposed in its proxy statement a number of\npotential protective measures which the Company recommended putting in place to minimize the possibility\nthat hostile actors could successfully exploit the Company\u2019s depressed stock price as well as additional\nchanges to improve the Company\u2019s corporate governance policies and practices. Specifically, among other\nthings, the Company proposed to further amend its organizational documents to eliminate cumulative voting\nin director elections, to adopt a plurality voting standard for contested director elections and to establish a\nproxy access bylaw. At the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 25, 2021, the Company\u2019s\nstockholders approved each of these proposals.\nOn July 23, 2021, Party C sent a private letter to the Company\u2019s Board and Chief Executive Officer, outlining\nits investment thesis regarding the Company and expressing concern regarding the underperformance of the\nCompany\u2019s stock relative to other companies in the same industries and the Company\u2019s capital allocation\ndecisions. Party C requested additional meetings with the Company\u2019s independent directors on the Board to\nfurther discuss their concerns. The Company arranged for Party C to meet virtually with two of its\nindependent directors on August 16, 2021 and again virtually on September 13, 2021. During these meetings\nParty C outlined its investment thesis for the Company. In particular, in its communications with the\nCompany, Party C expressed its opinion that the Company\u2019s capital allocation history was questionable and,\nmore specifically, that the Company overpaid for its acquisition of NRC Group Holdings Corp. in November\n2019. In these communications, Party C expressed its opinion that the Board should consider exploring\nstrategic alternatives.\nOn August 31, 2021, Party D\u2019s Executive Chairman and the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer held a\ndiscussion during which Party D disclosed receiving an unsolicited inbound communication from Party C\npresenting Party C\u2019s investment thesis on the Company and inquiring if Party D would have any interest in\npursuing an acquisition of the Company. In this discussion, Party D indicated to the Company\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer that Party D would not have interest in pursuing a transaction with the Company.\nOn September 7, 2021, Party B and the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer met to discuss current industry\ntrends and business challenges. During this discussion, Party B expressed continued interest in pursuing a\ntransaction with the Company, but noted that Party B would likely need to pay a significant portion of the\ntransaction consideration using its stock instead of cash, given Party B\u2019s recent announcement of another\ntransaction.\nOn October 7, 2021, Party C sent a private letter to the Board again criticizing the Company\u2019s long-term stock\nprice performance and capital allocation policies, in particular the Board\u2019s decision to acquire NRC\n31 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGroup Holdings Corp. in November 2019. In its letter, Party C requested that the Board initiate an immediate\nsale process or, alternatively, suggested that members of the Company\u2019s senior leadership team should be\nreplaced.\nOn October 22, 2021, the Chief Development Officer of Republic Services contacted one of the Company\u2019s\nindependent directors to inquire who Republic Services should contact to initiate a discussion regarding\nexploring a strategic transaction. Following this outreach, on October 23, 2021, the respective Chief\nExecutive Officers of the Company and Republic Services discussed, among other things, an overview of the\nCompany\u2019s businesses, as well as the possible synergies that could result from an acquisition of the\nCompany by Republic Services. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer then communicated the content of\nthe discussion to the Board by email on October 23, 2021.\nOn October 26, 2021, the respective Chief Executive Officers of the Company and Republic Services\ndiscussed Republic Services\u2019 continued interest in a potential transaction involving the Company and the\nCompany\u2019s Chief Executive Officer suggested that Republic Services submit an offer in writing.\nAlso on October 26, 2021, Party A contacted the Company again and reiterated its interest in a potential\ntransaction involving the Company.\nOn November 3, 2021, Republic Services\u2019 Chief Executive Officer contacted the Company\u2019s Chief Executive\nOfficer and submitted a verbal proposal, which was then submitted in writing on the same day, to acquire\n100% of the Company\u2019s common stock at a value of between $40.00 and $42.00 per share on an all-cash\nbasis. The closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock as of November 3, 2021 was $32.82. The letter\nprovided that Republic Services\u2019 offer was subject to due diligence and negotiation of a definitive\nagreement.\nOn November 10, 2021 and November 11, 2021, the Board convened a regular meeting to discuss, in addition\nto the Board\u2019s regular business, the status of the Company\u2019s review of strategic alternatives to date,\nincluding the Company\u2019s strategic plan and the offers and indications of interest the Company had received.\nIn order to prepare for considering potential strategic alternatives, the Board heard an updated presentation\nfrom Dechert regarding the application of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law in connection with\nvarious potential transactions. In addition, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey reviewed with\nthe Board an updated preliminary financial analysis of the Company. The Board and its legal and financial\nadvisors then discussed various strategic alternatives under consideration, including the future prospects of\nthe Company on a standalone basis, and the risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives. Upon\nthe conclusion of this meeting, the Board authorized senior management to continue preliminary discussions\nwith Republic Services and other prospective counterparties regarding a potential strategic transaction with\nthe Company. However, after this meeting and at the direction of the Board, Company management expressed\nto Republic Services on November 15, 2021 its view that, while Republic Services\u2019 offer price range\nrepresented a premium to the current market value of the Company\u2019s common stock, it nevertheless\nrepresented a discount to the Company\u2019s intrinsic value, and that Republic Services would need to increase\nits offer price significantly in order for the Company to seriously entertain Republic Services\u2019 offer.\nOn November 16, 2021, the Company had an introductory meeting with Party E, another party which had\nexpressed an interest in a potential transaction with the Company, to provide an overview of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness.\nOn November 19, 2021, Party E expressed an interest in acquiring 100% of the Company\u2019s common stock at a\nvalue of between $48.00 to $56.00 per share. The closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock as of\nNovember 19, 2021 was $34.98. The proposal from Party E was subject to a number of conditions, including\nthe satisfactory completion of due diligence on the Company and the negotiation of mutually agreeable\ndefinitive transaction documentation. Party E also requested a three-week period of limited exclusivity during\nwhich the Company could still engage with prospective counterparties who made unsolicited offers\nregarding a potential strategic transaction. The letter from Party E stated that Party E could complete its due\ndiligence expeditiously with limited time commitment from management and provide a firm offer by December\n15, 2021. On November 23, 2021, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer met with Party E to obtain\nclarifications about Party E\u2019s proposal, including Party E\u2019s expectations surrounding financing, exclusivity,\nand the level of due diligence that was expected to be required.\n32 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 29, 2021, following the initial discussions with Party E, the Board met and discussed Party E\u2019s\nindication of interest. The Board authorized management to negotiate a nondisclosure agreement with Party\nE, but only on a non-exclusive basis. At this meeting of the Board, the Board also established a transaction\ncommittee to oversee the Company\u2019s exploration of potential strategic alternatives, including, but not limited\nto, a potential transaction with Republic Services, Party E or any other interested party. The transaction\ncommittee (\u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) was comprised of Daniel Fox, Richard Burke, Katina Dorton, and Glenn\nA. Eisenburg, with Richard Burke as chairman, and the goal of the Transaction Committee was to allow the\nBoard to expeditiously and efficiently explore a potential merger or sale of, or other strategic transaction\ninvolving, the Company, to keep the Board fully informed and ultimately make a recommendation regarding\nany such transaction to the full Board. At this meeting representatives of Dechert also made a preliminary\nreport to the Board on their views of the potential antitrust risks that would arise in attempting to complete a\ntransaction with various proposed counterparties, including Republic Services, Party A, Party B and Party E.\nIn light of the status of its exploration of strategic alternatives to date, on November 30, 2021, the Company\nagreed to extend the term of its engagement of Houlihan Lokey. The Company would likewise agree to extend\nthe term of its engagement of Barclays on January 10, 2022.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer had a call with a representative of Party E to\ndiscuss Party E\u2019s indication of interest. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer confirmed that the Company\nwas willing to engage in discussions about a potential transaction at the value range set forth in Party E\u2019s\nindication of interest but that the Company would not entertain exclusivity at that time.\nAlso on December 1, 2021, representatives of Dechert sent to Party E a draft nondisclosure agreement, which\nthe Company and Party E negotiated until its execution on December 8, 2021. Among other things the\nnondisclosure agreement contained a standstill provision in favor of the Company for one year which would\nfall away upon the announcement by the Company of the Company\u2019s entry into a definitive agreement with\nrespect to a strategic transaction with a party other than Party E.\nOn December 2, 2021, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey had initial conversations with\nrepresentatives of Party E on behalf of the Company.\nOn December 3, 2021, Republic Services\u2019 Chief Development Officer reached out to one of the Company\u2019s\nindependent directors seeking more clarity on how Republic Services and the Company could potentially\nmove forward towards a negotiated transaction. In response, on December 8, 2021, the Company\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer contacted Republic Services\u2019 Chief Development Officer and expressed the view that, based\non prior discussions with the Board, Republic Services would need to increase the valuation range stated in\nRepublic Services\u2019 November 3, 2021 offer to a price of $50.00 per share or more in order for the Company to\nseriously entertain Republic Services\u2019 offer.\nOn December 9, 2021, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey sent a proposed nondisclosure\nagreement on behalf of the Company to Republic Services\u2019 Chief Development Officer.\nOn December 10, 2021, financial advisors for Republic Services and the Company discussed a potential\ntransaction.\nBetween December 11, 2021 and December 21, 2021, members of the Company\u2019s senior management, at the\ndirection of the Transaction Committee, engaged in multiple discussions with Party E regarding a potential\ntransaction with the Company, exchanging information and answering numerous diligence requests made by\nParty E.\nOn December 17, 2021, Republic Services submitted a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock at an increased valuation of $51.00 per share on an all-cash basis. The closing price of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock as of December 17, 2021 was $30.68. The proposal from Republic Services was\nsubject to a number of conditions, including the satisfactory completion of due diligence on the Company\nand the negotiation of mutually agreeable definitive transaction documentation, though Republic Services\nspecifically indicated that no financing condition would be required. Republic Services also requested an\neight-week period of exclusivity. Furthermore, Republic Services\u2019 letter noted that, while Republic Services\npreferred a collaborative, consensual transaction, Republic Services reserved the right to\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npursue all necessary steps to ensure that the Company\u2019s stockholders were provided with the opportunity to\nrealize the value inherent in Republic Services\u2019 revised proposal.\nOn December 17, 2021, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the current progress of negotiations with\nParty E and the revised proposal from Republic Services. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer reported to\nthe Transaction Committee that Party E needed to review and understand additional due diligence\ninformation in order to provide a firm offer. The Transaction Committee also reviewed the Company\u2019s\nfinancial projections.\nOn December 21, 2021, the full Board met to discuss the remaining counterparties interested in a potential\ntransaction with the Company, the financial projections for the Company\u2019s future outlook on a standalone\nbasis as an independent Company and the Company\u2019s 2022 annual budget. The Board also discussed, in\nconsultation with its legal and financial advisors, Republic Services\u2019 request for exclusivity and determined,\nin particular in consideration that there were other interested parties with whom the Company was in active\ndiscussions, that the Company could not grant exclusivity to Republic Services or any other party at that\ntime.\nOn December 22, 2021, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Party A held discussions, during which\nParty A expressed its continued interest in a potential transaction with the Company. The Company\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer indicated that if Party A remained interested, Party A should review and revise its previous\nDecember 11, 2020 proposal.\nOn December 23, 2021, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer telephoned Republic Services\u2019 Chief Executive\nOfficer and indicated Republic Services\u2019 latest proposal was well received and that the Company would be\nwilling to engage in further discussions after entering into a nondisclosure agreement with a customary\nstandstill provision. Furthermore, the Company indicated it would not be able to enter into an exclusivity\nagreement at that time.\nMeanwhile, between December 20, 2021 and January 6, 2022, the Company continued separate discussions\nwith Party E, as well as responding to additional diligence and information requests from Party E.\nOn January 5, 2022, Republic Services\u2019 Chief Executive Officer and the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\ndiscussed Republic Services\u2019 offer and Republic Services\u2019 request for exclusivity, and the Company\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer proposed a joint management meeting during the week of January 17, 2022.\nOn January 6, 2022, Republic Services\u2019 Chief Executive Officer communicated to the Company\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer that Republic Services would be willing to move forward to entering into a nondisclosure\nagreement with a customary standstill provision.\nOn January 7 and January 8, 2022, financial advisors for Republic Services and the Company continued to\ndiscuss a potential transaction. In addition, on January 8, 2022, Republic Services\u2019 Chief Legal Officer sent\ncomments on the draft nondisclosure agreement to Dechert.\nOn January 7, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of discussions with Republic\nServices, Party A, and Party E regarding a potential transaction with the Company. Representatives of\nBarclays and Houlihan Lokey reported that in their respective discussions with Party E, at the direction of\nthe Company, they had requested that Party E refine its proposed valuation based on the due diligence work\ndone to date and provide the Company with an indication of Party E\u2019s remaining diligence-related open items\nalong with Party E\u2019s estimates for when it might be able to conclude its due diligence process. The\nrepresentatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey reported that Party E had indicated that providing a firm\noffer based on the information that had been provided as of that time would be difficult, and in any event,\nsuch offer would not be at the higher end of the range that they had previously provided.\nOn January 11, 2022, members of the Company\u2019s senior management met with representatives of Party A to\ndiscuss, among other things, current business conditions and industry conditions. During this conversation\nParty A indicated that it remained interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company and intended to\nsubmit an updated indication of interest to acquire the Company.\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 11, 2022, the Company and Republic Services executed a nondisclosure agreement, which, among\nother things, included a nine-month standstill obligation in favor of the Company.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of negotiations with Republic\nServices, Party A, and Party E regarding a potential transaction with the Company. The Company\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer explained that the Company was still awaiting an updated proposal from Party A, and the\nTransaction Committee directed the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer to communicate to Party A that it\nshould submit a revised offer in the near term if it remained interested in a potential transaction with the\nCompany. The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer also explained that Party E had now communicated to the\nCompany\u2019s financial advisors on January 11, 2022 that it was withdrawing its proposal and would not be able\nto provide a firm offer at this time without receiving significantly more due diligence information. In\nparticular, Party E cited concerns about the Company\u2019s most recent financial performance and the prospect\nof a negative market reaction to the Company\u2019s financial performance in 2022. The Transaction Committee\nand senior management discussed their shared views that, taking into account the process that had taken\nplace up to that time, Party E was not likely to make a firm offer at a level that would be attractive to the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders and that a transaction was more likely to materialize with Republic Services than\nwith any other potential counterparty. The Transaction Committee therefore authorized senior management\nto continue negotiations with Republic Services and authorized Dechert to begin preparing potential\ndefinitive documentation for a possible transaction with Republic Services.\nOver the course of January 13, 2022 to January 18, 2022, Company\u2019s management team held various meetings\nwith Republic Services\u2019 management team, including in-person due diligence meetings on January 17 and 18,\n2022.\nOn January 21, 2022, Party A contacted the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer indicating Party A had\nconducted more due diligence based on publicly available information and would be submitting an offer\nshortly. It was communicated to Party A that if Party A was still seriously interested, it was in Party A\u2019s best\ninterest to submit a revised proposal imminently.\nOn January 25, 2022, Republic Services submitted verbally a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock at a value of $48.00 per share on an all-cash basis. Republic Services explained\nthat the reasons for its reduction in price from $51.00 per share to $48.00 per share were weakness in the\nCompany\u2019s fourth quarter results, increased capital expenditure needs for the business which exceeded their\nprevious expectations and lower than expected cost synergies that could be achieved from the transaction.\nRepublic Services submitted a written offer confirming the terms on January 27, 2022.\nOn January 25, 2022, Party E contacted the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer to request a meeting to\ndiscuss a potential alternative transaction structure. A meeting date for January 31, 2022 was set to hold\nsuch discussions.\nOn January 26, 2022, the Board, Company management, Dechert, and representatives of Barclays and\nHoulihan Lokey met to discuss, among other things, Republic Services\u2019 revised proposal. The Board along\nwith representatives of its legal and financial advisors discussed the process the Company and the Board\nhad followed to date to evaluate the offers received, and the factors the Board should consider in deciding\non its next steps, including the offers received to date, the likelihood of offers that could reasonably be\nexpected to be received from other parties if solicited, and the disclosure, timing and antitrust risk that could\nbe associated with those offers. The Board then further discussed the Company\u2019s strategic plan and its\nprospects as an independent, standalone company as compared to the immediate value presented by the\nmost recent offer received from Republic Services. Following discussion, the Board agreed that the\nCompany\u2019s Chief Executive Officer should reach out to Republic Services and propose a counteroffer price\nof $50.00 per share. Furthermore, on January 27, 2022, Dechert sent an initial draft of a proposed form of\nmerger agreement to Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (\u201cDavis Polk\u201d), counsel to Republic Services.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board, Company management, Dechert and representatives of Barclays and\nHoulihan Lokey again met to discuss the status of the negotiations with Republic Services. The Company\u2019s\nChief Executive Officer reported to the Board that he had communicated the suggested counteroffer price of\n$50.00 per share, but Republic Services had responded, and confirmed in writing, that $48.00 per share\nrepresented its best and final offer, which offer was contingent upon receiving exclusivity through\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFebruary 8, 2022. After additional deliberation on the merits of Republic Services\u2019 proposal as opposed to the\nother strategic alternatives reasonably available, including continuing on as an independent, standalone\ncompany, and with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, the Board agreed that Republic Services\u2019 offer\nprice of $48.00 per share price represented a more attractive value for the Company\u2019s common stock at that\ntime, and accordingly, directed senior management for the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement\nwith Republic Services through February 8, 2022. By the end of the day on January 27, 2022, the Company\nand Republic Services had reached agreement on the proposed terms of exclusivity and, accordingly, the\nCompany and Republic Services entered into an exclusivity agreement providing that, from such date until\nFebruary 8, 2022, the Company could not solicit or participate in discussions with other third parties\nregarding a potential transaction involving the Company. On January 30, 2022, the Company Chief Executive\nOfficer canceled the scheduled meeting with Party E due to the exclusivity agreement with Republic Services.\nOn January 31, 2022, the Company and Republic Services entered into a \u201cclean team\u201d agreement, which\naddressed the disclosure of potentially competitively sensitive information between the Company and\nRepublic Services. Also on January 31, 2022, Davis Polk sent Republic Services\u2019 initial comments to the draft\nMerger Agreement to Dechert, and it was communicated by the Chief Executive Officer of Republic Services\nto Mr. Feeler that there would not likely be a role for Mr. Feeler with the surviving corporation following the\ntransaction.\nAlso on January 31, 2022, Party A submitted a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the Company\u2019s common\nstock at a value of $46.60 per share on an all-cash basis, subject to a number of conditions, including the\nsatisfactory completion of due diligence on the Company (which they expected to take up to ninety days),\nthe negotiation of mutually agreeable definitive transaction documentation, all required regulatory approvals\nand the approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders. The letter also stated that Party A had sufficient capital to\nfinance the equity portion of the transaction. The Company did not substantively respond to this inquiry\ndue to the exclusivity agreement it had entered into with Republic Services.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of the Merger Agreement, due\ndiligence and ongoing negotiation efforts. At this meeting, the Transaction Committee was informed of Party\nA\u2019s revised offer and that the Company had not substantively responded due to the Company\u2019s exclusivity\nobligations to Republic Services. The Transaction Committee, members of management and the Company\u2019s\nlegal and financial advisors discussed the timing and due diligence process that would need to occur with\nParty A were the Company to pursue Party A\u2019s offer, and considered that the outcome and timing of such a\nprocess was likely to not be dissimilar to what the Company had recently experienced with Party E and that it\nwas highly uncertain whether, at the conclusion of the process, Party A would increase its offer price to an\namount in excess of the $48.00 per share offered by Republic Services.\nOn February 3, 2022, Dechert sent an initial draft of the disclosure schedules to the draft Merger Agreement\nto Davis Polk.\nOn February 5, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of negotiations and to consider\nthe open issues that remained in such negotiations. Representatives of Dechert also provided the\nTransaction Committee with an overview of various possible negotiated solutions to the antitrust risk\nallocation provisions in the Merger Agreement, which remained the most significant open unresolved issue\nwith Republic Services. From February 5, 2022 to February 8, 2022, Dechert and Davis Polk continued to\nnegotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement and disclosure schedules on behalf of the Company and\nRepublic Services, respectively.\nOn February 6, 2022, the Company and Republic Services exchanged limited financial information intended to\nassess potential overlaps. On February 7, 2022, members of management from both Republic Services and the\nCompany and antitrust specialists from both Dechert and Davis Polk discussed the potential overlaps in the\nbusinesses of Republic Services and the Company.\nOn February 7, 2022, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of negotiations with Republic\nServices as well as its and its legal advisors\u2019 ongoing evaluation of the antitrust risk allocation provisions of\nthe Merger Agreement.\n36 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn February 8, 2022, the entire Board met to discuss the status of negotiations with Republic Services.\nDechert reviewed with the Board the principal terms of the Merger Agreement, including the proposed final\noutcome of the antitrust risk allocation provisions, and also reviewed with the Board again the directors\u2019\nfiduciary duties under applicable law in connection with the proposed transaction. At the request of the\nBoard, representatives of Barclays and Houlihan Lokey then reviewed with the Board their respective\nfinancial analyses of the $48.00 per share consideration offered by Republic Services. Thereafter, at the\nrequest of the Board, Barclays rendered its opinion (attached as Annex B to this proxy statement) to the\nBoard to the effect that as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and\nassumptions stated in its written opinion, the consideration to be offered to the holders of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) in the proposed transaction was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders. In addition, at the request of the Board, Houlihan Lokey rendered its\nopinion (attached as Annex C to this proxy statement) to the Board to the effect that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such holders from a\nfinancial point of view. The Board and its legal and financial advisors then discussed the structure and terms\nof the proposed transaction and, after deliberation and consideration of the factors described under\n\u201cReasons for Recommendation\u201d beginning on page 37 of this Proxy Statement and upon the recommendation\nof the Transaction Committee, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby were advisable and in the best interests of, and fair to, the Company and\nits stockholders, (ii) authorized and approved the Company\u2019s entry into the Merger Agreement and\nconsummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) directed that the Merger Agreement be\nsubmitted for consideration at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and (iv) resolved to\nmake the recommendation that the stockholders of the Company adopt and approve the Merger Agreement.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Board meeting, the Company and Republic Services agreed to and finalized\nthe Merger Agreement and the accompanying disclosure schedules on terms consistent with the terms\napproved by the Board. Prior to the opening of U.S. stock markets on February 9, 2022, the Company and\nRepublic Services executed and exchanged the definitive documentation and issued a joint press release\npublicly announcing their entry into the Merger Agreement.\nRecommendation of the Board\nAfter considering the various factors described below, the Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, upon the terms and subject to\nthe conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, are fair to, and in the best interests of, US Ecology and its\nstockholders\u037e (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, including the execution, delivery,\nand performance thereof, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein\u037e (iii) directed that the\nMerger Agreement be submitted to a vote of US Ecology\u2019s stockholders for adoption at the Special Meeting\u037e\nand (iv) resolved to recommend that US Ecology\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger\nAgreement in accordance with the DGCL.\nReasons for Recommendation\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement and the merger, the Board consulted with US Ecology\u2019s senior\nmanagement and its outside financial advisors and legal counsel and, in reaching its determination to\nrecommend that US Ecology stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board relied upon and\nconsidered numerous factors, including the material factors set forth below (provided that, for the avoidance\nof doubt, the order in which such factors appear does not reflect any relative significance):\nFinancial Terms and Certainty of Value - The Board believes the following with respect to the financial\nterms of the Merger Agreement:\nThe belief of the Board that the merger consideration of $48.00 per share in cash of US Ecology\ncommon stock represents full and fair value for shares of US Ecology common stock, taking into\naccount the interests of US Ecology\u2019s stockholders as a whole, and not the interests of any\nindividual stockholder, US Ecology\u2019s current and historical financial condition, results of operations,\nbusiness,\n37 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompetitive position and prospects, as well as US Ecology\u2019s near-term and long-term standalone plan\nin the event US Ecology were to remain an independent public company, and the future prospects\nand risks associated with remaining an independent, standalone company and the risks and\nuncertainties associated with the execution of the standalone plan.\nThe opportunity for US Ecology\u2019s stockholders to realize substantial value based on the receipt of\nthe merger consideration representing a significant premium of (i) 70% to the closing share price of\nFebruary 8, 2022, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger, and a premium of\napproximately 62% to the 30-day volume weighted average price of February 8, 2022 and (ii) 79% to\nthe closing share price of February 7, 2022, the last trading day prior to the publication by Bloomberg\nof an article claiming that US Ecology and Republic Services were in advanced negotiations regarding\na potential transaction.\nThe fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, which provides certainty of value and\nliquidity to the stockholders of US Ecology and does not expose them to any future risks related to\nthe business or the financial markets generally, as compared to a transaction in which stockholders\nreceive equity or other securities, or as compared to remaining an independent, standalone company.\nThe financial analysis reviewed by Barclays with the Board as well as the oral opinion of Barclays\n(which oral opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of\nFebruary 8, 2022), provided to the Board, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject\nto the qualifications, limitations, conditions and assumptions set forth in such opinion and other\nmatters considered in preparation thereof, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of\nUS Ecology common stock (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) in the merger is fair, from\na financial point of view, to such holders. A copy of the written opinion of Barclays is attached as\nAnnex B to this Proxy Statement, and such written opinion is also described more fully in the\n\u201cOpinions of Financial Advisors\u201d section of this Proxy Statement.\nThe financial analysis reviewed by Houlihan Lokey with the Board as well as the opinion of Houlihan\nLokey rendered to the Board on February 8, 2022 to the effect that, as of such date and based upon\nand subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received\nby the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair\nto such holders from a financial point of view. A copy of the written opinion of Houlihan Lokey is\nattached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement, and such written opinion is also described more fully in\nthe \u201cOpinions of Financial Advisors\u201d section of this Proxy Statement.\nThe fact that appraisal rights will be available to the holders of US Ecology common stock who\nproperly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these stockholders the ability to\nseek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of US Ecology\ncommon stock if they do not wish to accept the merger consideration.\nThe fact that the merger consideration Republic Services agreed pay to the holders of US Ecology\ncommon stock was increased from Republic Services\u2019 initial offer of between $40.00 and $42.00 per\nshare of US Ecology common stock to the final negotiated merger consideration price of $48.00 per\nshare of US Ecology common stock as a result of extensive arms\u2019-length negotiations, as described in\nthe \u201cBackground of the Merger\u201d section of this Proxy Statement.\nThe fact that the parties have agreed that all outstanding stock options, performance stock units,\nrestricted share awards and restricted stock units of US Ecology, whether vested or unvested, under\nthe Amended and Restated US Ecology, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan will automatically vest and settle\nin cash based on the value of the merger consideration, rather than being assumed by, and converted\ninto equity awards of, Republic Services, which provides certainty of value and liquidity to holders of\nUS Ecology equity awards and does not expose them to the risk of lost value based on Republic\nServices\u2019 performance or future risks related to the financial markets generally.\nProspects of US Ecology - The Board believes that the consummation of the transactions represent US\nEcology\u2019s best reasonably available alternative for maximizing stockholder value based upon the Board\u2019s\nreview of US Ecology\u2019s current and historical business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncompetitive position, strategic options and prospects, as well as US Ecology\u2019s near-term and long-term\n38 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022

risks and uncertainties\nassociated with the execution of the standalone plan, and the potential impact of those factors on the future\ntrading price of US Ecology common stock, including risks related to:\nThe general business environment for the industries in which US Ecology operates, including\nindustry trends, increased labor, transportation and fuel costs, customer supply chain disruptions,\nhigh levels of capital expenditures, and substantial governmental regulation and involvement\u037e\nThe costs, risks and uncertainties relating to the execution by US Ecology of its near-term and\nlong-term standalone plan in the event US Ecology were to remain an independent public\ncompany factoring in ongoing COVID-19 pandemic related challenges to labor markets,\ninflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and general investor sentiment toward\ncommodity exposed businesses and less predictable end markets\u037e\nThe additional costs and burdens involved with being a public company\u037e\nThe U.S. and global economy and general stock market conditions and volatility\u037e\nThe adverse impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the government and other\nrestrictions imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain or mitigate the COVID-19\npandemic, on US Ecology\u2019s operations\u037e and\nThe other risks and uncertainties identified in US Ecology\u2019s filings with the SEC, including in its\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nProcess and Consideration of Alternatives - The Board believes the following with respect to the process it\nhas taken which resulted in the execution of the Merger Agreement with Republic Services and the\nalternative options reasonably available:\nThe Board\u2019s belief, based on a review of the possible alternatives to a sale of US Ecology, including\nthe prospects of continuing to operate in accordance with the near-term and long-term strategic plan,\nthe potential value to US Ecology stockholders of such alternatives and the timing and likelihood of\nactually achieving additional value for such stockholders from these alternatives, that none of these\noptions, on a risk- and time-adjusted basis, was reasonably likely to create value for US Ecology\nstockholders greater than the merger consideration.\nThe fact that US Ecology had preliminary discussions with respect to a potential material transaction\ninvolving US Ecology with a number of other potential strategic and financial counterparties since\nJanuary 2021 and continuing in 2022, none of which provided any indication that they were willing\nand able to complete a transaction on terms that were more favorable to US Ecology\u2019s stockholders\nthan the proposal made by Republic Services, as described in the \u201cBackground of the Merger\u201d section\nof this Proxy Statement.\nThe determination by the Board, after discussion with US Ecology\u2019s senior management, that\nRepublic Services was the most logical acquirer of US Ecology and, in light of US Ecology\u2019s\ncomplementary businesses, as well as the projected synergies that would result from the combination,\ntogether with Republic Services\u2019 strong balance sheet and financial position, that Republic Services\nwould be the potential transaction partner most likely to offer the best combination of value and\nclosing certainty to US Ecology\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Board\u2019s beliefs that an all-cash transaction represented a more attractive opportunity for US\nEcology\u2019s stockholders than a potentially more complicated, less liquid form of consideration that\nmay be offered by other counterparties, such as equity securities, or a mix of cash and stock.\nThe Board\u2019s beliefs that a transaction with a strategic operating company with complementary\nbusinesses was more likely to unlock value for US Ecology\u2019s stockholders than a transaction with a\nfinancial buyer, particularly in light of the heightened risks associated with financing uncertainty\nbased on the Company\u2019s recent operating results and the complications and challenges that may\nresult from the extensive due diligence process that would be necessary in attempting to partner with\na counterparty with less complete understanding of US Ecology\u2019s businesses and the industries and\nmarkets in which it operates.\n39 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Board\u2019s concerns, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the pool of potential\nstrategic partners with sufficient market capitalization and resources to act as an acquirer of US\nEcology was limited considerably by the fact that certain prospective acquirers were competitors of\nUS Ecology that would present heightened risk that a negotiated transaction would ultimately be\nprohibited or significantly constrained or changed by regulatory authorities due to antitrust\nconcerns.\nThe Board\u2019s beliefs that there were no other credible potential parties that might have an interest in\nengaging in a strategic transaction with US Ecology at a value higher than Republic Services\u2019\nproposal, that the potential regulatory, commercial and financing issues that might arise in connection\nwith pursuing such an alternative transaction, and that Republic Services would withdraw from\nconsideration of a potential transaction if US Ecology were to pursue discussions with other\npotential counterparties.\nThe fact that, even upon entering into the Merger Agreement, the \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions (as more\nfully described in the \u201cBoard Recommendation\u037e Change of Recommendation\u037e Fiduciary Exception\u201d section\nof this Proxy Statement) and relatively modest termination fee (including as more fully described in\nthe \u201cTermination Fee\u201d section of this Proxy Statement) ensured that US Ecology\u2019s stockholders would\nstill have an opportunity to realize the benefits of a potential alternative transaction in the event\nanother counterparty emerged following the announcement of US Ecology\u2019s entry into the Merger\nAgreement and expressed a willingness to acquire US Ecology at a more advantageous price to US\nEcology stockholders.\nThe Board\u2019s beliefs that Republic Services was the potential counterparty interested in proceeding\nwith an acquisition of US Ecology that represented the most attractive combination of (i) the highest\nper share price offered after complete due diligence, (ii) an expeditious timeline to closing, (iii) less\npotential antitrust risk than other potential counterparties, and (iv) a high degree of closing certainty.\nLikelihood of Consummation - The Board believes the transaction is likely to be consummated for the\nfollowing reasons:\nThe business reputation and capabilities of Republic Services and its management.\nThe fact that Republic Services\u2019 obligation to complete the transactions is not conditioned on\nRepublic Services or Merger Sub obtaining financing.\nThe fact that the Merger Agreement requires Republic Services to use its reasonable best efforts to\ntake actions necessary to satisfy the regulatory conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and\nincludes a commitment by Republic Services to obtain applicable consents and approvals under\nantitrust laws and assume the risks related to certain conditions and requirements that may be\nimposed by regulators in connection with securing such consents and approvals up to specified\nthresholds and limitations, as more fully described in the \u201cEfforts to Complete the Merger\u037e Regulatory\nApprovals\u201d section of this Proxy Statement.\nTerms of the Merger Agreement - The Board believes the following with respect to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and the merger:\nThe Board considered all of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties, the conditions to closing, the\nform of the merger consideration and the termination rights, including:\nThat the terms of the Merger Agreement were the products of arms\u2019-length negotiations among\nsophisticated parties and their respective legal and financial advisors, as more fully described in\nthe \u201cBackground of the Merger\u201d section of this Proxy Statement\u037e\nThat the \u201cfiduciary out\u201d provisions, subject to US Ecology\u2019s compliance with the terms and\nconditions of the Merger Agreement, give the Board the ability to furnish information to, and\nengage in negotiations with, third parties that have made an unsolicited bona fide written\nTakeover Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement, which definition is summarized below)\nthat is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement, which definition is summarized below) and, upon payment of a termination fee and\n40 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompliance with the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, terminate the Merger\nAgreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as more fully\ndescribed in the \u201cNo Solicitation\u037e Takeover Proposals\u201d section of this Proxy Statement)\u037e\nThat the Board has the ability in certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, to\nchange, qualify, withdraw or modify its recommendation that US Ecology stockholders vote to\nadopt the Merger Agreement (as more fully described in the \u201cBoard Recommendation\u037e Change of\nRecommendation\u037e Fiduciary Exception\u201d section of this Proxy Statement)\u037e\nThe fact that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by US Ecology or Republic Services under\ncertain circumstances relating to the merger being prohibited as a result of an applicable antitrust law\nor governmental order, Republic Services will be required to reimburse US Ecology for 50% of its\nreasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger up to\n$5,000,000 (i.e., Republic Services\u2019 reimbursement shall not exceed $2,500,000).\nThe fact that, subject to certain customary limitations, US Ecology will have sufficient operating\nflexibility for it to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the\npre-closing period\u037e\nThe fact that the conditions to the closing are specific and limited in scope\u037e\nThe fact that a vote of US Ecology stockholders is required under the DGCL to adopt the Merger\nAgreement\u037e and\nThat the remedies of specific performance and monetary damages are available to US Ecology under\nthe Merger Agreement as more fully described in the \u201cLimitations on Remedies\u037e Specific Performance\u201d\nsection of this Proxy Statement.\nIn addition to the factors above, the Board identified and considered a variety of risks and potentially\nnegative factors concerning the merger, including:\nThe fact that US Ecology\u2019s stockholders will lose the opportunity to realize additional potential long-\nterm value through US Ecology\u2019s successful execution as an independent, standalone company.\nThe possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and the risks and costs to US Ecology in\nsuch event, including the diversion of management and employee attention and the potential\ndisruptive effect on US Ecology\u2019s businesses, customer and vendor relationships, stock price and\nability to attract and retain key management personnel and employees\u037e\nThe possibility that completion of the merger might be delayed or subject to adverse conditions that\nmay be imposed by governmental authorities that are not within US Ecology\u2019s control, that the\nrequired governmental approvals may not be obtained at all, and the period of time US Ecology may\nbe subject to the Merger Agreement without assurance that the merger will be completed\u037e\nThe fact that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, US Ecology\nmay be required to pay Republic Services a termination fee in the amount of $46,253,000 and that this\ntermination fee may discourage other parties that may otherwise have an interest in a business\ncombination with, or an acquisition of US Ecology\u037e\nThe fact that upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Republic Services will not be obligated to\npay any \u201creverse termination fee\u201d to US Ecology.\nThe significant costs involved in connection with completing the merger, the substantial management\ntime and effort required to complete the merger, and the related potential disruption to US Ecology\u2019s\noperations\u037e\nThe amount of time it could take from the date of the Board\u2019s deliberations and the Special Meeting to\nconsummate the transactions, including the fact that an extended period of time may exacerbate the\nimpact of other risks considered by the Board described herein\u037e\nThe restrictions on US Ecology\u2019s conduct of business prior to the consummation of the merger\ncontained in the Merger Agreement (as further described in the \u201cConduct of Business Pending the\nMerger\u201d section of this Proxy Statement), which could delay or prevent US Ecology from undertaking\n41 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusiness opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations during the\npendency of the merger without Republic Services\u2019 consent, and the impact of such delay or loss of\nbusiness opportunities on US Ecology\u2019s business in the event that the merger is not consummated.\nThe limitations imposed on the solicitation or consideration by US Ecology of alternative\ntransactions prior to the receipt of stockholder approval of the merger and the other terms and\nconditions of the Merger Agreement, subject to the Board\u2019s \u201cfiduciary out\u201d exception (as more fully\ndescribed in the \u201cBoard Recommendation\u037e Change of Recommendation\u037e Fiduciary Exception\u201d section of\nthis Proxy Statement)\u037e\nThat the Board is required to submit the merger to the vote of US Ecology stockholders at the Special\nMeeting even if the Board has made a change of recommendation, unless the Merger Agreement is\nterminated\u037e\nThe interests that certain US Ecology executive officers and directors may have with respect to the\nmerger in addition to their interests as US Ecology stockholders as described in the \u201cInterests of US\nEcology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d section of this Proxy Statement\u037e and\nThat the gain likely to be realized by US Ecology stockholders as a result of the merger generally will\nbe taxable to such stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes if they are not otherwise exempt\nfrom the payment of such taxes (as more fully described in the \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger\u201d section of this Proxy Statement).\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be\nexhaustive, but rather includes the principal material information, factors and analyses considered by the\nBoard in reaching its conclusions and recommendation in relation to the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions. The Board evaluated the various factors listed above in light of its knowledge of the business,\nfinancial condition and prospects of US Ecology, in consultation with US Ecology\u2019s senior management and\noutside legal and financial advisors. The Board did not provide a specific assessment of, quantify or\notherwise assign any relative weights to, the factors considered in determining its recommendation. Instead,\nthe Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors and reasons described above and determined in its\nbusiness judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the merger to the stockholders of US\nEcology outweighed the risks or potential negative consequences. Individual members of the Board may\nhave given different weight to different factors. In addition, in arriving at its recommendation, the directors\nof US Ecology were aware of the interests of certain officers and directors of US Ecology as described in the\n\u201cInterests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d section of this Proxy Statement.\nOpinions of Financial Advisors\nBarclays and Houlihan Lokey were retained as co-financial advisors to the Company in connection with a\npotential strategic transaction involving the Company. As part of that engagement, the Board requested that\neach of the Co-Financial Advisors render an opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, to US Ecology stockholders of the merger consideration to be offered to or received by (as applicable)\nsuch stockholders in the merger. On February 8, 2022, at a meeting of the Board held to evaluate the\nproposed merger, Barclays rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based upon and\nsubject to the various procedures, assumptions and matters considered and the qualifications and limitations\ndescribed in such opinion, the merger consideration to be offered to the US Ecology stockholders (other\nthan the holders of Excluded Shares) in the merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nstockholders. At the same meeting of the Board, Houlihan Lokey rendered its opinion to the Board to the\neffect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was fair to such holders from a financial point of view.\nThe full text of Barclays\u2019 and Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinions describe the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters\nconsidered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by each respective Co-Financial Advisor.\nBarclays\u2019 opinion is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated by reference herein, and\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion is attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated by reference herein.\nBarclays\u2019 opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsuch) in connection with, and for the purpose of, its evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nmerger consideration to be offered to the holders of US Ecology common stock (other than the holders of Excluded\nShares) in the merger, and does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related transaction. Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s opinion was provided for the benefit of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with, and for the\npurpose of, its evaluation of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by\nthe holders of US Ecology common stock in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and does not address any\nother aspect of the merger or any related transaction. The opinion of each Co-Financial Advisor does not address the\nrelative merits of the merger or any related transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions that\nmight be available to US Ecology or US Ecology\u2019s underlying business decision to effect the merger or any related\ntransaction. The opinion of each Co-Financial Advisor does not constitute a recommendation to any US Ecology\nstockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the merger or any related transaction. The\nfollowing summary of each Co-Financial Advisor\u2019s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of\neach Co-Financial Advisor\u2019s opinion.\nThe merger consideration was determined through arms\u2019-length negotiations between US Ecology and\nRepublic Services and their respective representatives and the decision by the Board to recommend that US\nEcology enter into the merger was solely that of the Board, and the decision by US Ecology to enter into the\nmerger was solely that of the Board. Each Co-Financial Advisor\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only\none of many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the views of the Board or the management of US Ecology with respect to the merger or the\nmerger consideration to be offered to or received by (as applicable) US Ecology stockholders in the merger.\nThe following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by each Co-Financial Advisor\nand reviewed with the Board on February 8, 2022 in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses\nsummarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order for each Co-Financial Advisor\u2019s financial\nanalyses to be fully understood, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data below without considering the full\nnarrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses,\ncould create a misleading or incomplete view of each Co-Financial Advisor\u2019s financial analyses.\nOpinion and Financial Analyses of Barclays\nThe Company engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives\nfor the Company, including a possible sale of the Company, pursuant to an engagement letter dated January\n14, 2021. On February 8, 2022, Barclays rendered its opinion to the Board that, as of such date and based\nupon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the consideration\nto be offered to the stockholders (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) is fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such stockholders.\nThe full text of Barclays\u2019 written opinion, dated as of February 8, 2022, is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement.\nBarclays\u2019 written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors\nconsidered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to\nread the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays\u2019 opinion and the methodology that\nBarclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the\nopinion.\nBarclays\u2019 opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays\u2019 Valuation and Fairness Opinion\nCommittee, is addressed to the Board, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the\nconsideration to be offered to the stockholders (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) and does not\nconstitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the\nproposed transaction or any other matter. The terms of the proposed transaction were determined through\narm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and Republic Services and were unanimously approved by\nthe Board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to the Company or that any\nspecific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed transaction.\nBarclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the\n43 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany\u2019s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed transaction, the likelihood\nof the consummation of the proposed transaction, or the relative merits of the proposed transaction as\ncompared to any other transaction in which the Company may engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no\nopinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any\ncompensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the proposed transaction, or any class\nof such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the stockholders in the proposed transaction.\nIn addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness\nof the amount or the nature of any compensation to any holder of warrants issued by the Company, or any\nclass of such persons, or the treatment of any such warrants in or adjustments to their terms and conditions\nresulting from the proposed transaction, relative to the treatment of the Company\u2019s common stock, the\nconsideration to be offered to the stockholders in the proposed transaction or otherwise. No limitations were\nimposed by the Board upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in\nrendering its opinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:\nreviewed and analyzed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated as of February 8, 2022, and the specific\nterms of the proposed transaction\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning the Company that Barclays believed\nto be relevant to its analysis, including the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31,\nJune 30 and September 30, 2021\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations\nand prospects of the Company furnished to Barclays by the Company, including financial projections\nprepared by the Company\u2019s management, referred to as the \u201cProjections\u201d  (as defined below) (for\nfurther information regarding the Projections, please see the section of this Proxy Statement entitled\n\u201cProjected Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 58)\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed a trading history of the Company\u2019s common stock over a certain period and a\ncomparison of such trading history with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition\nof the Company and certain multiples of financial metrics based on the financial metrics of the\nCompany with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the\nfuture financial performance and price targets of the Company\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed a comparison of the financial terms of the proposed transaction with the\nfinancial terms of certain other transactions that Barclays deemed relevant\u037e\nhad discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets,\nliabilities, financial condition and prospects\u037e and\nhad undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial\nand other information used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and had\nnot assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information). Barclays also\nrelied upon the assurances of management of the Company that they were not aware of any facts or\ncircumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Projections,\nupon advice of the Company, Barclays assumed that such Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the\nCompany\u2019s future financial performance and that the Company would perform substantially in accordance\nwith such Projections. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed no responsibility for and expressed no\nview as to any such Projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its\nopinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and\ndid not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. In addition,\nBarclays was not authorized by the Company to solicit, and did not solicit, any\n44 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nindications of interest from any third party with respect to the purchase of all or a part of the Company\u2019s\nbusiness. Barclays\u2019 opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they\nexisted on, and could be evaluated as of, February 8, 2022. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating\nor revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that may have occurred after, February 8, 2022.\nBarclays assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would conform in all material respects to the last\ndraft reviewed by Barclays. Additionally, Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and\nwarranties contained in the Merger Agreement and all the agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed,\nupon the advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals,\nconsents and releases for the proposed would be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement and that the proposed transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of\nthe Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or\nagreement thereof. Barclays did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might\nresult from the proposed transaction, nor did Barclays\u2019 opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or\naccounting matters, as to which Barclays understood the Company had obtained such advice as it deemed\nnecessary from qualified professionals.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other\nanalyses as summarized below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values\nto the Company\u2019s common stock but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial point of\nview, to the stockholders (other than the holders of any Excluded Shares) of the consideration to be offered\nto such stockholders in the proposed transaction on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the\nmost appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those\nmethods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary\ndescription.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor\nconsidered by it but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis\nand factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the\ncircumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be\nconsidered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all\nanalyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its\nopinion.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the\nBoard. The summary of Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of the\nanalyses and reviews underlying Barclays\u2019 opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and\nreview and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and, therefore, is not readily\nsusceptible to summary description.\nFor the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which\nare beyond the control of the Company or any other parties to the proposed transaction. No company,\nbusiness or transaction considered in Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews is identical to the Company, Republic\nServices, Merger Sub or the proposed transaction, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and\nreviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and\njudgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the\nacquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in\nBarclays\u2019 analyses and reviews. None of the Company, Republic Services, Merger Sub, Barclays or any other\nperson assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates\ncontained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis\nor review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may\nbe significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of\ncompanies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the\ncompanies,\n45 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusinesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived\nfrom, Barclays\u2019 analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nThe summary of the financial analyses and reviews summarized below include information presented in\ntabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables\nmust be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete\ndescription of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without\nconsidering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions\nunderlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Barclays\u2019 analyses and\nreviews.\nSelected Comparable Company Analysis\nIn order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a\nrange of relative implied equity values per share of Company common stock by reference to those\ncompanies, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial and operating data relating to the Company\nwith selected companies that Barclays, based on its experience in the waste treatment and disposal industry,\ndeemed comparable to the Company. The selected comparable companies with respect to the Company were:\nSpecialty Waste Companies\nStericycle, Inc.\nClean Harbors, Inc.\nHarsco Corporation\nHeritage-Crystal Clean, Inc.\nSolid Waste Companies\nCasella Waste Systems, Inc.\nWaste Connections, Inc.\nWaste Management, Inc.\nGFL Environmental Inc.\nRepublic Services\nExploration & Production Companies:\nSecure Energy Services Inc.\nBarclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of the Company and the selected\ncomparable companies. As part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and\nanalyzed each company\u2019s ratio of enterprise value to estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization, or EBITDA, for the calendar year 2022 (which were calendarized as appropriate and\nadjusted as appropriate for certain accounting-related matters). The enterprise value of each company was\nobtained by adding its short and long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its common equity, the\nvalue of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and the book value of any minority interest, and\nsubtracting its cash and cash equivalents. All of these calculations were performed, and based on publicly\navailable financial data (including FactSet) and closing prices, as of February 4, 2022. The results of this\nselected comparable company analysis are summarized below:\nEnterprise Value as a Multiple of Calendar Year 2022 Estimated EBITDA\nSelected Comparable Companies\nMedian\nAverage\nRange\nSpecialty Waste Companies\n8.9x\n9.6x\n6.7x\u202f-\u202f14.0x\nSolid Waste Companies\n13.9x\n15.6x\n13.5x\u202f-\u202f19.4x\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, this selected comparable company analysis resulted in a 7.2x multiple for Secure Energy Services\nInc.\u2019s ratio of enterprise value to estimated EBITDA for the calendar year 2022 (adjusted as appropriate for\ncertain accounting-related matters).\nBarclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more business or\noperating characteristics with the Company. However, because no selected comparable company is exactly\nthe same as the Company, Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on\nthe quantitative results of the selected comparable company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made\nqualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics\nand prospects of the Company and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading\nvalues of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.\nThese qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and\ndegree of operational risk between the Company and the companies included in the selected company\nanalysis. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of 8.5x to 10.5x the Company\u2019s fiscal year\nending December 31, 2022 estimated EBITDA excluding non-recurring and non-cash items and expenses as\napplicable, or Adjusted EBITDA, based on the management projections. Barclays then calculated a range of\nimplied prices per share of Company common stock by (i) subtracting estimated net debt as of December 31,\n2021 from the estimated enterprise value (ii) adding to such amount estimated future investments of\napproximately $12 million by the Company in a privately-held company and (iii) dividing such amount by the\nfully diluted number of shares of Company common stock based on information provided by the\nmanagement of the Company. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the\nnearest $0.50):\nLow\nHigh\nImplied Price per Share of Company Common Stock\n$27.00\n$38.50\nBarclays noted that on the basis of the selected comparable company analysis, the transaction consideration\nof $48.00 per share of Company common stock was above the range of implied values per share of Company\ncommon stock calculated.\nSelected Precedent Transaction Analysis\nBarclays reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples paid in selected other\ntransactions that Barclays, based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed\nrelevant. Barclays chose such transactions based on, among other things, the similarity of the applicable\ntarget companies in the transactions to the Company with respect to the size, mix, margins and other\ncharacteristics of their businesses. Using publicly available information, Barclays analyzed the ratio of the\napplicable target companies\u2019 enterprise values to their last 12 months, or LTM, EBITDA, which is referred to\nbelow as EV/LTM EBITDA.\nThe reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed\nwere diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and\nprospects of the Company and the companies included in the selected precedent transaction analysis.\nAccordingly, Barclays believed that a purely quantitative selected precedent transaction analysis would not\nbe particularly meaningful in the context of considering the proposed transaction. Barclays therefore made\nqualitative judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of the selected precedent\ntransactions and the proposed transaction which would affect the acquisition values of the selected target\ncompanies and the Company. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of 9.5x to 11.5x and\napplied such range to the Company\u2019s fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA based on the\nmanagement projections. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Company common\nstock by (i) subtracting estimated net debt as of December 31, 2021 from the estimated enterprise value (ii)\nadding to such amount estimated future investments of approximately $12 million by the Company in a\nprivately-held company and (iii) dividing such amount by the fully diluted number of shares of Company\ncommon stock based on information provided by the management of the Company. The following table sets\nforth the transactions analyzed based on such characteristics and the results of such analysis (rounded to\nthe nearest $0.50):\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAnnouncement\nDate\nSpecialty/Solid\nWaste\nAcquiror\nTarget\nJanuary 2016\nSolid Waste\nWaste Connections, Inc.\nProgressive Waste Solutions Ltd.\nJune 2018\nSpecialty Waste\nHennessy Capital Acquisition\nCorp.

A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology\nused to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the \u201cpresent value\u201d of estimated future cash flows of\nthe asset. \u201cPresent value\u201d refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by\ndiscounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic\nassumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate\nfactors.\nBarclays first calculated the estimated enterprise value of the Company using the discounted cash flow\nmethod, Barclays added (i) the Company\u2019s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for fiscal years 2022\nthrough 2026, based on management projections, to (ii) the \u201cterminal value\u201d of the Company and (iii) any tax\nsavings from the use of net operating losses, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range\nof selected discount rates. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the Adjusted\nEBITDA of the Company and (i) subtracting cash expenses, cash taxes and capital expenditures and (ii)\nadjusting for changes in working capital, in each case based on the management projections. The residual\nvalue of the Company at the end of the forecast period, or \u201cterminal value,\u201d was estimated by selecting a\nrange of perpetuity growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0%, which were derived by Barclays utilizing its professional\njudgment and experience. The range of after-tax discount rates of 8.5% to 9.5% was selected based on an\nanalysis of the unlevered beta of the Company and the capital structures of the selected comparable\ncompanies.\nBarclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Company common stock by (i) subtracting\nestimated net debt as of December 31, 2021 from the estimated enterprise value using the\n48 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndiscounted cash flow method (ii) adding to such amount estimated future investments of approximately $12\nmillion by the Company in a privately-held company and (iii) dividing such amount by the fully diluted\nnumber of shares of Company common stock based on information provided by the management of the\nCompany. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the nearest $0.50):\nSelected Terminal\nValue \nPerpetuity Growth\nRates\nImplied Value per\nShare of \nCompany Common\nStock\nDiscount Rates of 8.5%\u202f-\u202f9.5%\n2.0%\u202f-\u202f3.0%\n$38.50\u202f-\u202f$59.00\nBarclays noted that on the basis of the discounted cash flow analysis, the transaction consideration of\n$48.00 per share of Company common stock was within the range of implied values per share of Company\ncommon stock calculated using management projections.\nPresent Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nBarclays performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per\nshare of Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a\ntheoretical future value of a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s financial projections and\nvaluation multiples.\nBarclays first calculated the implied future enterprise values of the Company for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years by applying ratios of the Company\u2019s enterprise value\nto Adjusted EBITDA for the next twelve months, or NTM, period (\u201cEV to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples\u201d)\nranging from 8.5x to 10.5x to NTM Adjusted EBITDA estimates for the Company as reflected in the\nmanagement projections for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\nThe illustrative EV to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates were derived by Barclays utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical trading data, and was based\nupon the midpoint trading multiple of comparable companies.\nBarclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Company common stock by (i) subtracting the\nprojected amount of the Company\u2019s net debt as of each respective fiscal year end based on management\nprojections, (ii) adding to such amount estimated future investments of approximately $12 million by the\nCompany in a privately-held company, (iii) dividing such amount by the estimated fully diluted number of\nshares of Company common stock derived from management projections and (iv) adding to such future\nequity values per share of Company common stock the anticipated amount of annual dividends per share of\nCompany common stock, as applicable, based on the management projections.\nUtilizing a discount rate of 9.9%, reflecting an estimate of the cost of equity for the Company and derived by\napplication of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires taking into account the selected comparable\ncompanies\u2019 capital structure, the Company\u2019s unlevered beta, market risk premium, yields for U.S. Treasury\nnotes, tax rates and other appropriate factors, Barclays then derived a range of implied present values per\nshare of Company common stock for the Company by discounting to present value, the implied future values\nper share of Company common stock as a stand-alone entity as of December 31, 2021. The following table\npresents the results of the analysis of the implied present value of the illustrative future value per share of\nCompany common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.50) for the fiscal year ending 2023:\nSelected EV to NTM\nAdjusted \nEBITDA multiple Range\nImplied Value per\nShare of \nCompany Common\nStock\nPresent Value of Future Stock Price\n8.5x\u202f-\u202f10.5x\n$47.50\u202f-\u202f$62.00\nBarclays noted that on the basis of the illustrative future share price analysis, the transaction consideration\nof $48.00 was within the range of implied values per share of Company common stock calculated using\nmanagement projections.\nOther Factors\nBarclays also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial analyses\nin connection with rendering its advice, but were references for informational purposes, including, among\nother things, the Historical Share Price Analysis and Analyst Price Targets Analysis described below.\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHistorical Share Price Analysis\nTo illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of the Company\u2019s common stock, Barclays considered\nhistorical data with regard to the trading prices of the Company\u2019s common stock for the period from January\n1, 2021 to February 4, 2022. Barclays noted that during the period from January 1, 2021 to February 4, 2022,\nthe closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.50) ranged from $27.00 to\n$45.00. The Historical Share Price Analysis was used for informational purposes only and was not included\nin Barclays\u2019 financial analyses.\nAnalyst Price Targets Analysis\nBarclays reviewed and compared publicly available research analysts\u2019 per share price targets as of February\n4, 2022 for the Company\u2019s common stock. The research analysts\u2019 per share price targets for the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock ranged from $36.00 to $45.00. The publicly available per share price targets published by\nsecurities research analysts do not necessarily reflect the current market trading prices for the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including future financial performance of the\nCompany and future market conditions. Barclays noted that the transaction consideration of $48.00 was\nabove the range of analyst price targets for the Company\u2019s common stock. Research analyst price targets for\nthe Company were used for informational purposes only and were not included in Barclays\u2019 financial\nanalyses.\nGeneral\nBarclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking\nactivities, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers\nand acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids,\nsecondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate,\ncorporate and other purposes. The Board selected Barclays because of its familiarity with the Company and\nits qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with\nmergers and acquisitions generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the\nproposed transaction.\nBarclays is acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the proposed transaction. As\ncompensation for its services in connection with the proposed transaction, the Company paid Barclays $1.5\nmillion upon the delivery of Barclays\u2019 opinion, which is referred to as the \u201cOpinion Fee\u201d. The Opinion Fee\nwas not contingent upon the conclusion of Barclays\u2019 opinion or the consummation of the proposed\ntransaction. Additional compensation of approximately $16 million to $17 million will be payable on\ncompletion of the proposed transaction against which the amounts paid for the opinion will be credited. In\naddition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion of its reasonable out-of-pocket\nexpenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction, up to an aggregate amount of $75,000\n(excluding reimbursable legal fees), and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its\nengagement by the Company and the rendering of Barclays\u2019 opinion. Barclays has performed various\ninvestment banking services for the Company and Republic Services in the past, and expects to perform\nsuch services in the future, and has received, and expects to receive, customary fees for such services.\nDuring the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Barclays has provided various investment banking\nservices to Republic Services for which Barclays has received compensation in an amount of less than $2\nmillion.

The summary of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion in this Proxy Statement\nis qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is attached as Annex C to this Proxy\nStatement and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review\nundertaken and other matters considered by Houlihan Lokey in connection with the preparation of its opinion.\nHowever, neither Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this\nProxy Statement are intended to be, and do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to the Board, any security\nholder of the Company or any other person as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the merger.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Houlihan Lokey, among other things:\nreviewed a draft dated February 8, 2022 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that\nHoulihan Lokey deemed to be relevant, including certain publicly available research analyst estimates\nwith respect to the future financial performance of the Company\u037e\nreviewed certain information relating to the historical, current and future operations, financial\ncondition and prospects of the Company made available to Houlihan Lokey by the Company,\nincluding the Projections (as defined below).\nspoke with certain members of the management of the Company and certain of its representatives and\nadvisors regarding the business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company, the\nmerger and related matters\u037e\ncompared the financial and operating performance of the Company with that of public companies that\nHoulihan Lokey deemed to be relevant\u037e\nconsidered publicly available financial terms of certain transactions that Houlihan Lokey deemed to\nbe relevant\u037e\nreviewed the current and historical market prices and trading volume for certain of the Company\u2019s\npublicly traded securities, and the current and historical market prices of the publicly traded\nsecurities of certain other companies that Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant\u037e and\nconducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information\nand factors as Houlihan Lokey deemed appropriate.\nHoulihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness\nof all data, material and other information furnished, or otherwise made available, to\n51 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHoulihan Lokey, discussed with or reviewed by Houlihan Lokey, or publicly available, and did not assume\nany responsibility with respect to such data, material and other information. In addition, management of the\nCompany advised Houlihan Lokey, and Houlihan Lokey assumed, that the financial projections (and\nadjustments thereto) reviewed by Houlihan Lokey were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases\nreflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to the future financial\nresults and condition of the Company and the other matters covered thereby, and Houlihan Lokey expressed\nno opinion with respect to such projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Houlihan Lokey\nrelied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there was no change in the business,\nassets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the Company since\nthe respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise,\nprovided to Houlihan Lokey that would be material to Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses or its opinion, and that\nthere was no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Houlihan Lokey\nincomplete or misleading.\nHoulihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and\nwarranties of all parties to the Merger Agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are\nreferred to therein were true and correct, (b) each party to the Merger Agreement and other related\ndocuments and instruments would fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to\nbe performed by such party, (c) all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without\nwaiver thereof, and (d) the merger would be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms\ndescribed in the Merger Agreement and other related documents and instruments, without any amendments\nor modifications thereto.

Houlihan\nLokey also relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, at the direction of the Company, that\nany adjustments to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement would not be material to Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s analyses or its opinion. In addition, Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent\nverification, that the final form of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect from the draft of the\nMerger Agreement identified above.\nFurthermore, in connection with Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion, Houlihan Lokey was not requested to make, and\ndid not make, any physical inspection or independent appraisal or evaluation of any of the assets, properties\nor liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company or any other party,\nnor was Houlihan Lokey provided with any such appraisal or evaluation. Houlihan Lokey did not estimate,\nand expressed no opinion regarding, the liquidation value of any entity or business. Houlihan Lokey did not\nundertake any independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible\nunasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which the Company was or may be a party or was or may\nbe subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other contingent\nliabilities to which the Company was or may be a party or was or may be subject.\nHoulihan Lokey was not requested to, and did not, initiate any discussions or negotiations with, or solicit\nany indications of interest from, third parties with respect to the securities, assets, business or operations of\nthe Company or any other party, or any alternatives to the merger. Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion was necessarily\nbased on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available\nto Houlihan Lokey as of, the date thereof. Houlihan Lokey did not undertake, and is under no obligation, to\nupdate, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or\ncoming to Houlihan Lokey\u2019s attention after the date thereof.\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion was furnished for the use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with\nits evaluation of the merger and may not be used for any other purpose without Houlihan Lokey\u2019s prior\nwritten consent. Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion was not intended to be, and did not constitute, a recommendation\nto the Board, any security holder or any other party as to how to act or vote or make any election with\nrespect to any matter relating to the merger or otherwise.\n52 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHoulihan Lokey was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or\notherwise address, among other things: (i) the underlying business decision of the Board, the Company, its\nsecurity holders or any other party to proceed with or effect the merger, (ii) the terms of any arrangements,\nunderstandings, agreements or documents related to, or the form, structure or any other portion or aspect of,\nthe merger or otherwise (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified therein), (iii)\nthe fairness of any portion or aspect of the merger to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company, or to any other party, except if and only to the extent expressly set forth in\nthe last sentence of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion, (iv) the relative merits of the merger as compared to any\nalternative business strategies or transactions that might be available for the Company or any other party,\n(v) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the merger to any one class or group of the Company\u2019s or any\nother party\u2019s security holders or other constituents vis-\u00e0-vis any other class or group of the Company\u2019s or\nsuch other party\u2019s security holders or other constituents (including, without limitation, the fairness of the\namount or the nature of any compensation to any holder of warrants issued by the Company, or any class of\nsuch persons, or the treatment of any such warrants in or adjustments to their terms and conditions resulting\nfrom the merger, relative to the treatment of US Ecology\u2019s common stock or the merger consideration to be\nreceived by the holders of US Ecology\u2019s common stock in the merger, or the allocation of any consideration\namongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents), (vi) whether or not the\nCompany, its security holders or any other party is receiving or paying reasonably equivalent value in the\nmerger, (vii) the solvency, creditworthiness or fair value of the Company or any other participant in the\nmerger, or any of their respective assets, under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,\nfraudulent conveyance or similar matters, or (viii) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount, nature\nor any other aspect of any compensation to or consideration payable to or received by any officers, directors\nor employees of any party to the merger, any class of such persons or any other party, relative to the\nconsideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation was intended in matters that\nrequire legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. It was assumed that\nsuch opinions, counsel or interpretations were or will be obtained from the appropriate professional sources.\nFurthermore, Houlihan Lokey relied, with the consent of the Board, on the assessments by the Board, the\nCompany, and its advisors, as to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax and other similar matters\nwith respect to the Company and the merger or otherwise.\nIn performing its analyses, Houlihan Lokey considered general business, economic, industry and market\nconditions, financial and otherwise, and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the\ndate of its opinion. No company, transaction or business used in Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses for comparative\npurposes is identical to the Company or the proposed merger and an evaluation of the results of those\nanalyses is not entirely mathematical. As a consequence, mathematical derivations (such as the high, low,\nmean and median) of financial data are not by themselves meaningful and in selecting the ranges of multiples\nto be applied were considered in conjunction with experience and the exercise of judgment. The estimates\ncontained in the financial forecasts prepared by the management of the Company and the implied reference\nrange values indicated by Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or\npredictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those\nsuggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or securities\ndo not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold,\nwhich may depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Much of\nthe information used in, and accordingly the results of, Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses are inherently subject to\nsubstantial uncertainty.\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Board in evaluating the proposed\nmerger. Neither Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the consideration or of the\nviews of the Board or management with respect to the merger or the consideration. Under the terms of its\nengagement by the Company, neither Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion nor any other advice or services rendered\nby it in connection with the proposed merger or otherwise, should be construed as creating, and Houlihan\nLokey should not be deemed to have, any fiduciary duty to, or agency relationships with, the Board, the\nCompany, Republic Services, any security holder or creditor of the Company or Republic Services or any\nother person, regardless of any prior or ongoing advice or relationships. The type and amount of\nconsideration payable in the merger were determined through arms\u2019-length negotiation between the\nCompany and Republic Services, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the\nBoard.\n53 \n\u2022 \n- \n- \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFinancial Analyses\nIn preparing its opinion to the Board, Houlihan Lokey performed a variety of analyses, including those\ndescribed below. The summary of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses is not a complete description of the analyses\nunderlying Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion. The preparation of such an opinion is a complex process involving\nvarious quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to the financial, comparative\nand other analytical methods employed and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique\nfacts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Houlihan Lokey\u2019s opinion nor its underlying\nanalyses is readily susceptible to summary description. Houlihan Lokey arrived at its opinion based on the\nresults of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions\nfrom or with regard to any individual analysis, methodology or factor. While the results of each analysis\nwere taken into account in reaching Houlihan Lokey\u2019s overall conclusion with respect to fairness, Houlihan\nLokey did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. Accordingly, Houlihan\nLokey believes that its analyses and the following summary must be considered as a whole and that\nselecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all analyses,\nmethodologies and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s analyses and opinion.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Houlihan Lokey in connection\nwith the preparation of its opinion and reviewed with the Board on February 8, 2022. The order of the\nanalyses does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Houlihan Lokey. The\nanalyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not\nconstitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without\nconsidering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the\nassumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete\nview of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s analyses.\nFor purposes of its analyses, Houlihan Lokey reviewed a number of financial and operating metrics,\nincluding:\nAdjusted EBITDA -\ngenerally, the amount of the relevant company\u2019s EBITDA for a specified time period, adjusted\nfor certain non-recurring items.\nin the case of the Company, for purposes of the analyses summarized below Adjusted EBITDA\ntreats stock-based compensation as a cash expense, and forecasted Adjusted EBITDA\nincludes EBITDA contributions from the Company\u2019s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be\nstarted in fiscal year 2022 and excludes EBITDA contributions from the Company\u2019s ROI\nInitiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024 (for further\ninformation, please refer to \u201cAdjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI)\u201d in the section of this\nProxy Statement entitled \u201cProjected Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 58).\nEBITDA\u202f-\u202fgenerally, the amount of the relevant company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization for a specified time period.\nEnterprise Value\u202f-\u202fgenerally, the value as of a specified date of the relevant company\u2019s outstanding\nequity securities (taking into account outstanding options and other securities convertible,\nexercisable or exchangeable into or for equity securities of the company) plus the amount of its net\ndebt (the amount of its outstanding indebtedness, non-convertible preferred stock, capital lease\nobligations and non-controlling interests less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance\nsheet).\nReturn-on-investment initiatives (\u201cROI Initiatives\u201d)\u202f-\u202frepresents certain specific growth-oriented or\ncost mitigating capital expenditures of the Company that are justified based on their return on\ninvestment.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, enterprise values and equity values used in the selected companies\nanalysis described below were calculated using the closing price of US Ecology\u2019s common stock and the\ncommon stock of the selected companies listed below as of February 4, 2022, and transaction values for the\n54 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nselected transactions analysis described below were calculated on an enterprise value basis based on the\nannounced transaction equity price and other public information available at the time of the announcement.\nThe estimates of the future financial and operating performance of the Company relied upon for the financial\nanalyses described below were based on the Projections. The estimates of the future financial and operating\nperformance of the selected companies listed below were based on certain publicly available research analyst\nestimates for those companies.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis.\u2007\u2007Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the\nCompany, based on the Projections, separately calculating (i) the estimated net present value of the\nprojected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows of the Company on an enterprise basis and the estimated net\npresent value of the terminal value of the Company (in each case, including the Company\u2019s ROI Initiatives\nthat are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2022 and excluding net cash flows from the Company\u2019s ROI\nInitiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024), and (ii) the estimated net\npresent value of the projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows of the Company\u2019s ROI Initiatives that are\nforecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024 and the estimated net present value of the\nterminal value of such ROI Initiatives.\nEnterprise.\u2007\u2007Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company on an enterprise\nbasis by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows of\nthe Company and the estimated net present value of the terminal value of the Company, based on the\nProjections, in each case, including the Company\u2019s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal\nyear 2022 and excluding net cash flows from the Company\u2019s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started\nin fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024\u037e for further information, please refer to \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\n(Enterprise)\u201d in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled \u201cProjected Financial Information\u201d beginning on\npage 58. Houlihan Lokey calculated terminal values for the Company by applying a range of perpetuity\ngrowth rates of 2.5% to 3.0% to the Company\u2019s fiscal year 2026 estimated unlevered, after-tax free cash\nflows. The net present values of the Company\u2019s projected future cash flows and terminal values were then\ncalculated using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5%, based on an estimate of the Company\u2019s weighted\naverage cost of capital, to determine an implied enterprise value reference range.\nROI Initiatives.\u2007\u2007Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company\u2019s ROI\nInitiatives by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected unlevered, after-tax free cash flows\nof the Company\u2019s ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024 and\nthe estimated net present value of the terminal value of such ROI Initiatives, based on the Projections (the\n\u201cROI Initiatives Implied Value\u201d)\u037e for further information, please refer to \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow (ROI)\u201d\nin the section of this Proxy Statement entitled \u201cProjected Financial Information\u201d beginning on page 58.\nHoulihan Lokey calculated terminal values for such ROI Initiatives by applying a range of perpetuity growth\nrates of 2.5% to 3.0% to such ROI Initiatives\u2019 fiscal year 2026 normalized unlevered, after-tax free cash flows.\nThe net present values of such ROI Initiatives\u2019 projected future cash flows and terminal values were then\ncalculated using discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 12.0%, based on an estimate of the cost of equity of (i)\nthe Company and (ii) the selected companies listed below, to determine an implied value.\nHoulihan Lokey then added the implied enterprise value reference range from the discounted cash flow\nanalysis of the Company on an enterprise basis and the ROI Initiatives Implied Value, to determine a total\nimplied enterprise value reference range for the Company. Houlihan Lokey then subtracted total debt and\nadded cash and cash equivalents, the book value of the Company\u2019s long-term investments, as provided by\nCompany management and each as of December 31, 2021, and the present value of the expected tax savings\nfrom the Company\u2019s net operating losses, as provided by Company management (calculated assuming a\nfederal tax rate of 21.0% and using a discount rate range of 11.0% to 12.0%, based on an estimate of the\nCompany\u2019s cost of equity), to derive an implied equity value reference range for the Company. The figures in\nthe implied equity value reference range were then divided by the number of fully diluted shares of US\nEcology common stock outstanding to calculate a reference range of implied equity values per share. The\ndiscounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value reference range of $43.64\u202f-\u202f$60.63,\nas compared to the proposed merger consideration of $48.00 per share in cash.\nSelected Companies Analysis.\u2007\u2007Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain data for selected companies with publicly\ntraded equity securities that, based on its professional judgment and experience, Houlihan Lokey deemed\nrelevant with respect to its analysis of the Company.\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe financial data reviewed included:\nEnterprise value as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2021 adjusted EBITDA, or \u201cCY 2021E\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d\u037e\nEnterprise value as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2022 adjusted EBITDA, or \u201cCY 2022E\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d\u037e and\nEnterprise value as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2023 adjusted EBITDA, or \u201cCY 2023E\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d.\nThe selected companies included the following:\nClean Harbors, Inc.\nHarsco Corporation\nHeritage-Crystal Clean, Inc.\u037e and\nStericycle, Inc.\nThe resulting data were as follows:\nEnterprise Value Multiples\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nEnterprise Value Multiples\nFinancial Metric\nLow\nHigh\nMedian\nMean\nCY 2021E Adjusted EBITDA\n6.1x\n15.4x\n9.8x\n10.3x\nCY 2022E Adjusted EBITDA\n7.2x\n14.7x\n9.1x\n10.0x\nCY 2023E Adjusted EBITDA\n7.2x\n12.7x\n8.6x\n9.3x\nTaking into account the results of the selected companies analysis, Houlihan Lokey applied the selected\nmultiple ranges set forth in the table below to corresponding financial data for the Company based on the\nProjections, to calculate an implied enterprise value reference range.

Houlihan Lokey is regularly engaged to provide financial\nadvisory services in connection with mergers and acquisitions, financings, and financial restructurings.\nPursuant to its engagement by the Company, Houlihan Lokey is entitled to an aggregate fee for its services\nof approximately $16.7 million, $1.5 million of which became payable contingent upon the delivery of\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s opinion and the balance of which will become payable upon the consummation of the\nmerger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Houlihan Lokey for certain expenses and to indemnify\nHoulihan Lokey, its affiliates and certain related parties against certain liabilities and expenses, including\ncertain liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of or related to Houlihan Lokey\u2019s engagement.\n57 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn the ordinary course of business, certain of Houlihan Lokey\u2019s employees and affiliates, as well as\ninvestment funds in which they may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may acquire,\nhold or sell, long or short positions, or trade, in debt, equity, and other securities and financial instruments\n(including loans and other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company or any other party that may be\ninvolved in the merger and their respective affiliates or security holders or any currency or commodity that\nmay be involved in the merger.\nHoulihan Lokey and/or certain of its affiliates have in the past provided and are currently providing\ninvestment banking, financial advisory and/or other financial or consulting services to the Company for\nwhich Houlihan Lokey and/or its affiliates have received, and may receive, compensation. In this regard,\nHoulihan Lokey and/or its affiliates have in the past provided and currently are providing valuation advisory\nservices to the Company for financial reporting purposes, for which services Houlihan Lokey and its\naffiliates have received aggregate fees from the Company during the two years prior to the date of Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s opinion of approximately $560,000. During the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Houlihan\nLokey and/or certain of its affiliates have also provided investment banking, financial advisory and/or other\nfinancial or consulting services to certain affiliates of Republic Services, for which Houlihan Lokey and/or its\naffiliates have received compensation in an amount less than $3 million. Houlihan Lokey and certain of its\naffiliates may provide investment banking, financial advisory and/or other financial or consulting services to\nthe Company, Republic Services, other participants in the merger or certain of their respective affiliates or\nsecurity holders in the future, for which Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates may receive compensation.\nFurthermore, in connection with bankruptcies, restructurings, distressed situations and similar matters,\nHoulihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates may have in the past acted, may currently be acting and may in\nthe future act as financial advisor to debtors, creditors, equity holders, trustees, agents and other interested\nparties (including, without limitation, formal and informal committees or groups of creditors) that may have\nincluded or represented and may include or represent, directly or indirectly, or may be or have been adverse\nto, the Company, Republic Services, other participants in the merger or certain of their respective affiliates or\nsecurity holders, for which advice and services Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates have received and may\nreceive compensation.\nProjected Financial Information\nUS Ecology has not historically publicly disclosed long-term projections as to future financial performance\ndue to, among other reasons, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates, though US\nEcology has in the past provided investors with full-fiscal year financial guidance on certain financial\nmetrics, including total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, which are updated when\nnecessary during the relevant fiscal year, and five year growth targets for certain financial measures.\nHowever, in connection with the evaluation of the proposed merger, US Ecology\u2019s senior management\nshared certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by it for strategic planning\npurposes with the Board, Republic Services and the Co-Financial Advisors, for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2022 and the four following fiscal years ending 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively (which\nwe refer to as the \u201cProjections\u201d).\nThe Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this Proxy Statement\nonly because such information was made available to the Board, Republic Services and the Co-Financial\nAdvisors as described above. The Projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with generally\naccepted accounting principles as applied in the United States (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d), the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective\nfinancial information. The prospective financial information included in this Proxy Statement has been\nprepared by, and is the responsibility of, US Ecology\u2019s senior management, and is subjective in many\nrespects. The Projections were, in the view of US Ecology\u2019s senior management, prepared on a reasonable\nbasis, reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation, and presented as of the\ntime of preparation, to the best of senior management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action\nand the expected future financial performance of US Ecology on a standalone basis, subject to the\nassumptions and limitations described in this section. Furthermore, neither US Ecology\u2019s independent\nauditors nor any other independent accountants have audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied\n58 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nagreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective financial information and,\naccordingly, assume no responsibility for, and express no opinion or other form of assurance on, such\ninformation or its achievability.\nThe Projections are forward-looking statements. Except as specifically noted in this \u201cProjected Financial\nInformation\u201d section of this Proxy Statement, although summaries of the Projections are presented with\nnumerical specificity, the Projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made\nby US Ecology\u2019s senior management, which it believes were reasonable at the time the Projections were\nprepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at such time. However, this\ninformation is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily predictive of actual future results.\nImportant factors may affect actual results and cause the forecasts not to be achieved. These factors include\ngeneral economic conditions, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, timing of business investments\nby US Ecology, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, changes in tax or other\nlaws or regulations, and the other factors described in the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d section of this Proxy\nStatement, the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in US Ecology\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the information referenced in\nthe \u201cAdditional Information and Where to Find It\u201d section of this Proxy Statement.\nGenerally, the further out the period to which the Projections relate, the less predictable and more unreliable\nthe information becomes. In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events\noccurring after the date that the Projections were prepared. Furthermore, the Projections were prepared on a\nstandalone basis without giving effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the\nMerger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger,\nincluding the expenses payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the potential synergies that may be\nachieved as a result of the merger, or the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been\nor will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the\nprojections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the\nProjections. The inclusion of this information in the Proxy Statement should not be regarded as an indication\nthat US Ecology\u2019s senior management, the Board, the Co-Financial Advisors, Republic Services or any other\nrecipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Projections to be material information of US\nEcology, or necessarily predictive of actual future results, nor should it be construed as financial guidance,\nand it should not be relied upon as such. The summary of the Projections is not included in this Proxy\nStatement in order to induce any stockholder to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the\nnon-binding advisory proposal on merger-related compensation or the adjournment proposal or to influence\nany stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to\nseek appraisal rights with respect to the shares of US Ecology common stock.\nThe Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and\nother information regarding US Ecology contained in US Ecology\u2019s public filings with the SEC. The\nProjections were prepared by US Ecology\u2019s senior management with, and considered and approved by, the\nBoard in connection with its evaluation and approval of the merger and were relied upon by the Co-Financial\nAdvisors for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions, as described more fully in the\n\u201cReasons for Recommendation\u201d and \u201cOpinions of Financial Advisors\u201d sections of this Proxy Statement.\nExcept to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim\nany responsibility to update or otherwise revise the forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date\nwhen we prepared the Projections or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general\neconomic or industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the Projections\nare shown to be in error. We can give no assurance that, had our Projections been prepared either as of the\ndate of the Merger Agreement or as of the date of this Proxy Statement, similar estimates and assumptions\nwould be used. Neither US Ecology nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, advisors or other\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any of our stockholders or any other person\nregarding the ultimate performance of US Ecology compared to the information contained in our Projections\nor that our Projections will be achieved.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections and considering that the\nSpecial Meeting will be held several months after the Projections were prepared, stockholders are cautioned\nnot to place undue reliance on the Projections included in this Proxy Statement.\n59 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain of the measures included in the Projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as\nnoted below. These non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and management in understanding\ncurrent profitability levels and liquidity that may serve as a basis for evaluating future performance and\nfacilitating comparability of results. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation\nfrom, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures as used by US Ecology may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other\ncompanies. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the forecasts were relied upon by the Co-Financial\nAdvisors for purposes of their respective financial analyses and opinions and by the Board in connection\nwith its consideration of the merger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from the\ndefinition of non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures\nof non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to a GAAP financial measure.\nSummary of the Projections\nExcept as specifically noted in this \u201cProjected Financial Information\u201d section of this Proxy Statement, the\nfollowing is a summary of the Projections prepared by senior management of US Ecology and provided to its\nBoard, the Co-Financial Advisors and Republic Services prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement\n(amounts may reflect rounding):\n($ in millions)\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\nRevenue\n1,040\n1,123\n1,224\n1,297\n1,373\nAdjusted EBITDA\n181\n224\n268\n294\n320\nAdjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI)\n174\n214\n252\n274\n299\nUnlevered Cash Flows\n66\n77\n104\n135\n167\nUnlevered Free Cash Flows (Enterprise)\n62\n87\n114\n118\n151\nUnlevered Free Cash Flows (ROI)\n0\n(15\n(17\n9\n9\nCapEx\n97\n93\n91\n82\n75\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, means net (loss) income from continuing operations adjusted\nfor interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure,\nmeans EBITDA adjusted to exclude non-cash and non-recurring items, as well as other adjustments\npermitted in calculating covenant compliance under the agreements governing US Ecology\u2019s\noutstanding debt securities and credit facilities. US Ecology excludes acquisition and development\ncosts and stock-based compensation in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. US Ecology believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to evaluate performance because it eliminates the effects of financing and\nincome taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as certain items that are not\nindicative of US Ecology\u2019s performance on an ongoing basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI), a non-GAAP financial measure, means Adjusted EBITDA\nless stock-based compensation expense and the EBITDA contribution from ROI Initiatives that are\nforecasted to be started in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2024. The measure of Adjusted EBITDA\n(excluding SBC and ROI) was calculated by Houlihan Lokey based on information provided by US\nEcology\u2019s senior management as set forth in the Projections, and was reviewed and approved by US\nEcology\u2019s senior management for Houlihan Lokey\u2019s use in connection with its financial analyses\ndescribed in the section entitled \u201cOpinions of Financial Advisors\u202f-\u202fOpinion and Financial Analyses of\nHoulihan Lokey\u201d beginning on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.\nUnlevered Cash Flows is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by Barclays as Adjusted EBITDA\nless expenses, cash taxes and capital expenditures and adjusted for changes in working capital, in each\ncase, as set forth in the Projections. The measure of Unlevered Cash Flows was reviewed and approved\nby US Ecology\u2019s senior management for Barclays\u2019 use in connection with its illustrative discounted\ncash flows analyses described in the section entitled \u201cOpinions of Financial Advisors\u202f-\u202fOpinion and\nFinancial Analyses of Barclays\u201d beginning on page 43 of this Proxy Statement.\n60 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n)\n)\n(6)\n(4) \n(5) \n(6) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnlevered Free Cash Flows (Enterprise) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by Houlihan Lokey\nas Adjusted EBITDA (excluding SBC and ROI), less business development expense, less depreciation,\namortization and accretion expense, less taxes, plus depreciation, amortization and accretion expense,\nless closing and post-closing payments, less capital expenditures and adjusted for changes in working\ncapital, in each case based on information provided by US Ecology senior management as set forth in\nthe Projections, and was reviewed and approved by US Ecology senior management for Houlihan\nLokey\u2019s use in connection with its financial analyses described in the section entitled \u201cOpinions of\nFinancial Advisors\u202f-\u202fOpinion and Financial Analyses of Houlihan Lokey\u201d beginning on page 51 of this Proxy\nStatement.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flows (ROI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by Houlihan Lokey as the\ntax-effected EBITDA contribution from ROI Initiatives that are forecasted to be started in fiscal year\n2023 or fiscal year 2024, plus depreciation expense, less capital expenditures, in each case based on\ninformation provided by US Ecology\u2019s senior management as set forth in the Projections, and was\nreviewed and approved by US Ecology\u2019s senior management for Houlihan Lokey\u2019s use in connection\nwith its financial analyses described in the section entitled \u201cOpinions of Financial Advisors\u202f-\u202fOpinion and\nFinancial Analyses of Houlihan Lokey\u201d beginning on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.\nCapEx means capital expenditures for maintenance activities including equipment replacement,\ninfrastructure improvements and other routine capital projects, landfill airspace expansion and growth\ncapital from ROI Initiatives that are expected to result in increased revenue or reduced expenses.\nTreatment of US Ecology Warrants in the Merger\nUS Ecology warrants are currently registered under the Exchange Act, and are listed on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbol \u201cECOLW.\u201d At the effective time, in accordance with the terms of each warrant\nissued pursuant to that certain Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to the Warrant Agreement between\nthe Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, dated November 1, 2019, Republic Services will\ncause the surviving corporation to issue a replacement warrant to each holder thereof that complies with and\nsatisfies the applicable terms and conditions of the Warrant Agreement, providing that such replacement\nwarrant shall be exercisable for an amount in cash, without interest, determined in accordance with the\nWarrant Agreement. For more information, please see \u201cQuestions and Answers\u202f-\u202fWhat effects will the merger\nhave on the US Ecology warrants?\u201d\nFollowing the consummation of the merger, US Ecology warrants will be de-listed from the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket and deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nInterests of US Ecology Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation by the Board that US Ecology stockholders vote to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of US Ecology have\ncertain interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of US Ecology\nstockholders generally. The members of the Board and US Ecology\u2019s management team were aware of these\ninterests in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, considering the merger and, in the case of the\nBoard, in recommending that US Ecology stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. These interests may\npresent such directors and executive officers with actual or potential conflicts of interest and these interests\nare described in this section.\nThe interests of the persons who are directors or executive officers of US Ecology are discussed below. The\nexecutive officers of US Ecology are also US Ecology\u2019s named executive officers.\nTreatment of US Ecology Equity Awards in the Merger\nTreatment of Stock Options - At the effective time of the merger, each Company stock option with an exercise\nprice per share of US Ecology common stock less than $48.00 that is outstanding immediately prior to the\neffective time, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part\nof the holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of such\nCompany stock option to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable\nwithholding or other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the\nnumber\n61 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof shares of US Ecology common stock subject to the Company stock option multiplied by (ii) the excess of\n$48.00 over the per-share exercise price of such Company stock option. Each Company stock option\noutstanding as of the effective time that is not canceled as described in the preceding sentence, whether\nvested or unvested (including 206,363 Company stock options held by directors and officers of the Company\nwith per-share exercise prices of $48.00 or greater), shall, at the effective time, automatically be cancelled\nwithout any consideration paid to the holder thereof.\nTreatment of Performance Stock Unit Awards - At the effective time, each performance stock unit award that\nis outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, automatically and without any required action on\nthe part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of\nsuch performance stock unit to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable\nwithholding or other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the\nnumber of shares of US Ecology common stock equal to the greater of (a) the target number of shares of US\nEcology common stock with respect to such performance stock unit as defined and set forth in the applicable\naward agreement and (b) the number of shares of US Ecology common stock determined based upon the\nactual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior to the effective time, as reasonably\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee of the Board prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) $48.00.\nTreatment of Restricted Stock Unit Awards - At the effective time, each restricted stock unit award\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall, automatically and without any required action on\nthe part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of\nsuch restricted stock unit award to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable\nwithholding or other taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the\nnumber of shares of US Ecology common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award multiplied by (ii)\n$48.00.\nTreatment of Restricted Share Awards - At the effective time, each restricted share award that is outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the\nholder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of such restricted\nshare award to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or\nother taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld) equal to (i) the number of shares of\nUS Ecology common stock subject to such restricted share award multiplied by (ii) $48.00.\nAbsent the prior written consent of Republic Services, US Ecology is not permitted to grant stock options,\nperformance stock units, restricted stock units or other equity or equity-based awards prior to closing.\nNotwithstanding the above, to the extent that the closing has not occurred by March 31, 2023, US Ecology\nmay grant equity awards in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. However, any such post-\nMarch 31, 2023 awards will not vest upon closing but will be converted into equity awards of equivalent\nvalue of Republic Services.\nTreatment of 2022 Annual Bonuses\nUnder the Merger Agreement, following the closing, to the extent not paid prior to the closing, Republic\nServices is required to pay, or cause one of its affiliates to pay, bonuses under the Company\u2019s annual bonus\nprogram for the 2022 performance year, determined and payable based on the greater of (i) actual\nperformance and (ii) 80% of the target level achievement.\nProspects of Continued Employment\nExecutive officers of US Ecology, in negotiating the Merger Agreement on behalf of US Ecology, would have\nbeen aware that, if the Merger Agreement were to be adopted by US Ecology\u2019s stockholders and the merger\nwere to be effected, following the closing, Republic Services would be the ultimate employer of US Ecology\u2019s\ncurrent employees and would have discretion to decide whether to continue to retain or to grant any\nadditional salary or benefits to any particular employee. Republic Services communicated to Jeffrey R. Feeler,\nthe Company\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, in the course of the arms\u2019-length\nnegotiations between US Ecology and Republic Services, that there would likely not be a long-term role for\nMr. Feeler at the surviving company following the closing.\n62 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEmployment Agreements\nUS Ecology is party to an employment agreement with each of its executive officers, who are also US\nEcology\u2019s named executive officers. Each of these employment agreements provides for severance payable\nto the executive officer in connection with a qualifying termination of employment, which is a termination\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or resignation for \u201cgood reason,\u201d as defined in the applicable employment agreement, as\nwell as in connection with a change in control event and a subsequent qualifying termination of employment\nwithin 24 months after such change in control.\nGenerally, in the event of a qualifying termination that occurs within 24 months following the closing of the\ntransaction, each of the executive officers would be entitled under his employment agreement to the\nfollowing:\nA lump sum payment equal to two times (or three times, in the case of Mr. Feeler) the sum of (i) base\nsalary\u037e and (ii) the greater of (a) any earned but unpaid amount due under any cash incentive plan\nand (b) the executive officer\u2019s target incentive amount under a cash incentive plan\u037e\nReimbursement of medical, dental and vision insurance premiums pursuant to COBRA for a period up\nto 18 months\u037e\n6 (or 18, in the case of Mr. Feeler) monthly payments, each in an amount equal to the greater of (i)\n$5,000 and (ii) two times the monthly COBRA medical, dental and vision insurance premiums as of the\ntermination date, commencing on the 18-month anniversary of the termination date\u037e\n24 (or 36, in the case of Mr. Feeler) monthly cash payments each equal to two times the monthly\npremiums as of the termination date under the Company\u2019s life insurance and long-term disability\ninsurance plans\u037e\nIn the case of Mr. Feeler only, up to 12 consecutive months of outplacement services not to exceed\n$100,000 in the aggregate (such benefits to end no later than the third anniversary of the termination\ndate)\u037e\nFull vesting of all unvested stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock\nunits (but only to the extent granted after the effective date of the employment agreement),\nperformance stock units (but only to the extent not subject to Code Section 409A or, if subject to\nCode Section 409A, only to the extent granted after the effective date of the employment agreement)\nand performance stock (with performance with respect to performance-based awards to be deemed\nachieved at target)\u037e and\nContinued vesting of any restricted stock units and performance stock units subject to Code Section\n409A, in each case, outstanding on the effective date of the employment agreement, in the same\nmanner as if no termination of employment occurred (with payment based on target performance).\nThe employment agreements do not provide for these payments and benefits to the executive officers\nimmediately upon the closing of the transaction (i.e., on a \u201csingle trigger\u201d basis). Instead, the employment\nagreements provide for these payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment that\noccurs within 24 months following the closing of the transaction. Payment of these amounts is subject to the\nexecution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form provided by the Company and the\nexecutive officer\u2019s compliance with the confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-disparagement restrictive\ncovenants contained in the employment agreements.\nSummary of Potential Transaction Payments to Executive Officers and Directors of US Ecology\nThe following table indicates the dollar amounts potentially payable to US Ecology\u2019s executive officers, who\nare also US Ecology\u2019s named executive officers, and directors under the compensation arrangements\ndescribed above upon the effective time of the merger, assuming the effective time of the merger occurs on\nJune 30, 2022 and a contemporaneous qualifying termination of employment occurs.\n63 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMerger-Related Compensation Table\nExecutive Officer\nCash\nEquity\nPerquisites/\u200b\nBenefits\nTotal\nJeffrey R.

This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), applicable Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code,\nadministrative interpretations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings as in effect as of the date of this\nProxy Statement, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is for the general\ninformation of the holders of shares of US Ecology common stock only and does not purport to be a\ncomplete analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger.\nThis discussion addresses only the consequences of the exchange of shares of US Ecology common stock\nheld as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for\ninvestment). It does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a US\nEcology stockholder in light of the US Ecology stockholder\u2019s particular circumstances, or to a US Ecology\nstockholder that is subject to special rules, such as:\nA bank, insurance company, or other financial institution\u037e\n65 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA tax-exempt organization\u037e\nA dealer or broker in securities or non-U.S. currencies\u037e\nA trader in securities who elects the mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\nAn individual subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code\u037e\nA mutual fund\u037e\nA U.S. expatriate or former citizen or long-term resident of the United States\u037e\nA foreign pension fund and its affiliates\u037e\nA person whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\nA former citizen or former long-term resident of the United States\u037e\nA real estate investment trust or regulated investment company\u037e\nA US Ecology stockholder that holds its shares of US Ecology common stock through individual\nretirement or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e\nA US Ecology stockholder that exercises appraisal rights\u037e\nA US Ecology stockholder that holds shares of US Ecology common stock as part of a hedge,\nappreciated financial position, straddle, or conversion or integrated transaction\u037e\nA US Ecology stockholder that acquired shares of US Ecology common stock through the exercise of\ncompensatory options or stock purchase plans or otherwise as compensation\u037e or\nA US Ecology stockholder that is required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income\nwith respect to the merger as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial\nstatement.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of US Ecology common stock\nthat is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nAn individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\nA corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state therein or the District of Columbia\u037e\nAn estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\nA trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the\nsubstantial decisions of which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid\nelection in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of US Ecology common stock that is neither a U.S. holder\nnor a partnership (nor an entity treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes) holds shares of US Ecology common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in\nthe partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A\npartner in a partnership holding shares of US Ecology common stock should consult its tax advisors.\nThis discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is not a complete\ndescription of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion does not\naddress tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it\ndoes not address any U.S. state or local or any non-U.S. tax consequences of the merger or the potential\napplication of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. Accordingly, each US Ecology\nstockholder should consult its tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S.\nincome or other tax consequences to it of the merger.\nThis discussion does not address any tax consequences of the merger arising under the laws of any state,\nlocal or foreign jurisdiction or U.S. federal laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws and does not\n66 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naddress tax considerations applicable to holders who exercise appraisal rights or to persons who hold US\nEcology stock options, performance stock unit awards, restricted share unit awards, warrants or other rights\nto acquire an equity interest in the Company.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders - The receipt of the merger consideration by U.S.\nholders pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general,\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder will recognize taxable capital gain or loss in an amount\nequal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) such U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of US Ecology common stock exchanged therefor. A U.S. holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in a particular share of US Ecology common stock generally will equal the price the U.S.\nholder paid for such share of US Ecology common stock.\nIf a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period in the shares of US Ecology common stock surrendered in the merger is\ngreater than one year as of the completion of the merger, the capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain\nor loss. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject\nto U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of a capital loss recognized in connection\nwith the merger is subject to limitations under the Code. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares\nof US Ecology common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its\nadjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares of US Ecology common\nstock that it holds.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to non-U.S. Holders - The receipt of the merger consideration by a\nnon-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\nThe gain, if any, recognized by the non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with a trade or business\nof the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is\nattributable to the non-U.S. holder\u2019s permanent establishment in the United States)\u037e\nThe non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the merger and certain other conditions are met\u037e or\nThe non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more\nthan 5% of US Ecology common stock at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding the\nmerger, and US Ecology is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the\nmeaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the\nshorter of the five (5)-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held the\nshares of US Ecology common stock.\nGain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax on a net income basis in the same manner\nas if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise).\nAdditionally, any gain described in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also\nmay be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable\nincome tax treaty). A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to tax at a\nrate of 30% (or a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty) on any capital gain realized, which\nmay be offset by U.S.-source capital losses recognized in the same taxable year. If the third bullet point\nabove applies to a non-U.S. holder, capital gain recognized by such holder will be subject to tax at generally\napplicable U.S. federal income tax rates. We believe that we are not, and we do not anticipate becoming, a\n\u201cUnited States real property holding corporation.\u201d However, because the determination of whether we are a\n\u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d depends on the fair market value of our United States real\nproperty interests relative to the fair market value of our global real property interests and other business\nassets, there can be no assurance that we do not currently constitute or will not become a \u201cUnited States\nreal property holding corporation.\u201d Non-U.S. holders owning (actually or constructively) more than 5% of\nUS Ecology common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the merger.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting - Payments of cash made in exchange for shares of US\nEcology common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information\nreporting and backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not otherwise\nestablish an exemption should complete and return an IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of\n67 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperjury that such U.S. holder is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d  (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer\nidentification number provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding. To\navoid backup withholding, a non-U.S. holder is required to establish an exemption, for example, by\ncompleting and providing to the applicable withholding agent the appropriate IRS Form W-8 for the non-U.S.\nholder, in accordance with the instructions thereto.\nAny amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against the\nU.S. federal income tax liability of a US Ecology stockholder, provided the required information is timely\nfurnished to the IRS. The IRS may impose a penalty upon an US Ecology stockholder that fails to provide\nthe correct taxpayer identification number.\nRegulatory Clearances\nRequired Approvals - Under the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot be completed until any applicable\nwaiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR\nAct\u201d) has expired or been terminated. US Ecology and Republic Services made the necessary filings with the\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d)\non February 28, 2022.\nEven after the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act expires or is terminated, the FTC and the\nAntitrust Division of the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before or\nafter the merger is completed. Likewise, at any time before or after the consummation of the merger, a U.S.\nstate or a foreign governmental authority with jurisdiction over the parties could take such action under\nantitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\nconsummation of the merger, to rescind the merger or to seek divestiture of particular assets. Private parties\nalso may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. Neither US Ecology\nnor Republic Services can provide assurance that any action under antitrust laws will not result in the delay\nor abandonment of the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement also provides that the merger cannot be completed until the following regulatory\napprovals, in addition to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act,\nhave been received:\nAll necessary approvals under any antitrust and foreign direct investment laws applicable to the\nmerger (including the requisite approval of the Turkish Competition Authority, which has been\nreceived)\u037e and\nAny necessary approval or written non-objection by the State of Washington in connection with the\ntransfer of (i) Radioactive Materials License WN-I019-2 issued by the Washington State Department\nof Health and (ii) US Ecology\u2019s Sublease with the Washington Department of Ecology, in each case,\nin connection with US Ecology\u2019s site activities in Hanford, Washington or operations in Richland,\nWashington.\nCommitments to Obtain Regulatory Approvals - The parties to the Merger Agreement must, and must cause\ntheir respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain and to cooperate in\nobtaining any regulatory approvals required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the\nMerger Agreement and as required to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.\nUS Ecology and Republic Services have agreed to:\nCause, and cause their respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to\nobtain and to cooperate in obtaining any regulatory approvals required in connection with the\nexecution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement and as required to consummate the\ntransactions contemplated hereby\nCause, and cause their respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to\nvigorously oppose any challenge instituted or threatened by a government entity or private party,\nunder the HSR Act or any other antitrust law, asserted with respect to the Merger or any other\ntransaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement\n68 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSell or divest assets (belonging to Republic Services or US Ecology or any of their respective\nsubsidiaries) if required in order to obtain antitrust approval.\nHowever, Republic Services is not required to sell assets that would, individually or in the aggregate, reduce\nthe aggregate annual revenue of Republic Services and its subsidiaries (including US Ecology and its\nsubsidiaries) after giving effect to the closing by more than $60,000,000 in total sales (based on total sales of\nthe year ended December 31, 2021) (any such individual action or combination of actions, a \u201cBurdensome\nCondition\u201d) (as more fully described in the \u201cEfforts to Complete the Merger\u037e Regulatory Approvals\u201d section of\nthis Proxy Statement).\nDe-listing and De-registration of US Ecology Common Stock\nIf the merger is completed, US Ecology common stock and warrants will be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-\nregistered under the Exchange Act. As such, following the completion of the merger, US Ecology will no\nlonger file periodic reports with the SEC.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nCommencing on March 15, 2022, purported individual stockholders of US Ecology filed complaints in the\nUnited States District Courts for the Southern District of New York, for the Eastern District of New York, and\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in the matters captioned Ryan O\u2019Dell v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No.\n22-cv-2131 (S.D.N.Y., filed Mar. 15, 2022) (\u201cO\u2019Dell\u201d), Ray Pizzaro v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No. 22-cv-02144\n(S.D.N.Y., filed Mar. 15, 2022) (\u201cPizzaro\u201d), Matthew Whitfield v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No. 22-cv-01515\n(E.D.N.Y., filed Mar. 18, 2022) (\u201cWhitfield\u201d), Lewis D. Baker v. US Ecology, Inc., et al, No. 22-cv-01053 (E.D.\nPa., filed Mar. 18, 2022) (\u201cBaker\u201d), and Teresa McCurdy v. US Ecology, Inc. et al, No. 22-cv-01685 (E.D.N.Y.,\nfiled Mar. 25, 2022) (\u201cMcCurdy,\u201d and together, the \u201cTransaction Litigation\u201d). The complaints in the\nTransaction Litigation name as defendants the Company and the members of the Board.\nThe complaints in the Transaction Litigation generally allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed by US\nEcology with the SEC on March 11, 2022, in connection with the Merger Agreement is materially incomplete\nand misleading by allegedly failing to disclose purportedly material information relating to the sale process\nleading to the proposed transaction, the Company\u2019s financial projections, and the analyses performed by the\nCo-Financial Advisors. Each of the Complaints asserts violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, Rule\n14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. In addition, the complaint in the\nPizzaro action also asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty by the members of the Board in connection\nwith the approval of the Merger Agreement and the disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement, and a\nclaim against US Ecology for aiding and abetting the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The Transaction\nLitigation seeks, among other things, an injunction of the proposed transaction, rescission of the Merger\nAgreement, a declaratory judgment that the Company and the Board violated the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-\n9 promulgated thereunder, damages, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, and any other relief the court\nmay deem just and proper.\nWhile US Ecology cannot predict the outcome of each Transaction Litigation, US Ecology believes that the\ncases are without merit and US Ecology and its directors intend to defend vigorously against the\nTransaction Litigation.\nIt is possible that additional similar complaints could be filed in connection with the proposed transaction. If\nadditional similar complaints are filed, absent new or significantly different allegations, US Ecology will not\nnecessarily disclose such additional complaints or filings.\nIn addition to the Transaction Litigation, the Company has received letters from three purported\nstockholders of the Company demanding additional disclosures related to the Company's financial\nprojections and the analyses performed by the Co-Financial Advisors.\n69 \n",

This\nsummary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger\nAgreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety\ncarefully, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the\nMerger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this Proxy Statement.\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe following summary of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 8, 2022, by and among\nUS Ecology, Republic Services and Merger Sub and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached to this\nProxy Statement as Annex A, are intended only to provide information regarding the terms of the Merger\nAgreement. The Merger Agreement and the related summary are not intended to be a source of factual,\nbusiness or operational information about US Ecology, Republic Services or Merger Sub, and the following\nsummary of the Merger Agreement and the copy thereof included as Annex A are not intended to modify or\nsupplement any factual disclosure about US Ecology in any documents US Ecology has or will publicly file\nwith the SEC. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by, and covenants of, US\nEcology, Republic Services and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and\nas of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made\nsolely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by\nthe contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of\nallocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect\napplicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition,\ninformation concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the\nMerger Agreement may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may\nor may not be fully reflected in US Ecology\u2019s public disclosures. Until the effective time, stockholders are not\nthird-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement (and after the effective time, stockholders will be third-\nparty beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement solely to the extent necessary to receive the merger\nconsideration due to such persons under the Merger Agreement).\nAdditional information about US Ecology may be found elsewhere in this Proxy Statement and in US\nEcology\u2019s other public filings. See the \u201cAdditional Information and Where to Find It\u201d section of this Proxy\nStatement.\nStructure of the Merger\u037e Certificate of Incorporation\u037e Bylaws\u037e Directors and Officers\nThe Merger Agreement provides that at the effective time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub\nwill cease, and US Ecology will continue as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nRepublic Services. At the effective time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and\nfranchises of US Ecology and Merger Sub will vest in US Ecology as the surviving company and, pursuant\nto the DGCL, all debts, liabilities and duties of US Ecology and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities\nand duties of US Ecology as the surviving company. At the effective time, the certificate of incorporation of\nUS Ecology will be amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form of an exhibit to the Merger\nAgreement and, as so amended and restated, such certificate of incorporation will be the certificate of\nincorporation of the surviving company and the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the\neffective time will be the bylaws of the surviving company, in each case, until subsequently amended.\nThe directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will become the initial directors of the\nsurviving company and the officers of US Ecology immediately prior to the effective time will become the\ninitial officers of the surviving company. The initial directors and officers will hold office until their\nrespective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death,\nresignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving\ncompany.\n70 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nClosing of the Merger\nThe closing will take place on the third business day following the day on which the conditions to the\nmerger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the\nsatisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of those conditions at the closing) have\nbeen satisfied or waived in accordance with the Merger Agreement or at such other time, date and place as\nUS Ecology and Republic Services may agree in writing.\nOn the closing date, Republic Services and US Ecology will cause a certificate of merger to be executed and\nfiled with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the\nDGCL and will make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The merger will become effective\nat the time the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on\nsuch later date and time as may be agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger.\nEffect of the Merger on US Ecology Common Stock\nAt the effective time, each share of US Ecology common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to\nthe effective time (other than Excluded Shares) will be converted automatically into the right to receive the\nmerger consideration, and upon conversion, will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Each\nshare of US Ecology common stock owned by Republic Services, US Ecology (whether held in treasury or\notherwise), or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of US Ecology or Republic Services (including\nMerger Sub) will cease to exist at the effective time and will be cancelled without payment of any\nconsideration. Each share of US Ecology common stock owned by stockholders who will have neither voted\nin favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented thereto in writing with respect to such shares\nand who will have demanded and properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in accordance\nwith Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to the rights granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL (as\nfurther described in the \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d section of this Proxy Statement).\nAt the effective time, each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to\nthe effective time of the merger will be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and\nnonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving company and such shares\nwill constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving company immediately following\nthe effective time.\nPayment Procedures\nPrior to the effective time, Republic Services will appoint a paying agent (the \u201cpaying agent\u201d) to act as the\npaying agent for the US Ecology stockholders in connection with the merger.

prevent the\nconditions to closing from being satisfied prior to August 8, 2023 or, if curable, that has not\nbeen cured after 30 days\u2019 prior written notice from US Ecology.\nIf the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination rights summarized above in this\nsection, the Merger Agreement will become void and of no further force or effect and there will be no liability\nor obligation on the part of any party, except for the confidentiality provisions, provisions relating to the\neffect of termination (including the termination fees described in the \u201cTermination Fee\u201d section of this Proxy\nStatement) and certain other specified general provisions of the Merger Agreement, each of which will\nsurvive the termination of the Merger Agreement.\nTermination Fee\nUnder the Merger Agreement, US Ecology is required to pay Republic Services a termination fee in the\namount of $46,253,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the applicable party under the following\nspecified circumstances:\nIf Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement because there has been a material willful\nbreach by US Ecology of the \u201cno shop\u201d covenant\u037e\nIf Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement because the Board has changed its\nrecommendation in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement prior to obtaining the US Ecology\nstockholder approval at the Special Meeting or US Ecology has approved or adopted, or\nrecommended the approval or adoption of, any alternative acquisition agreement\u037e\nIf US Ecology terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into a transaction that constitutes a Superior\nProposal prior to its receipt of the requisite Company stockholder vote\u037e or\nIf US Ecology or Republic Services terminates the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances and, in\nany such case, prior to such termination, a Takeover Proposal by a third-party shall have been\npublicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn and within 12 months following the date of\ntermination, US Ecology shall have entered into a definitive written agreement with respect to an\nalternative acquisition transaction (whether or not relating to a Takeover Proposal made,\ncommunication or publicly disclosed prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement).\nIn the event that US Ecology fails to pay in a timely manner the termination fee and, in order to obtain such\npayment, Republic Services makes a claim against US Ecology that results in a judgment against US Ecology,\nUS Ecology will be required to pay to Republic Services the reasonable costs and expenses of Republic\nServices incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, with interest at the prime rate.\nFurthermore, if the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by US Ecology or Republic Services because\neither the effective time has not occurred on or before August 8, 2023, or a law or injunction has been\nenacted by any governmental entity which enjoins the merger, and at the time of such termination the only\nconditions to the closing which have not been satisfied are the condition relating to required regulatory\napprovals (including under the HSR Act), the condition relating to whether a law or injunction has been\nenacted by any governmental entity which enjoins the merger and/or the condition relating to the imposition\nof a Burdensome Condition, then Republic Services will be required to reimburse US Ecology for 50% of its\nreasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger up to $5,000,000\n(i.e., Republic Services\u2019 reimbursement shall not exceed $2,500,000).\n81 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSpecific Performance\nUS Ecology and Republic Services have agreed that (i) irreparable damage would occur if any provision of\nthe Merger Agreement were not performed, (ii) that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent\nbreaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the\nterms and provisions of the Merger Agreement in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any\nDelaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and (iii)\nthat no party will oppose the granting of an injunction or specific performance as provided in the Merger\nAgreement.\nAmendment\u037e Waivers\nAt any time prior to the effective time, the Merger Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and\nall respects by written agreement signed by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement. However, following\nthe receipt of the approval of US Ecology\u2019s stockholders of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement\nmay not be amended in a way which would require US Ecology to submit the amendment to its stockholders\nfor an additional approval.\nAt any time prior to the effective time, the parties to the Merger Agreement may extend the time for\nperformance of the other parties\u2019 obligations under the Merger Agreement, waive any inaccuracies in the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other parties in the Merger Agreement, or waive compliance with any\nof the covenants, agreements, or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement. Any such extension or\nwaiver must be in writing, and the failure of any party to assert any of its rights under the Merger Agreement\nor otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver by any party of a breach of any provision\nof the Merger Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior to subsequent breach of\nthe same or any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\nExpenses\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, each of the parties has agreed to bear its own\nexpenses in connection with the Merger Agreement. However, Republic Services must pay all filing fees in\nconnection with any required regulatory approvals (including under the HSR Act) with respect to the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nGoverning Law\u037e Jurisdiction\nThe Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law.\nThe parties have agreed to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any\nstate appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter arising out of the\nMerger Agreement. The parties have also agreed to waive all rights to a jury trial arising out of the Merger\nAgreement.\n82 \n",

        "Section Text": "\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS\nIf the Merger Agreement is adopted by US Ecology stockholders, stockholders who do not vote in favor of\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for\nappraisal of their shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as \u201cSection 262\u201d)\nwill be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is\nqualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. The\nfollowing summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation\nthat stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of US\nEcology common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\nperson having a beneficial interest in shares of US Ecology common stock held of record in the name of\nanother person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to\nfollow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold\nyour shares of US Ecology common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise\nappraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of US Ecology common stock who do not vote in favor of the proposal\nto adopt the Merger Agreement with respect to such shares, who duly demand appraisal in respect of such\nshares, who continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time, and who\notherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to the appraisal by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery of the fair value of their shares of US Ecology common stock, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid\nupon the amount determined to be the fair value of the shares from the effective date of the merger, as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings,\nthe surviving company may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case\ninterest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii)\ninterest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,\nthe corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to\nappraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This Proxy\nStatement constitutes US Ecology\u2019s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in\nconnection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement.\nIn connection with the merger, any holder of US Ecology common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully. Failure to\nstrictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal\nrights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the\nmerger consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest. Moreover, because of the\ncomplexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of US Ecology common\nstock, if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, US Ecology urges such stockholder to seek the\nadvice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of US Ecology common stock\nmust do ALL of the following:\nThe stockholder must NOT vote such shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nBecause a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will,\nunless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and\nwho wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, abstain or not vote its shares\u037e\nThe stockholder must deliver to US Ecology a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n88 \u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of US Ecology common stock from the date of\nmaking the demand through the effective time. A stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the\nstockholder transfers the shares before the effective time\u037e and\nA stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (or any person\nwho is the beneficial owner of shares entitled to appraisal held either in a voting trust or by a nominee\non behalf of such person and for which such record holder has complied with such requirements), or\nthe surviving company, must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a\ndetermination of the fair value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal within 120 days after the\neffective time. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of US Ecology\nstockholders to take all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of US\nEcology common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of US Ecology common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to US\nEcology, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the\nappraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder must not submit a blank proxy that is not revoked\nor vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A holder of shares of US Ecology common\nstock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for\nappraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time. A proxy that is\nsubmitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal with\nrespect to such shares and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a\nstockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing\ninstructions to vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain from voting on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or not vote its shares. Neither voting against the proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the\ntaking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of US Ecology\nstockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of US Ecology common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares\nregistered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of US Ecology common stock\nshould be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform US Ecology of the\nidentity of the holder and that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in\nconnection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares\nare owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand\nmust be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for\n2 or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the\nagent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the\nagent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH\nTHEIR BROKERS, BANKS AND NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE\nPROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR\nAPPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF\nRECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE,\nMUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY\nMANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\n89 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to US Ecology, Inc.,\n101 S. Capitol Blvd., Suite 1000, Boise, Idaho 83702, Attention: Secretary, and must be delivered before the\nvote on the Merger Agreement is taken at the Special Meeting and should be executed by, or on behalf of,\nthe record holder of the shares of US Ecology common stock.\nAny holder of US Ecology common stock who has no commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration\noffered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to US Ecology a written withdrawal of the demand\nfor appraisal within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. However, any such attempt to withdraw the\ndemand made more than 60 days after the effective time will require written approval of the surviving\ncompany. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval\nof the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that such requirement will not affect the right of any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered pursuant to the merger\n(without interest) within 60 calendar days after the effective time of the merger.\nNotice by the Surviving Company\nIf the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time, the surviving company will notify each\nholder of US Ecology common stock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of\nthe proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date\nthereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving company or any holder of US\nEcology common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section\n262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a\ncopy served on the surviving company in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving\ncompany is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition, and holders should not\nassume that the surviving company will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair\nvalue of shares of US Ecology common stock. Accordingly, any holders of US Ecology common stock who\ndesire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in\nrespect of shares of US Ecology common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.\nThe failure of a holder of US Ecology common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in\nSection 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time, any holder of US Ecology common stock who has complied with the\nrequirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nsurviving company a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and with respect to which US Ecology has received demands for\nappraisal and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving company must provide this\nstatement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a\nstatement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever\nis later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person\nmay, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving company the\nforegoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a\nstockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of US Ecology common stock (or any such\nbeneficial owner) and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving company, the surviving company will then\nbe obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as\nrequired by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to\ndetermine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to\n90 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nappraisal thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment\nfor their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of\nthe pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. In addition, the Court of\nChancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to\nappraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the US Ecology common stock eligible for appraisal or (ii)\nthe value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal\nexceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of US Ecology common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will appraise the fair value of the shares of US Ecology common stock, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid\nupon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will\nbe compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and\nthe date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the\nsurviving company may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case\ninterest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii)\ninterest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc. (\u201cWeinberger\u201d) the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that\n\u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The\nDelaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider\nmarket value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts\nthat could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has recently indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant\nfactors the Court of Chancery may consider in determining fair value and that absent deficiencies in the sale\nprocess the transaction price should be given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d Section 262 provides that fair value is\nto be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In\nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the\nspeculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are\nknown or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the\nconsideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and\nthat an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262. Although US Ecology believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as\nto the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders\nshould recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as,\nthe merger consideration. Neither US Ecology nor Republic Services anticipates offering more than the merger\nconsideration to any stockholder of US Ecology exercising appraisal rights, and each of US Ecology and\nRepublic Services reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262,\nthe fair value of a share of US Ecology common stock is less than the merger consideration. If a petition for\nappraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings\n(which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems\n91 \n",

The summary of the Proposed Transaction set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the\nterms of the Agreement.\nWe have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, to the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than the holders of any\nDissenting Shares or any Cancelled Shares (collectively, the \u201cExcluded Stockholders\u201d)) of the Merger\nConsideration to be offered to such stockholders in the Proposed Transaction. We have not been requested\nto opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company\u2019s underlying business\ndecision to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the\nProposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner\naddress, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or\nemployees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger\nConsideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the Proposed Transaction.

Our opinion does\nnot address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to any other transaction or\nbusiness strategy in which the Company might engage.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) a draft of the Agreement, dated as of February 8,\n2022, and the specific terms of the Proposed Transaction\u037e (2) publicly available information concerning the\nCompany that we believe to be relevant to our analysis, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March\n31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021\u037e (3) financial and operating information with respect to the\nbusiness, operations and prospects of the Company furnished to us by the Company, including financial\nprojections of the Company prepared by management of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d)\u037e (4) a\ntrading history of the Company\u2019s common stock from January 1, 2021 to January 25, 2022 and a comparison\nof that trading history with those of other companies that we deemed relevant\u037e (5) a\nB-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS\ncomparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of the Company and certain\nmultiples of financial metrics based on the financial metrics of the Company with those of other companies\nthat we deemed relevant\u037e (6)published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future\nfinancial performance and price targets of the Company\u037e and (7) a comparison of the financial terms of the\nProposed Transaction with the financial terms of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant. In\naddition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business,\noperations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects and have undertaken such other studies,\nanalyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial\nand other information used by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not\nassumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information) and have further\nrelied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or\ncircumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading.
