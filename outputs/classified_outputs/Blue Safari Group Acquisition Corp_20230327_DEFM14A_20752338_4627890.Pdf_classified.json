Following dissolution,\nBSGA will no longer exist as a company. In any liquidation, the funds held in the Trust Account, plus\nany interest earned thereon (net of taxes payable), together with any remaining out-of-trust net assets,\nwill be distributed pro-rata to holders of ordinary shares who acquired such shares in the IPO or in the\naftermarket. The estimated consideration that each ordinary share would be paid at liquidation would be\napproximately US$10.87 per share for shareholders based on amounts on deposit in the Trust Account\nas of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The closing price of BSGA Ordinary Shares on\nNasdaq as of March 24, 2023 was US$10.73. The Initial Shareholders waived the right to any liquidation\ndistribution with respect to any ordinary shares held by them.\nIf I am a holder of BSGA Units, can I exercise Redemption Rights with respect to my BSGA Units?\nNo. Holders of outstanding BSGA Units must elect to separate the units into the underlying public\nshares and public rights prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares. If you\nhold your units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must notify your broker or bank that you\nelect to separate the BSGA Units into the underlying public shares and public rights of BSGA, or if you\nhold units registered in your own name, you must contact Continental, BSGA\u2019s transfer agent, directly\nand instruct them to do so. The Redemption Rights include the requirement that a holder must identify\nitself in writing as a beneficial holder and provide its legal name, phone number and address to the\ntransfer agent in order to validly redeem its shares. If you fail to cause your units to be separated and\ndelivered to Continental, prior to 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on April 7, 2023, you will not be able to exercise\nyour redemption rights with respect to your Public Shares.\nIf I am a holder of BSGA Rights, can I exercise Redemption Rights with respect to my rights?\nNo. Holders of BSGA Rights have no Redemption Rights.\nWhat are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising my Redemption Rights?\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares in redemption of such shares will\nbe a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

For more details, see the section entitled \u201cThe Business Combination Proposal\u202f-\u202fBSGA Board\u2019s\nReview of Valuation.\u201d The following sets forth the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and a\ndiscussion of this information:\nBitdeer\u2019s revenue is estimated to be US$330.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to\nUS$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily contributed by a decrease\nin revenue generated from its proprietary mining business, driven by (i) the price drop of Bitcoin, the most\nsignificant type of cryptocurrency involved in Bitdeer\u2019s business and (ii) a decrease in the comparative\nnumber of Bitcoin mined from proprietary mining, resulting from a decrease in the amount of hash rate\nallocated to Bitdeer\u2019s proprietary mining business as a percentage of the total network hash rate.\nBitdeer\u2019s loss is estimated to be US$62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to\nprofit of US$82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such change was primarily due to a decrease\nof revenue and an increase in electricity cost associated with increased power supply needs and electricity\nprices.\nBitdeer\u2019s adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be US$91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\ncompared to US$281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily as a result of\nloss for the year. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure used by Bitdeer\u2019s management as a supplemental\nmeasure to review and assess Bitdeer\u2019s operating performance. Bitdeer defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based payment\nexpenses under IFRS 2. See \u201c- Adjusted EBITDA and Reconciliation\u201d below.\nBitdeer\u2019s net asset value is estimated to be US$316.3 million as of December 31, 2022 , compared to\nUS$288.1 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer reflects trends consistent with Bitdeer\u2019s\nperformance for the first six months ended June 30, 2022 disclosed in the section entitled \u201cBitdeer\u2019s\nManagement\u2019s Disclosure and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nAlthough Bitdeer does not expect its actual results to vary materially from the unaudited preliminary\nnumbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus, these preliminary numbers are subject to potential\nadjustments that may be identified during Bitdeer\u2019s year-end audit. Neither Bitdeer nor BTG will refer back to\nthe above unaudited preliminary numbers in BTG\u2019s future periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act.\nNeither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum LLP or any other independent accountant has audited, reviewed,\nexamined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to afore-mentioned financial numbers\nand accordingly, neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum LLP or any other independent accountant expresses\nany opinion or any other form of assurance on such information and assume no responsibility for, and\ndisclaim any association with, the unaudited preliminary numbers.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Reconciliation\nIn evaluating its business, Bitdeer considers and uses a non-IFRS measure, adjusted EBITDA, as a\nsupplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based\npayments expenses under IFRS 2. Such measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures\nused by other companies. As a result, such measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a\nsubstitute analysis for, Bitdeer\u2019s profit/(loss) for the periods, as determined in accordance with IFRS. For\nadditional details, including a reconciliation of profit/(loss), the most comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted\n23 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEBITDA, see the section entitled \u201cBitdeer\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\u202f-\u202fNon-IFRS Financial Measure\u201d of this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe table below represents a reconciliation of estimated profit/(loss) for the year ended December 31,\n2022 to estimated adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(in US$ millions)\nYear Ended \nDecember 31,\n2022 \n(unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nProfit/(loss) for the year\n(62.4\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization\n66.4\nInterest expense/(income), net\n1.0\nIncome tax expenses/(benefit)\n(4.4\nShare-based payment expenses\n90.6\nAdjusted EBITDA\n91.2\nThe Business Combination Proposal\nThe Merger Agreement contemplates three mergers in connection with the Business Combination,\nconsisting of the First SPAC Merger, the Second SPAC Merger and the Acquisition Merger. At the effective\ntime of the First SPAC Merger, BSGA Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into BSGA, and the separate\ncorporate existence of BSGA Merger Sub 1 will cease and BSGA will continue as the surviving company\nunder the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Immediately following the First SPAC Merger and at the effective\ntime of the Second SPAC Merger, BSGA will be merged with and into BSGA Merger Sub 2 and BSGA Merger\nSub 2 will continue as the surviving company in the Second SPAC Merger under the laws of the British\nVirgin Islands as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG. Following the Second SPAC Merger, at the effective\ntime of the Acquisition Merger, Bitdeer Merger Sub will be merged with and into Bitdeer. Following the\nAcquisition Merger, the separate corporate existence of Bitdeer Merger Sub will cease and Bitdeer will\ncontinue as the surviving company in the Acquisition Merger under the laws of the Cayman Islands and\nbecome a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.\nReasons for the Structure of the Business Combination\nAs contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be consummated via a\nmultiple-merger structure (also known as \u201cdouble dummy\u201d), consisting of the Initial Mergers and the\nAcquisition Merger. Under such structure, each of BSGA and Bitdeer will merge with a subsidiary of BTG, a\nnewly formed company, through the Initial Mergers and the Acquisition Merger, respectively. Upon the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, BTG will be the public company listed on Nasdaq. The multiple-\nmerger structure was chosen by the parties to the Merger Agreement for business, legal and accounting\nreasons. In particular, given BTG\u2019s eligibility as a foreign private issuer, its reporting obligations under U.S.\nsecurities laws will be less burdensome compared to domestic registrants and BTG will be able to prepare\nand file its financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards. Such\nbenefit will not be available immediately upon Closing if the Business Combination were to be conducted\nthrough a reverse triangular merger in which Bitdeer would be acquired directly by BSGA, which would\ncontinue to report as a domestic registrant upon Closing until further assessment of factors such as its\nshareholder base and location of assets at a future date pursuant to U.S. securities laws. Operationally,\nfollowing the Business Combination conducted via the proposed structure, BTG will be a holding company\nthat will operate Bitdeer\u2019s current business through its subsidiaries, which is consistent with the\nexpectations of Bitdeer and BSGA\u2019s management in relation to post-Business Combination corporate and\noperational structure.\nIn addition, the Initial Mergers are structured as two separate mergers primarily for U.S. tax reasons. The\nexchange of BSGA Securities (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d) for BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business Combination is intended to qualify as a tax-free\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations -\nConsequences\n24 \n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the Business Combination - Qualification of the Initial Mergers as a Reorganization.\u201d The Initial Mergers\nthat effect the exchange of BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares are structured as a two-step\nmerger in the form of the First SPAC Merger and the Second SPAC Merger to reduce the risk that holders will\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax on the exchange of their BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares.\nConditions to Closing\nThe Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions by the parties\nthereto, including, among others, (i) approval of the mergers and the transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement by the shareholders of BSGA and Bitdeer\u037e (ii) effectiveness of the Registration Statement\u037e\n(iii) expiration or termination of the waiting period under antitrust laws\u037e (iv) receipt of approval for listing on\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\u037e and (v) BSGA having at least US$5,000,001 of\nnet tangible assets remaining immediately after the Closing.\nIn addition, the obligations of each of BSGA and Bitdeer to consummate the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement are subject to customary conditions, including, among other aspects, (i) the\naccuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to customary bring-down\nstandards)\u037e and (ii) the covenants of the other party having been performed in all material respects.\nRelated Agreements\nVoting and Support Agreement\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, BTG,\nBSGA and Bitdeer also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement with certain Bitdeer shareholder (the\n\u201cSupporting Shareholder\u201d) with respect to the shares of Bitdeer currently owned by the Supporting\nShareholder. The Voting and Support Agreement provides that the Supporting Shareholder will appear at\nshareholders meetings of Bitdeer and vote, consent or approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether at a shareholder meeting of Bitdeer or by written consent.\nIt further provides that the Supporting Shareholder will vote against (or act by written consent against) any\nalternative proposals or actions that would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nLock-up Agreement\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the closing of the Merger Agreement, certain\nholders of at least 95% of the outstanding shares of the Company immediately prior to the closing\n(collectively, the \u201cLock-up Shareholders\u201d) will enter into certain lock-up agreements (the \u201cLock-up\nAgreements\u201d) with BTG, pursuant to which each Lock-up Shareholder agrees to, among other things, lock up\nall equity interests of BTG held by such Lock-up Shareholder immediately after the effective time of the\nAcquisition Merger for a period of 180 days from such effective time, subject to certain exceptions.\nMerger Consideration\nIn accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon the effective\ntime of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Share will be cancelled and\nexchanged for the right to receive one BTG Class A Ordinary Share, and (ii) each BSGA Right will be\ncancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a BTG Class A Ordinary Share in the\nsame manner as BSGA Ordinary Share as set forth in subclause (i), with fractional shares to be either\nrounded up to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions\nof British Virgin Islands law.\nAt the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each BSGA Ordinary Share issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC Merger (other than the BSGA Dissenting Shares) will\nbe cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive one BTG Class A Ordinary Share, except\nthat the BSGA Ordinary Shares that are owned by BSGA as treasury shares or owned by any direct or\nindirect subsidiary of BSGA will be canceled and cease to exist without any consideration\u037e (ii) each BSGA\n25 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDissenting Share owned by BSGA shareholders who have validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or\nlost their rights to dissent from the First SPAC Merger pursuant to BVI Companies Act will represent only\nthe right to receive the payment resulting from the procedure set forth in the BVI Companies Act with\nrespect to the BSGA Dissenting Shares owned by such BSGA Shareholders, and (iii) the one share of BTG\nthat was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC Merger will be redeemed for an\namount of US$0.0000001 and cancelled.\nAt the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, (i) each Bitdeer Ordinary Share and each Bitdeer\nPreference Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger\n(other than any Key Executive Shares and Bitdeer Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and cease to exist in\nexchange for the right to receive such number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that is equal to the Exchange\nRatio\u037e (ii) each Key Executive Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the\nAcquisition Merger will be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive such number of\nBTG Class V Ordinary Shares that is equal to the Exchange Ratio\u037e (iii) each Bitdeer RSU outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, whether vested or unvested, will be\nassumed by BTG and converted into an award of restricted share units, representing the right to receive, on\nthe same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting, settlement and expiration provisions) as applied\nto such Bitdeer RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares, except that the number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares subject to such restricted share units will\nequal the product of the number of Bitdeer Ordinary Shares that were subject to such Bitdeer RSU multiplied\nby the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share\u037e (iv) the Bitdeer Convertible Note\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition Merger will be assumed by BTG and\nrepresent the rights to receive, on the same terms and conditions as applied to such Bitdeer Convertible\nNote, BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, except that the number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares to be received\nupon conversion of the Bitdeer Convertible Note will equal the product of the number of Bitdeer Ordinary\nShares issuable upon conversion of the Bitdeer Convertible Note multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share\u037e and (v) each Bitdeer Dissenting Share owned by Bitdeer shareholders who\nhave validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to dissent from the Acquisition\nMerger pursuant to the Cayman Companies Act will represent only the right to receive the payment resulting\nfrom the procedure set forth in the Cayman Companies Act with respect to the Bitdeer Dissenting Shares\nowned by such Bitdeer shareholders.\nReasons for BSGA Board\u2019s Approval of the Business Combination\nBSGA was formed to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,\nreorganization, or similar business combination with one or more business entities. The BSGA Board sought\nto do so by using the networks and industry experience of both the Sponsor, the BSGA Board, and the BSGA\nmanagement to identify and acquire one or more businesses.\nIn evaluating the transaction with Bitdeer, the BSGA Board consulted with its legal counsel and\naccounting and other advisors and considered a range of factors. In particular, the BSGA Board considered,\namong others, the following factors, although not weighted or in any order of significance:\nBitdeer satisfies a number of acquisition criteria that BSGA had established to evaluate prospective\nbusiness combination targets. The BSGA Board determined that Bitdeer satisfies a number of criteria\nand guidelines set forth during its initial public offering, including (i) unique competitive advantage in\nthe markets and/or underexploited growth opportunities that BSGA is uniquely positioned to identify\u037e\n(ii) strong management team that can create significant value\u037e and (iii) potential to generate strong\nfree cash flow.\nFavorable prospects for future growth. Information from BSGA and Bitdeer\u2019s management regarding\n(i) Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, services, management,\ncompetitive position, and strategic business goals and objectives\u037e (ii) general economic, industry,\nregulatory, and financial market conditions\u037e and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within\nBitdeer\u2019s industry.\nWorld\u2019s largest scale of proprietary hash rate. Bitdeer was the world\u2019s largest holder of proprietary\nhash rate for Bitcoin as of June 30, 2021, according to Frost & Sullivan. Its proprietary hash rate\nprovides it with a clear edge in all of its business lines and anchors its unique business model.\n26 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnique business model powers organic hash rate expansion. Bitdeer established a business model\nthat allows it to constantly reinforce its market-leading position and outpace our competitors in terms\nof scaling up our proprietary hash rate.\nAmple power supply and low electricity cost secured by global mining datacenters. Bitdeer\nstrategically opened five mining datacenters in the United States and Norway, where low electricity\ncost and crypto-friendly policies support stable operations. With experience in site selection, facility\ndesign, construction and maintenance in over 30 locations around the globe, Bitdeer\u2019s dedicated\nglobal team for mining datacenter construction understands the critical needs of mining as well as the\ncomplex and constantly evolving global landscape of electricity supply. They also have extensive\nconnections with local electricity experts and power enterprises around the world.\nVisionary management team with a proven track record of innovation and execution. Bitdeer is led\nby a management team with extensive experience in the cryptocurrency industry, encompassing\nresearch and development, mining and sales of mining machines, and many of them are pioneers in\nmining datacenters construction and operation.\nBest Available Opportunity. The BSGA Board determined, after a thorough review of other business\ncombination opportunities reasonably available to BSGA, that the proposed Business Combination\nrepresents the best potential business combination for BSGA based upon the process utilized to\nevaluate and assess other potential acquisition targets, and the BSGA Board\u2019s belief that such\nprocesses had not presented a better alternative.\nContinued Significant Ownership by Bitdeer. The BSGA Board considered that Bitdeer\u2019s existing\nequity holders would be receiving a significant amount of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in the\nproposed Business Combination and that Bitdeer\u2019s principal shareholders and key executives are\n\u201crolling over\u201d their existing equity interests of Bitdeer into equity interests in BTG. The current\nBitdeer Shareholders are expected to own approximately 93.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares, constituting approximately 11.0% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares\nvoting together as a single class, assuming (i) none of BSGA\u2019s public shareholders exercise their\nredemption rights in connection with the Business Combination and (ii) no Bitdeer\u2019s shareholder\nexercises its dissenters\u2019 rights. If the actual facts are different from these assumptions, the percentage\nownership retained by Bitdeer\u2019s existing shareholders in BTG will be different.\nUse of Retained Proceeds. As represented by Bitdeer\u2019s management, the proceeds to be delivered to\nBTG in connection with the Business Combination (including funds that remain in BSGA\u2019s trust\naccount after taking into effect redemptions), are expected to remain on the balance sheet of BTG\nafter Closing in order to fund Bitdeer\u2019s existing operations and support new and existing growth\ninitiatives. The BSGA Board considered this factor a sign of commitment by Bitdeer\u2019s management to\nBitdeer\u2019s business following the Business Combination and their confidence in the benefits to be\nrealized as a result of the Business Combination.\nLikelihood of Closing the Business Combination. The BSGA Board believes that an acquisition by\nBSGA has a reasonable likelihood of closing without potential issues under applicable antitrust and\ncompetition laws and without potential issues from any regulatory authorities.\nFor a more complete description of BSGA Board\u2019s reasons for approving the Business Combination,\nincluding other factors and risks considered by the BSGA Board, see the section entitled \u201cThe Business\nCombination Proposal\u202f-\u202fReasons for BSGA Board\u2019s Approval of the Business Combination.\u201d\nOpinion of BSGA\u2019s Valuation Advisor\nBSGA retained Royson to provide to the BSGA Board with an opinion regarding the valuation of\nBitdeer. BSGA also retained an international accounting firm, (the \u201cAudit Firm\u201d), to further review Royson\u2019s\nwork product regarding the reasonableness of the methodologies as well as the results thereof. Royson\nprovided BSGA with their opinion dated November 17, 2021 (the \u201cOriginal Valuation Report\u201d), an updated\nopinion dated December 14, 2021 (the \u201cUpdated Valuation Report\u201d) and a further updated opinion dated\nMarch 7, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Valuation Report\u201d), which were reviewed by the Audit Firm. Royson\u2019s updated\nopinion as set forth in the 2023 Valuation Report, based upon its investigation, analysis and assumptions\ndescribed therein\n27 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand the appraisal method employed, is that the fair market value of the 100% non-controlling equity interest\nin Bitdeer as of February 17, 2023, being the Final Appraisal Date, is reasonably stated to be one billion, two\nhundred and fifty six million (US$1,256,000,000). See the section entitled \u201cThe Business Combination\nProposal\u202f-\u202fValuation Reports of BSGA\u2019s Valuation Advisor\u202f-\u202f2023 Valuation Report of BSGA\u2019s Valuation\nAdvisor\u201d and the valuation reports of Royson attached hereto as Annex D for more details.\nFairness Opinion of BSGA\u2019s Financial Advisor\nIJW delivered a written opinion, dated March 7, 2023, addressed to the BSGA Board to the effect that,\nas of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, conditions and limitations set\nforth in the opinion, the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business Combination pursuant to the term\nof the transaction, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of BSGA. See the section\nentitled \u201cThe Business Combination Proposal\u202f-\u202fFairness Opinion of BSGA\u2019s Financial Advisor,\u201d and the\nfairness opinion of IJW attached hereto as Annex E for more details.\nThe full text of IJW\u2019s written opinion, dated March 7, 2023, which sets forth the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the\nopinion (which are also summarized herein), is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus and\nis incorporated herein by reference. IJW\u2019s opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the BSGA Board\n(solely in its capacity as such and not in any other capacity) in its evaluation of the Business Combination\n(and, in its engagement letter, IJW provided its consent to the inclusion of the text of its opinion as part of\nthis proxy statement/prospectus). IJW\u2019s opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business Combination and does not address BSGA\u2019s\nunderlying business decision to effect the Business Combination or the relative merits of the Business\nCombination as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to\nBSGA. IJW\u2019s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder of BSGA should\nvote or act with respect to the Business Combination or any other matter.\nOwnership and Transaction Structure\nThe following diagrams illustrate in simplified terms the current structure of each of BSGA and Bitdeer,\nthe steps of the proposed Business Combination, and the expected structure after the Business\nCombination.\n28 \n* \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTreated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n29 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain Information Relating to BTG and BSGA\nBTG Listing\nBTG plans to apply for listing, to be effective at the time of the Closing of the Business Combination, of\nthe BTG Class A Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq and will obtain clearance by DTC as promptly as practicable\nfollowing the issuance thereof, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.\nDelisting and Deregistration of BSGA\nIf the Business Combination is completed, BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, BSGA Units and BSGA\nRights shall be delisted from Nasdaq and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.\nEmerging Growth Company\nUpon consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as\ndefined in the JOBS Act. BTG will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of (i) the\nlast day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, (b)\nin which BTG has total annual gross revenue of at least US$1.07 billion or (c) in which BTG is deemed to be a\nlarge accelerated filer, which means the market value of BTG Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds US$700\nmillion as of the last business day of BTG\u2019s prior second fiscal quarter, BTG has been subject to Exchange\nAct reporting requirements for at least 12 calendar months\u037e and filed at least one annual report, and (ii) the\ndate on which BTG issued more than US$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year\nperiod. BTG intends to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable\nto most other public companies, whether or not they are classified as \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d\nincluding, but not limited to, an exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nrequiring that BTG\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the\neffectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and reduced disclosure obligations regarding\nexecutive compensation.\nForeign Private Issuer\nAs a \u201cforeign private issuer,\u201d BTG will be subject to different U.S. securities laws than domestic U.S.\nissuers. The rules governing the information that BTG must disclose differ from those governing U.S.\ncompanies pursuant to the Exchange Act. BTG will be exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act\nprescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements to shareholders. Those proxy statements are not\nexpected to conform to Schedule 14A of the proxy rules promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nIn addition, as a \u201cforeign private issuer,\u201d BTG\u2019s officers and directors and holders of more than 10% of\nthe issued and outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, will be exempt from the rules under the Exchange\nAct requiring insiders to report purchases and sales of ordinary shares as well as from Section 16 short\nswing profit reporting and liability. See \u201cRisk Factors\u202f-\u202fRisks Related to BTG\u202f-\u202fBTG is a foreign private issuer\nwithin the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such, it is exempt from certain provisions\napplicable to domestic public companies in the United States.\u201d\nControlled Company\nUpon the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control a majority of the voting power\nof BTG\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, BTG will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning\nof applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting\npower for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled\ncompany.\u201d For so long as BTG remains a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d it may elect not to comply with certain\ncorporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\nthat a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors\u037e\nfor an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation\ncommittees\u037e\n30 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat it has a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of\nindependent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities\u037e\nand\nthat it has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a\nwritten charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibility.\nBTG intends to use these exemptions upon the closing of the Business Combination and it may\ncontinue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future. As a result, you may not have the same\nprotections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate\ngovernance requirements.\nAnticipated Accounting Treatment\nThe Business Combination will be accounted for as a \u201creverse recapitalization\u201d in accordance with\nIFRS. Under this method of accounting, BSGA will be treated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company for financial\nreporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business\nCombination, the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders are expected to have a majority of the voting power of BTG, Bitdeer\nwill comprise all of the ongoing operations of combined company, Bitdeer will comprise a majority of the\ngoverning body of combined company, and Bitdeer\u2019s senior management will comprise all of the senior\nmanagement of combined company. Since BSGA does not meet the definition of a business under IFRS, the\ntransaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, and it is accounted for as an equity-\nsettled, share-based payment transaction in accordance with IFRS 2, \u201cShare-based Payments\u201d. Accordingly,\nfor accounting purposes, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of Bitdeer issuing\nshares for the net assets of BSGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BSGA will be stated\nat historical costs. Any difference in the fair value of the consideration deemed to have been issued by\nBitdeer and the fair value of BSGA\u2019s identifiable net assets represents a listing service received by Bitdeer\nand is recorded through profit and loss. No goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. Operations\nprior to the Business Combination will be those of Bitdeer.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not subject as\na closing condition to any additional federal, state or foreign regulatory requirement or approval, except for\n(i) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-\nScott-Rodio Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated\nthereunder, and (ii) filings with the registrar of the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands necessary to\neffectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the respective plans of merger.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the proposals to be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of\nBSGA, a shareholder should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus and especially consider the\nfactors discussed in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, and the business\nand financial condition of BTG subsequent to the Closing are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,\nincluding those highlighted in the section title \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d The occurrence of one or more of the events\nor circumstances described below, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may\nadversely affect BSGA\u2019s ability to effect the Business Combination, and may have an adverse effect on the\nbusiness, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of BSGA prior to the Business\nCombination and that of BTG subsequent to the Business Combination. These risks include, among other\nthings, the following:\nThe cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is characterized by constant changes. If\nBitdeer fails to continuously innovate and to provide solutions or services that meet the expectations\nof its customers, it may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers.\nBitdeer\u2019s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted\nby sharp Bitcoin price fluctuation.\n31 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe supply of Bitcoins available for mining is limited and Bitdeer may not be able to quickly adapt to\nnew businesses when all the Bitcoins have been mined.\nAlthough Bitdeer has an organic way of growing its mining fleets, its business is nevertheless capital\nintensive. Bitdeer may need additional capital but may not be able to obtain it in a timely manner and\non favorable terms or at all.\nBitdeer has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities and incurred net losses in the\npast. It can provide no assurance of its future operating results.\nBitdeer may not be able to maintain its competitive position as cryptocurrency networks experience\nincreases in total network hash rate.\nBitdeer has experienced and may experience in the future hash rate loss during its operations due to\nfactors beyond its control.\nBitdeer is subject to risks associated with its need for significant electric power and the limited\navailability of power resources, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. In the event\nof any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting, BTG may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result,\nholders of BTG Ordinary Shares could lose confidence in BTG\u2019s financial and other public reporting,\nwhich is likely to negatively affect BTG\u2019s business and the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares.\nA market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may not develop, which would adversely affect the\nliquidity and price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nThe market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be volatile.\nBTG will issue BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, and BTG Class V Ordinary Shares convertible into BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares, as consideration for the Business Combination, and BTG may issue\nadditional BTG Class A Ordinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities without\napproval of the holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, which would dilute existing ownership\ninterests and may depress the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nBSGA will be forced to liquidate the Trust Account if it cannot consummate a business combination\nby the Combination Deadline. In the event of a liquidation, BSGA\u2019s public shareholders will receive\nUS$10.87 per share and the BSGA Rights will expire worthless.\nThe Initial Shareholders who own ordinary shares and private placement units will not participate in\nliquidation distributions and, therefore, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether\nthe Business Combination is appropriate.\nBSGA Shareholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of BTG\nOrdinary Shares as consideration in the Business Combination and from other dilution sources.\nHaving a minority share position may reduce the influence that the non-redeeming BSGA\nshareholders have on the management of BTG upon Closing.\nIf third parties bring claims against BSGA, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-\nshare liquidation price received by BSGA Shareholders may be less than US$10.87.\nBSGA\u2019s directors and officers may have certain conflicts in determining to recommend the acquisition\nof Bitdeer, since certain of their interests, and certain interests of their affiliates and associates, are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder.\nBecoming a public company through a business combination rather than an underwritten offering\npresents risks to unaffiliated investors of BTG. Subsequent to the completion of the Business\nCombination, BTG may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and\nimpairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition,\nresults of operations and the price of BTG securities, which could cause BTG shareholders to lose\nsome or all of their investment.\n32 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf BSGA were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act,\nBSGA would be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and its activities would be\nseverely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless BSGA is able to modify its activities so\nthat it would not be deemed an investment company, BSGA would expect to abandon the efforts to\ncomplete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate itself.\nBTG will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on Nasdaq. However, BTG\nmay be unable to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.\nAny distributions received by BSGA Shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was\nproved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, BSGA was unable to\npay its debts as they fell due in the ordinary course of business.\nIf BSGA\u2019s due diligence investigation of Bitdeer was inadequate, then shareholders of BSGA\nfollowing the Business Combination could lose some or all of their investment.\nIn the event that a significant number of Public Shares are redeemed, BSGA Ordinary Shares may\nbecome less liquid following the Business Combination.\nThe other risks and uncertainties discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus.\n33 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information\nincluded in this proxy statement/prospectus, before you decide whether to vote or instruct your vote to be\ncast to approve the proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Certain of the following risk\nfactors apply to the business and operations of Bitdeer and will also apply to the business and operations\nof BTG following the completion of the Business Combination. The occurrence of one or more of the events\nor circumstances described in these risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or\ncircumstances, may adversely affect the ability to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of the\nBusiness Combination, and may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results\nof operations, prospects and trading price of BTG\u2019s securities following the Business Combination. The\nrisks discussed below may not prove to be exhaustive and are based on certain assumptions made by BTG,\nBSGA and Bitdeer, which later may prove to be incorrect or incomplete. BTG, BSGA and Bitdeer may face\nadditional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to them, or that are currently deemed\nimmaterial, but which may also ultimately have an adverse effect on any such party. Certain of the\nfollowing risk factors are focused on Bitcoin which is the most significant type of cryptocurrency involved\nin Bitdeer\u2019s business operations. Such risk factors, however, are not limited to Bitcoin and may also apply\nto other types of cryptocurrencies.\nRisks Related to Bitdeer\nRisks Related to Bitdeer\u2019s Business, Operations, Industry and Financial Condition\nThe cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is characterized by constant changes. If Bitdeer fails to\ncontinuously innovate and to provide solutions or services that meet the expectations of its customers, Bitdeer may\nnot be able to attract new customers or retain existing customers, and hence its business and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected.\nThe cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is characterized by constant changes, including\nrapid technological evolution, continual shifts in customer demands, frequent introductions of new products\nand solutions and constant emergence of new industry standards and practices. Thus, Bitdeer\u2019s success will\ndepend, in part, on its ability to respond to these changes in a cost-effective and timely manner. Advances in\nBitcoin mining-related technology have led to increased demand for higher speed and power efficiency for\nsolving computational problems of increasing complexity. Bitdeer needs to invest significant resources in\nresearch and development in order to keep its services competitive in the market. Also, if Bitdeer is unable to\ngenerate enough revenue or raise sufficient capital to make adequate research and development investments\ngoing forward, Bitdeer\u2019s service improvement and relevant research and development initiatives may be\nrestricted or delayed, or Bitdeer may not be able to keep pace with the latest market trends and satisfy its\ncustomers\u2019 needs, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations.\nFurthermore, research and development activities are inherently uncertain, and Bitdeer might encounter\npractical difficulties in commercializing its research and development results, which could result in excessive\nresearch and development expenses or delays. Given the fast pace with which blockchain technologies have\nbeen and will continue to be developed, Bitdeer may not be able to timely upgrade its technologies in an\nefficient and cost-effective manner, or at all. In addition, new developments relating to computing power\n(e.g., quantum computer), computing energy consumption, blockchain and cryptocurrency could render\nBitdeer\u2019s services obsolete or unattractive. If Bitdeer is unable to keep up with the technological\ndevelopments and anticipate market trends, or if new technologies render its technologies or solutions\nobsolete, customers may no longer be attracted to its services. As a result, Bitdeer\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nBitdeer\u2019s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted by Bitcoin price\nfluctuation.\nBitdeer\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits (i.e., positive cash flow or profits) from Bitcoin mining is\ndirectly affected by the market price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price may impact the use of Bitdeer\u2019s mining\nmachines. When the market price of a Bitcoin drops below certain thresholds, the operation of existing\nmining machines may not be economically beneficial for Bitdeer. For a breakeven analysis, see the section\nentitled\n44 TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cBitdeer\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u202f-\u202fKey\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\u202f-\u202fPrice and volatility of Bitcoin.\u201d In addition, the depreciation\nand impairment potential of Bitdeer\u2019s mining machines may be affected by the volatility of the market prices\nof Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. See the section entitled \u201cBitdeer\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u202f-\u202fKey Factors Affecting Our Results of\nOperations\u202f-\u202fOur ability to procure mining machines at a lower cost.\u201d On the other hand, a drop in Bitcoin\nprice may also create an opportunity for Bitdeer to add cheaper mining machines to its mining fleets.\nThe appreciation potential of Bitcoin is high in general, which is due to several factors. Bitcoins are\ninherently scarce, given they are designed to have a finite supply of 21 million associated with a depreciating\nrewarding mechanism, termed \u201chalving,\u201d under which the reward for Bitcoin mining is reduced in half every\nfour years. See the section entitled \u201c- The \u201chalving\u201d of rewards available on the Bitcoin network, or the\nreduction of rewards on other networks, has had and in the future could have a negative impact on Bitdeer\u2019s\nability to generate revenue as its customers may not have an adequate incentive to continue transaction\nprocessing and customers may cease transaction processing operations altogether, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations\u201d for more details.\nThe growing recognition of Bitcoin also attracts large investment into the Bitcoin economy, as evidenced by\nan increasing installed network hash rate of Bitcoin globally, and increasing adoption of Bitcoin as an\ninvestment instrument and a payment method. Further, more countries are establishing clear and robust\nregulations to create a stable environment for Bitcoin mining and trading, which may facilitate the demand\nfor Bitcoins and Bitcoin price appreciation.\nDespite the general appreciation potential of Bitcoin, there are a number of other factors that contribute\nto changes in Bitcoin price and volatility, including, but not limited to, Bitcoin market sentiment,\nmacroeconomic factors, utility of Bitcoin, and idiosyncratic events such as exchange outages or social\nmedia, some of which are beyond Bitdeer\u2019s control. For example, decentralization, or the lack of control by a\ncentral authority, is a key reason that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have attracted many committed users.\nHowever, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is subject to growing discussion and suspicion. Some claim that\nmost of the actual services and businesses built within the Bitcoin ecosystem are in fact centralized since\nthey are run by specific people, in specific locations, with specific computer systems, and that they are\nsusceptible to specific regulations. Individuals, companies or groups, as well as Bitcoin exchanges that own\nvast amounts of Bitcoins, can affect the market price of Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin price has recently been\nadversely affected by the continued industry-wide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of\ncryptocurrency exchanges FTX Trading Ltd., et al. (\u201cFTX\u201d) (including its affiliated hedge fund Alameda\nResearch LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (\u201cThree Arrows\u201d), crypto miners Compute North\nLLC (\u201cCompute North\u201d) and Core Scientific Inc. (\u201cCore Scientific\u201d) and crypto lenders Celsius Network LLC,\net al. (\u201cCelsius Network\u201d), Voyager Digital Ltd., et al. (\u201cVoyager Digital\u201d) and BlockFi Inc., et al. (\u201cBlockFi\u201d).\nFurthermore, mining equipment production and mining pool locations are becoming centralized. Some argue\nthat the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is a fundamental flaw rather than a strength. The suspicion\nabout the decentralized nature of Bitcoin may cause the market to lose confidence in the prospect of the\nBitcoin industry, which would adversely affect Bitcoin price. This in turn could adversely affect the market\ndemand for Bitdeer\u2019s services and business.\nAny future significant reductions in the price of Bitcoin will likely have a material and adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that the Bitcoin price will\nremain high enough to sustain the demand for Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing and hosting services or that the\nBitcoin price will not decline significantly in the future. Furthermore, fluctuations in the Bitcoin price can\nhave an immediate impact on the trading price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares after the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination, even before its effect, if any, is reflected in Bitdeer\u2019s financial performance. If the\nBitcoin price drops, the expected economic return of Bitcoin mining activities will diminish, thereby resulting\nin a decrease in demand for Bitcoin-related services of Bitdeer, and in value appreciation from Bitdeer\u2019s\nproprietary mining activities. As a result, Bitdeer may need to reduce the price of its cloud hash rate and\nhosting services. For risks relating to the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuation on Bitdeer\u2019s growth trends, see\nthe section entitled \u201c- Bitdeer may be unable to execute its growth strategies or effectively maintain its rapid\ngrowth trends\u201d below.\n45 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe supply of Bitcoins available for mining is limited and Bitdeer may not be able to quickly adapt to new\nbusinesses when all the Bitcoins have been mined.\nBitcoins are inherently scarce, given they are designed to have a finite supply of 21 million associated\nwith \u201chalving\u201d mechanism. More than 19 million Bitcoins had already been mined as of June 30, 2022,\naccording to Frost & Sullivan. The number of blocks that can be solved in a year is designed to be fixed, and\nthe number of Bitcoins awarded for solving a block in the blockchain halves approximately every four years\nuntil the estimated complete depletion of Bitcoin available for mining by around 2140. When the Bitcoin\nnetwork was first launched, the reward for validating a new block was 50 Bitcoins. In November 2012, the\nreward for validating a new block was reduced to 25 Bitcoins. In July 2016, the reward for validating a new\nblock was reduced to 12.5 Bitcoins, and in May 2020, the reward was further reduced to 6.25 Bitcoins. The\nnext halving for Bitcoin is expected in 2024 at block 840,000, when the reward will reduce to 3.125 Bitcoins.\nWhile the remaining Bitcoins are not designed to be entirely depleted in the near future, a decrease in the\nreward for solving a block or an increase in the transaction fees may result in a decrease in incentives for\nminers to continue their mining activities and the loss of Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position among the\ncryptocurrencies, thereby reducing the demand for Bitcoin mining related services of Bitdeer. As of the date\nof this proxy statement/prospectus, the largest portion of Bitdeer\u2019s revenue was generated from its\nproprietary mining business and hash rate sales through Cloud Hash Rate, which are associated with\nBitcoin mining. Bitdeer may not be able to quickly adapt to new businesses or expand to other\ncryptocurrencies when all the Bitcoins have been discovered or Bitcoin is replaced by other\ncryptocurrencies as the mainstream cryptocurrency, which will result in a significant negative impact on\nBitdeer\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAlthough Bitdeer has an organic way of growing its mining fleets, its business is nevertheless capital intensive. It\nmay need additional capital but may not be able to obtain it in a timely manner and on favorable terms or at all.\nThe costs of constructing, developing, operating and maintaining cryptocurrency mining and hosting\nfacilities, and owning and operating a large fleet of the latest generation mining equipment are substantial.\nBitdeer\u2019s operations may require additional capital or financing from time to time in order to achieve further\ngrowth. Bitdeer may require additional cash resources due to the future growth and development of its\nbusiness. Bitdeer\u2019s future capital requirements may be substantial as Bitdeer seeks to expand its operations,\ndiversify its product offering, and pursue acquisitions and equity investments. If Bitdeer\u2019s cash resources\nare insufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, Bitdeer may seek to issue additional equity or debt securities\nor obtain new or expanded credit facilities or enter into additional factoring arrangements.\nBitdeer\u2019s ability to obtain external financing in the future may be subject to a variety of uncertainties,\nincluding its future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the liquidity of international\ncapital and lending markets. While Bitdeer faces less working capital constraints as it expands its hash rate\nsharing business, which generates quicker cash payback, the proprietary mining business is nevertheless\ncapital intensive. Bitdeer may need additional capital if Bitcoin price increases as it will likely push up prices\nfor supplies required for its proprietary mining business. However, in light of conditions impacting the\nindustry, it may be more difficult for Bitdeer to obtain equity or debt financing currently and/or in the future.\nSpecifically, the crypto assets industry has been negatively impacted by recent events such as the\nbankruptcies of Compute North, Core Scientific, Alameda Research LLC, BlockFi, Celsius Network, Voyager\nDigital, Three Arrows and FTX. In response to these events, the digital asset markets, including the market\nfor Bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset\nindustry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the\ndigital assets markets and in Bitcoin. Any indebtedness that Bitdeer may incur in the future may also contain\noperating and financial covenants that could further restrict its operations. There can be no assurance that\nfinancing will be available in a timely manner or in amounts or on terms acceptable to Bitdeer, or at all. A\nlarge amount of bank borrowings and other debt may result in a significant increase in interest expense while\nat the same time exposing Bitdeer to increased interest rate risks. Equity financings could result in dilution to\nBitdeer\u2019s shareholders, and the securities issued in future financings may have rights, preferences and\nprivileges that are senior to those of Bitdeer\u2019s ordinary shares. Any failure to raise needed funds on terms\nfavorable to Bitdeer, or at all, could severely restrict its liquidity as well as have a material adverse effect on\nits business, financial condition and results of operations.\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBitdeer may not be able to maintain its competitive position as cryptocurrency networks experience increases in the\ntotal network hash rate.\nAs the relative market price of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, increases, more companies are\nencouraged to mine for that cryptocurrency and as more mining machines are added to the network, its total\nhash rate increases. In order for Bitdeer to maintain its competitive position under such circumstances,\nBitdeer must increase its total hash rate by acquiring and deploying more mining machines, including new\nmining machines with higher hash rates. There are currently only a few companies capable of producing a\nsufficient number of machines with adequate quality to address the increased demand. If Bitdeer is not able\nto acquire and deploy additional mining machines on a timely basis, its proportion of the overall network\nhash rate will decrease and Bitdeer will have a lower chance of solving new blocks which will have an\nadverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business and results of operations.\nBitdeer has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities and incurred net losses in the past. It can\nprovide no assurance of its future operating results.\nBitdeer had negative cash flows from operating activities in the amount of US$56.6 million, US$109.2\nmillion, US$52.5 million, US$0.7 million and US$151.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and\n2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Bitdeer incurred a net loss of US$27.9\nmillion and US$55.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, generated a net\nprofit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, and incurred a net loss of 25.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Bitdeer has\ngenerated negative cash flow from operating activities and incurred loss in the past, and there is no\nassurance that Bitdeer will be able to generate positive cash flow from operating activities or achieve or\nsubsequently maintain profitability in the future. Bitdeer will need to generate and sustain increased revenue\nand net income levels in future periods in order to increase profitability, and, even if Bitdeer does, Bitdeer\nmay not be able to maintain or increase its level of profitability over the long term. Bitdeer\u2019s ability to\nachieve profitability and positive cash flow from operating activities will depend on a mix of factors, some of\nwhich are beyond its control, including the price of Bitcoin, Bitdeer\u2019s ability to operate and expand its\nbusiness and manage its services mix, and Bitdeer\u2019s ability to secure favorable commercial terms from\nsuppliers.\nBitdeer\u2019s limited operating history and rapid revenue growth may make it difficult for Bitdeer to forecast its\nbusiness and assess the seasonality and volatility in its business.\nBitdeer has achieved rapid growth since its inception. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and\n2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, Bitdeer\u2019s total revenue amounted to US$88.8 million,\nUS$186.4 million, US$394.7 million, US$219.7 million and US$179.6 million, respectively. However, there is no\nassurance that Bitdeer will be able to maintain its historical growth rates in future periods. Bitdeer\u2019s growth\nrates may decline for any number of possible reasons, including decreasing market price of cryptocurrencies,\nincreasing competition, declining growth of the cryptocurrency industry, unforeseeable technology\ninnovation, emergence of alternative mainstream cryptocurrencies, or changes in government policies,\nregulations or general economic conditions. It is also difficult to forecast seasonality and volatility in\nBitdeer\u2019s business, and as a result accurately allocating resources including hash rate, mining farm capacity,\nor human capital to different business lines to achieve the best results in the medium or long term. If\nBitdeer\u2019s growth rates decline, investors\u2019 perceptions of Bitdeer\u2019s business and business prospects may be\nadversely affected and the market price of its ordinary shares could decline. In addition, given the volatile\nnature of cryptocurrencies and that Bitdeer\u2019s business and financial condition correlate with the market price\nof cryptocurrencies, it is difficult to evaluate Bitdeer\u2019s business and future prospects based on its limited\noperating history or historical performance.\nBitdeer has experienced and may experience in the future hash rate loss during its operations due to factors beyond\nits control.\nBitdeer generates hash rate through operating its proprietary mining datacenters. To efficiently increase\nmanaging hash rate (i.e., proprietary hash rate and hosting hash rate), Bitdeer\u2019s efforts include constructing\nand expanding mining datacenters in prime locations globally, purchasing the latest mining machine models\nand continually optimizing operational efficiency of its mining farms and mining machines. However, hash\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrate generation is affected by factors beyond Bitdeer\u2019s control, including temperature, humidity, mining\nmachine quality, the depreciation and deterioration of mining machines, the location of Bitdeer\u2019s mining\nmachines globally, spare parts supply quality, quantity and timeliness, sudden surge in power price or\nsudden power outage, maintenance team members\u2019 lack of experience, unseen computer virus attack, etc. For\nexample, Bitdeer has experienced hash rate loss during 2021, primarily due to relocation of mining machines\nas well as unfavorable weather condition. In the future, Bitdeer expects the risks of hash rate loss will remain,\nwhich may affect its business and results of operations.\nThe estimated numbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus are internally developed by our management. If\nthese estimates prove to be incorrect or inaccurate, our actual operating results may differ materially and adversely\nfrom those forecasted or projected.\nWe included certain estimated numbers in this proxy statement/prospectus, including key selected\nfinancial information of Bitdeer based on the unaudited management accounts of Bitdeer for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and other internally prepared financials and certain key financial information of Bitdeer.\nThe estimated numbers were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or the published\nguidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding the preparation and\npresentation of the estimated numbers. BSGA did not prescribe or relay any instructions, guidelines,\nparameters, inputs, assumptions or other directions to Bitdeer\u2019s management with respect to the estimated\nnumbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus. These estimated numbers should not be viewed as\npublic guidance.\nThe estimated numbers included in this proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the\nresponsibility of, Bitdeer\u2019s management. Neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum LLP or any other\nindependent accountant has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with\nrespect to the estimated numbers contained herein and accordingly, neither MaloneBailey, LLP nor Marcum\nLLP or any other independent accountant expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance on such\ninformation or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the\nestimated numbers. The Marcum LLP report included in this proxy statement/prospectus relates to BSGA\u2019s\nhistorical financial statements. The MaloneBailey, LLP report included in this proxy statement/prospectus\nrelates to Bitdeer\u2019s historical financial statements. Although Bitdeer does not expect its actual results to vary\nmaterially from the unaudited preliminary results included herein, these preliminary numbers are subject to\npotential adjustments that may be identified during Bitdeer\u2019s year-end audit. If Bitdeer\u2019s actual financial\nconditions are not consistent with the preliminary results, whether or not resulting from any potential\nadjustments that are identified during Bitdeer\u2019s year-end audit, it could have an adverse impact on the market\nvaluation of Bitdeer or the financial position of the post-Business Combination entity.\nBitdeer is subject to risks associated with its need for significant electric power and the limited availability of power\nresources, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business requires a significant amount of electric power. The costs of electric power account\nfor a significant portion of Bitdeer\u2019s cost of revenue. Bitdeer requires a significant electric power supply to\nconduct its mining activity, to produce cloud hash rate and to provide hosting services such as powering\nand cooling Bitdeer\u2019s and its customers\u2019 servers and network equipment and operating critical mining and\nhosting infrastructure.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the demand for electricity for cryptocurrency mining, and this\nhas had varying impacts on local electricity supply. Additionally, Bitdeer currently relies on renewable\nsources of power and plans to increase its reliance on renewable sources of power in the future. Renewable\npower is generally an intermittent and variable source of electricity, which may not always be available.\nBecause the electrical grid has very little storage capacity, the balance between electricity supply and\ndemand must be maintained at all times to avoid a blackout or other cascading problem. Intermittent sources\nof renewable power are challenging because they disrupt the conventional methods for planning the daily\noperation of the electrical grid. Their power fluctuates over multiple time horizons, forcing the grid operator\nto adjust its day-ahead, hour-ahead, and real-time operating procedures.\n48 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe amount of power required by Bitdeer and its customers will increase commensurately with the\ndemand for Bitdeer\u2019s services and the increase in mining machines Bitdeer operates for itself and its hosting\ncustomers. Should Bitdeer\u2019s operations require more electricity than can be supplied in the areas where its\nmining facilities are located or should the electrical transmission grid and distribution systems be unable to\nprovide the continuous, steady supply of electricity required, Bitdeer may have to limit or suspend activities\nor reduce the speed of its proposed expansion, either voluntarily or as a result of either quotas imposed by\nenergy companies or governments, or increased prices for certain users (such as Bitdeer). If Bitdeer is unable\nto procure electricity at a suitable price, Bitdeer may have to shut down its operations in that particular\njurisdiction either temporarily or permanently. Therefore, increased power costs and limited availability and\ncurtailment of power resources will reduce Bitdeer\u2019s revenue and have a material and adverse effect on its\ncost of revenue and results of operations. Although Bitdeer aims to build and operate energy efficient\nfacilities, there can be no assurance such facilities will be able to deliver sufficient power to meet the\ngrowing needs of Bitdeer\u2019s business. If Bitdeer is unable to receive adequate power supply and is forced to\nreduce its operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, its business would experience\nmaterially negative impacts.\nCertain government actors have begun to intervene with the supply of electrical energy to\ncryptocurrency miners. For example, recently on March 9, 2023, the Department of the Treasury published\nGeneral Explanations of the Administration\u2019s Fiscal Year 2024 Revenue Proposals, in which it proposed\nimposing a 30% excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners. Governments or government\nregulators may potentially restrict electricity suppliers from providing electricity to mining datacenter in\ntimes of electricity shortage increase the cost, including through taxation, of, electricity, or may otherwise\npotentially restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to businesses like Bitdeer. In the event government\nregulators issue moratoriums or impose bans or restrictions involving hosting operations or transaction\nprocessing in jurisdictions in which it operates, Bitdeer will not be able to continue its operations in such\njurisdictions. A moratorium ban or restriction could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrency mining machines would be materially adversely affected by a\npower outage. Energy costs and availability are vulnerable to risks of outages and power grid damage as a\nresult of inclement weather, animal incursion, sabotage and other events out of Bitdeer\u2019s control. Because\nthe mining portion of Bitdeer\u2019s business consumes a large amount of energy, it is not practical or economical\nfor Bitdeer\u2019s operations to run on back-up generators in the event of a power outage, which may be caused\nby weather, acts of God, wild fires, pandemics, falling trees, falling distribution poles and transmission\ntowers, transmission and distribution cable cuts, other force majeure events in the electricity and natural gas\nmarkets and/or the negligence or malfeasance of others. Any system downtime resulting from insufficient\npower resources or power outages could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIf Bitdeer fails to accurately estimate the factors upon which Bitdeer bases its contract pricing, Bitdeer may\ngenerate less profit than expected or incur losses on those contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s cloud hash rate and hosting contracts are generally priced taking into account various factors\nincluding the then Bitcoin price, network hash rate, purchase cost of mining machines, estimated power\nconsumption by Bitdeer\u2019s clients, along with other costs of products or services, as adjusted for actual\ncosts. Bitdeer\u2019s ability to earn a profit on such contracts requires that Bitdeer accurately estimate the costs\ninvolved and outcomes likely to be achieved and assess the probability of generating sufficient hosting and\ncolocation capacity within the contracted time period. Bitdeer\u2019s pricing of hash rates may cause significantly\nlower income than Bitdeer could have generated through using the same hash rates for proprietary mining.\nBitdeer may also not be able to accurately forecast the outcome of selling its products and services at a\nparticular price and the inability to accurately estimate the factors upon which Bitdeer bases its contract\npricing could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nBitdeer has broad discretion regarding pricing strategy and resource allocation and may exercise related business\njudgments in a way that you may not agree with. Such judgments may not achieve the best possible outcome for its\nbusiness operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business operations involve constant and important decision-making regarding the pricing of\nits services and allocation of mining resources. Bitdeer takes into account its estimates of market trends\nwhen\n49 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermining pricing strategies. To achieve profitability in the long run, Bitdeer may offer lower price in order\nto acquire and retain new customers, even if this pricing does not allow Bitdeer to maximize its short-term\nrevenue. As Bitdeer operates three business lines, Bitdeer has to decide the allocation of proprietary hash\nrate between \u201cproprietary mining\u201d and \u201chash rate sharing\u201d as well as the allocation of mining datacenter\ncapacity among \u201cproprietary mining,\u201d \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and \u201chosting.\u201d While allocating more mining\nresources to \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and \u201chosting\u201d services may facilitate cash payback and mining datacenter\nexpansion while lower risk exposure associated with Bitcoin price volatility, Bitdeer has to forgo its huge\nappreciation potential to some extent as Bitdeer could earn more Bitcoins by allocating the same mining\nresources to \u201cproprietary mining,\u201d and vice versa. Bitdeer spends great efforts in making these business\ndecisions in the Company\u2019s best interest, taking into account Bitcoin price, network hash rate, the amount of\ncash Bitdeer needs and its view on the market opportunities for acquiring mining machines or expanding\nmining datacenters at low cost, etc. However, Bitdeer cannot guarantee that its decisions could generate the\nmost revenue or offer the strongest downside protection for the Company. If Bitdeer cannot accurately\nestimate any of the aforementioned factors upon which Bitdeer bases, its contract pricing could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operation.\nBitdeer faces intense competition and its competitors may employ aggressive pricing strategies, which can lead to a\nprice reduction of Bitdeer\u2019s solutions and services and material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations.\nBitdeer operates in highly competitive industries for cryptocurrency mining and related services, and\nBitdeer may look to enter into markets with very competitive landscapes. Bitdeer\u2019s competitors include many\nwell-known worldwide players, and Bitdeer faces competitors that are larger than itself and have advantages\nover itself in terms of economies of scale and financial and other resources. Bitdeer expects that competition\nin Bitdeer\u2019s markets will continue to be intense. Some of Bitdeer\u2019s competitors may also have stronger brand\nnames, greater access to capital, longer histories, longer relationships with their suppliers or customers and\nmore resources than Bitdeer does. Furthermore, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in the\nindustry more promptly and efficiently. Intense competition from existing and potential competitors could\nresult in material price reductions in the products Bitdeer sells or a decrease in its market share. Aggressive\npricing strategies by Bitdeer\u2019s competitors and an abundant supply of hash rate sharing or hosting services\nin the market may cause Bitdeer to reduce the prices of its services and also negatively affect the demand for\nBitdeer\u2019s services or harm Bitdeer\u2019s profitability. If Bitdeer fails to compete effectively and efficiently or fails\nto adapt to changes in the competitive landscape, Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe average selling prices of Bitdeer\u2019s solutions and services may fluctuate from time to time due to technological\nadvancement and Bitdeer may not be able to pass onto its machine suppliers such decreases, which may in turn\nadversely affect its profitability.\nThe Bitcoin-related industry is characterized by rapid launches of new products, continuous\ntechnological advancements and changing market trends and customer preferences, all of which may\ntranslate to fluctuations in the average selling prices of products or services over time. Because Bitdeer\ncompetes in an environment of rapidly evolving technology advancement, market trends and developments\nof the hash rate sharing and hosting industry, there is no assurance that Bitdeer will be able to pass on any\ndecrease in average selling prices of Bitdeer\u2019s services to its suppliers in a timely manner or at all. In the\nevent that average selling prices of Bitdeer\u2019s services unusually or significantly decrease and such\ndecreases cannot be offset by a corresponding decrease in the prices of the principal components of its\nservices, Bitdeer\u2019s gross profit margins may be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are uncertainties over the outcome of Bitdeer\u2019s mining operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s mining operation comprises blockchain mining technologies that depend on a network of\ncomputers to run certain software programs to solve complex transactions in competition with other mining\noperations and to process transactions. Because of this less centralized model and the complexity of\nBitdeer\u2019s mining operation, there are uncertainties over the likelihood of winning a block reward and hence\nthe outcome of Bitdeer\u2019s mining operations. While Bitdeer participates in mining pools to combine its mining\noperations with other mining participants to increase processing power to solve blocks, there can be no\nassurance that such pools will adequately address this risk.\n50 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is in its early stage and any adverse development in\nthe cryptocurrency or blockchain market could adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business and results of operations.\nBlockchain is a voluntary open network that can be used by anyone with devices connected to the\ninternet. It allows every node to create immutable data, transparent record of transactions and peer-to-peer\ntransactions in an efficient, secure and trust-free manner. Because of such advantages, blockchain can be\napplied to various industries and activities, such as cryptocurrency, payment, financial services, Internet-of-\nThings (IoT), cloud computing and cybersecurity, among others. However, there can be no assurance of\nsuch acceptance in the society. There may not be strong market demand for Bitdeer\u2019s mining services as a\nkey and important process during the application process of blockchain technology, and Bitdeer\u2019s\nprospects, business and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse developments in the blockchain industry could lead to a decrease in the demand for hash rate\nproducts and hosting resources, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Bitdeer faces risks including those related to:\na decline in the adoption and use of Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies within the technology\nindustry or a decline in value of cryptocurrencies\u037e\nincreased costs of complying with existing or new government regulations applicable to\ncryptocurrencies and other factors\u037e\na downturn in the market for blockchain hosting space generally, which could be caused by an\noversupply of or reduced demand for blockchain space\u037e\nany transition by Bitdeer\u2019s customers of blockchain hosting from third-party providers like Bitdeer to\ncustomer-owned and operated facilities\u037e\nthe rapid development of new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards that render\nBitdeer or its customers\u2019 current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and, in the case of\nBitdeer\u2019s customers, that contribute to a downturn in their businesses, increasing the likelihood of a\ndefault under their service agreements or their becoming insolvent\u037e\na slowdown in the growth of the internet generally as a medium for commerce and communication\u037e\navailability of an adequate supply of new generation cryptocurrency mining equipment to enable\nBitdeer to mine cryptocurrencies at scale and for customers who want to purchase hash rate from\nBitdeer or host with Bitdeer to be able to do so\u037e and\nthe degree of difficulty in mining cryptocurrencies and the trading price of such assets.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin, a mainstream cryptocurrency based upon blockchain technology, was first\nintroduced in 2008 and is generally regarded as the first application of the blockchain technology. The\nBitcoin network and its surrounding ecosystem is still in a relatively early development stage.\nCryptocurrencies have only recently become selectively accepted as a means of payment for goods and\nservices by many industries, and use of cryptocurrency by consumers to pay in such industries remains\nlimited. In addition, there may be some jurisdictions that restrict the use of Bitcoins and other\ncryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange and the conversion between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.\nThere is no assurance that usage of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins, will continue to grow. As\nBitdeer\u2019s business focuses on proprietary cryptocurrency mining and serving cryptocurrency miners, and\nrelies heavily on the cryptocurrency market, any lack of usage of or fade in the public interest for\ncryptocurrency may adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, future prospects, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nBitdeer is subject to risks associated with legal, political or other conditions or developments regarding holding,\nusing or mining of cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins, which could negatively affect its business, results of\noperations and financial position.\nBitdeer\u2019s customers are based globally. As such, changes in government policies, taxes, general\neconomic and fiscal conditions, as well as political, diplomatic or social events, expose Bitdeer to financial\nand business risks. In particular, changes in policies and laws regarding holding, using and/or mining of\nBitcoins could result in an adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business operations and results of operations.\nMoreover, if any\n51 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninternational jurisdiction where it operates mining datacenters or sell its Bitcoin mining related services\nprohibits or restricts Bitcoin mining activities, Bitdeer may face legal and other liabilities and will experience a\nmaterial loss of revenue.\nThere are significant uncertainties regarding future regulations pertaining to the holding, using or\nmining of Bitcoins, which may adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations. While Bitcoin has gradually\ngained more market acceptance and attention, it is anonymous and may be used for black market\ntransactions, money laundering, illegal activities or tax evasion. As a result, governments may seek to\nregulate, restrict, control or ban the mining, use and holding of Bitcoins. Bitdeer\u2019s existing policies and\nprocedures for the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorism-funding activities through\nits business activities have only been adopted in recent years and may not completely eliminate instances in\nwhich Bitdeer or its services may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering and other illegal or\nimproper activities. Bitdeer is subject to anti-money laundering laws in many jurisdictions in which it\noperates. Bitdeer cannot assure you that there will not be a failure in detecting money laundering or other\nillegal or improper activities which may adversely affect its reputation, business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWith advances in technology, cryptocurrencies are likely to undergo significant changes in the future. It\nremains uncertain whether Bitcoin will be able to cope with, or benefit from, those changes. In addition, as\nBitcoin mining employs sophisticated and high computing power devices that need to consume a lot of\nelectricity to operate, future developments in the regulation of energy consumption, including possible\nrestrictions on energy usage in the jurisdictions where Bitdeer sells its products or services, may also affect\nBitdeer\u2019s business operations and the demand for Bitdeer\u2019s current and future mining related products or\nservices, including cloud hash rate, hosting and Minerplus. There have been public backlashes surrounding\nthe environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining, particularly the large consumption of electricity, and\ngovernments of various jurisdictions have responded. For example, in the United States, certain local\ngovernments of the State of Washington have discussed measures to address environmental impacts of\nBitcoin-related operations, such as the high electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining activities.\nSubstantial increases in the supply of mining machines connected to the Bitcoin network would lead to an increase\nin network hash rate capacity, which in turn would increase mining difficulty. This development would negatively\naffect the economic returns of Bitcoin mining activities, which would decrease the demand for and/or pricing of\nBitdeer\u2019s products and services.\nThe difficulty of Bitcoin mining, or the amount of computational resource required for a set amount of\nreward for recording a new block, directly affects the expected economic returns for Bitcoin miners, which in\nturn affects Bitdeer\u2019s proprietary mining business and the demand for Bitdeer\u2019s Bitcoin mining related\nproducts and services including hash rate sharing and hosting. Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how\nmuch computing power is required to record a new block and it is affected by the total amount of computing\npower in the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin algorithm is designed to the effect that one block is generated, on\naverage, every ten minutes, no matter how much computing power is in the network. Thus, as more\ncomputing power joins the network, and assuming the rate of block creation does not change (remaining at\none block generated every ten minutes), the amount of computing power required to generate each block and\nhence the mining difficulty increases. In other words, based on the current design of the Bitcoin network,\nBitcoin mining difficulty would increase together with the total computing power available in the Bitcoin\nnetwork, which is in turn affected by the number of Bitcoin mining machines in operation. From January 2019\nto December 2021, Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by approximately 3.3 times, according to Frost &\nSullivan. As a result, a strong growth in promotion of Bitcoin computing power supply services can\ncontribute to further growth in the total computing power in the network, thereby driving up the difficulty of\nBitcoin mining and resulting in downward pressure on the expected economic return of Bitcoin mining and\nthe demand for, and pricing of, Bitdeer\u2019s products and services.\nBitdeer\u2019s business is highly dependent on acquiring a sufficient number of cryptocurrency mining equipment from\nits suppliers. Bitdeer may not be able to obtain new mining hardware or purchase such hardware at competitive\nprices during times of high demand, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business is highly dependent upon cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers providing an\nadequate supply of new generation cryptocurrency mining machines at economical prices to support its\n52 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nproprietary mining, hash rate sharing and hosting business lines and its customers\u2019 mining activities. The\ngrowth in Bitdeer\u2019s business is directly related to increased demand for hosting services and\ncryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin which is dependent in large part on the availability of new generation\nmining machines offered for sale at a price conducive to profitable cryptocurrency mining, as well as the\ntrading price of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The market price and availability of new mining machines\nfluctuates with the price of Bitcoin and can be volatile.\nHistorically, an increase in interest and demand for cryptocurrencies has led to a shortage of mining\nhardware and increased prices. In addition, as more companies seek to enter the mining industry, the demand\nfor machines may outpace supply and create mining machine equipment shortages. There is no assurance\nthat cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers will be able to keep pace with any surge in demand for\nmining equipment. Bitdeer and its customers and the potential customers of Bitdeer\u2019s hosting service may in\nthe future experience difficulty in obtaining new equipment or replacement components for Bitdeer\u2019s and\nthe future experience difficulty in obtaining new equipment or replacement components for Bitdeer\u2019s and\ntheir existing equipment, including graphics processing units and application-specific integrated circuit\nchipsets and computer servers, which in the future may have, a material impact on the demand for Bitdeer\u2019s\nproducts and services and associated revenue. Further, Bitdeer may have little or no recourse in the event a\nmining machine manufacturer or distributor defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If Bitdeer\nand its customers are not able to obtain a sufficient number of cryptocurrency mining machines at favorable\nprices, Bitdeer\u2019s growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be\nnegatively impacted.\nBitdeer relies on supplies from a single or a group of third-party electricity, mining pool services and mining\nmachines providers, and any negative incidents caused by actions taken by them that are outside of Bitdeer\u2019s control\nmay adversely impact Bitdeer\u2019s business and results of operations.\nTo some extent, Bitdeer currently relies on a single or a group of third-party suppliers and service\nproviders to provide quality services to customers. Bitdeer\u2019s brand and reputation may be harmed by actions\ntaken by such third parties that are outside of Bitdeer\u2019s control. For example, Bitdeer is currently contracting\nwith one electricity supplier to support each of its mining farms in Norway, as well as Texas, Tennessee and\nWashington in the United States, respectively. Pursuant to Bitdeer\u2019s agreement with its electricity supplier\nfor the mining datacenter in Hustadvika municipality, Norway, Bitdeer agrees to purchase power at the\namount and price designated in the contract, during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024,\nwhich is the term of this agreement. Pursuant to Bitdeer\u2019s agreement with its electricity supplier for the\nmining datacenter in Tydal municipality, Norway, Bitdeer agrees to purchase power at the amount and price\ndesignated in the contract, during the period from September 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, which is the term\nof this agreement. Both agreements can be completely terminated with zero load ending at midnight of the\nfinal day in each quarter. Pursuant to Bitdeer\u2019s agreement with its electricity supplier in Texas, the supplier\nshall provide electricity to meet full electricity requirements of the two electricity service accounts identified\nby Bitdeer. This contract is effective through December 31, 2026 and is terminable in the event of default.\nPursuant to Bitdeer\u2019s agreement with its electricity supplier in Tennessee, the supplier shall make power\navailable to Bitdeer in the amount designated in the contract. Valid through July 31, 2026, this contract is\nautomatically renewed for additional five years upon expiration of the initial term, unless either party notifies\nthe other in writing not less than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the initial term or any renewal term of\nits desire to terminate this contract on such expiration date. Pursuant to Bitdeer\u2019s agreement with its\nelectricity supplier in Washington, the supplier shall provide power and associated energy to meet Bitdeer\u2019s\ndemand at rates that are subject to adjustment, modification, change or replacement from time to time. This\ncontract remains effective until terminated upon six months prior written notice by Bitdeer. While Bitdeer\nbelieves that alternative suppliers are readily available in the market, changing to a new supplier may require\nadditional costs and time. Bitdeer also sources mining machines from a wide variety of manufacturers and\ntraders with whom it has built relationships over the years. The prices of mining machines were negotiated\non an individual basis, and the agreements typically allow for termination upon either party\u2019s uncured\nmaterial breach, suspension of all or a substantial part of its business, deterioration of its financial position,\nor upon insolvency proceedings against either party. In addition, these agreements may include\nindemnification provisions either for benefit of Bitdeer, or for benefit of the manufacturers and traders. Each\nagreement requires manufacturers and traders to repair or replace the defective part/component of mining\nmachines at no charge to Bitdeer. Despite the measures Bitdeer has taken to ensure the quality of products\nand services provided by third-party suppliers and service providers, to the extent they are unable to\nmaintain their production facilities\u2019 efficiency,\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsupply sufficient products in a timely manner, or provide satisfactory products and services to Bitdeer\u2019s\ncustomers, which may be due to events that are beyond Bitdeer\u2019s or their control, such as manufacturing\ndefects, Bitdeer may suffer reputational damage, and Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected. While Bitdeer has not experienced such incidents that\nhad a material adverse impact on its business as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, as such\nincidents are beyond Bitdeer\u2019s control, there is no assurance that such incidents will not occur in the future\nregardless of the measures Bitdeer has taken, and will take, to maintain the quality products and services\nprovided by third-party suppliers and service providers. If Bitdeer is unable to effectively address these\nrisks, its brand image, reputation and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, Bitdeer utilizes third-party mining pools to receive its mining rewards from a given\nnetwork. Mining pools allow mining participants to combine their processing power, which increases the\nchances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool\noperators, proportionally to Bitdeer\u2019s contribution to the pools\u2019 overall mining power used to solve a block.\nBitdeer entered into agreements with mining pool operators who deliver cryptocurrency rewards to accounts\nof Bitdeer or Bitdeer\u2019s customers in exchange for hash rate provided by Bitdeer and Bitdeer\u2019s Cloud Hash\nRate customers. The agreements are terminable through mutual agreement between both parties or due to a\nbreach of the contract which is not cured within two days upon receiving notice from the non-breaching\nparty. Due to the competitiveness of the global mining pool industry, Bitdeer believes that it will be able to\npromptly access alternative mining pools if needed. Nevertheless, Bitdeer is dependent on the accuracy of a\nmining pool operator\u2019s record keeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool\nfor a given Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining application in order to assess the proportion of that total\nprocessing power Bitdeer provided. While Bitdeer has internal methods of tracking both Bitdeer\u2019s power\nprovided and the total power used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own record-keeping to\ndetermine Bitdeer\u2019s proportion of a given reward. Bitdeer has little means of recourse against the mining pool\noperator if Bitdeer determines the proportion of the reward paid out to Bitdeer by a mining pool operator is\nincorrect, other than leaving the pools or entering into a lengthy negotiation with the third-party mining\npools to get back the fair rewards. If Bitdeer is unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards\nfrom its mining pool operators, Bitdeer may experience reduced reward for its efforts, which would have an\nadverse effect on its business and operations.\nFailure to keep Bitdeer\u2019s solutions and services up-to-date in line with the approximate level of market demand\ncould cause Bitdeer to lose sales, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn order to operate its business successfully and meet the demands and expectations of its customers,\nBitdeer must maintain a certain level of equipment, including but not limited to mining machines, to sustain\nlarge scale service when required. Furthermore, Bitdeer is required to maintain an appropriate level of\nequipment for any unexpected emergency substitute or in preparation of potential outage and sudden\nservice loss. However, forecasts are inherently uncertain. If Bitdeer\u2019s forecasted demand is lower than actual\ndemand or Bitdeer\u2019s risk estimate is much sufficient, Bitdeer may not be able to provide its customers with\nsufficient hash rate sharing or hosting services in a timely manner, and Bitdeer may lose sales and market\nshare to its competitors.\nBitdeer may be unable to execute its growth strategies or effectively maintain its rapid growth trends.\nBitdeer has experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded its business in recent years. Bitdeer\u2019s\ntotal net revenue increased by 110.0% from US$88.8 million in 2019 to US$186.4 million in 2020, and further\nincreased by 111.7% to US$394.7 million in 2021. For the first six months in 2022, Bitdeer generated US$179.6\nmillion in total net revenue, as compared to US$219.7 million generated for the first six months in 2021.\nBitdeer incurred a net loss of US$27.9 million and US$55.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and\n2020, respectively, generated a net profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and incurred a net loss of US$25.2 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022. Bitdeer may not be able to grow its revenue and achieve profitability in the\nfuture if Bitdeer is not able to successfully execute its product development and diversification, geographic\nexpansion and other growth plans. In addition, Bitdeer\u2019s rapid growth has placed and will continue to place\nsignificant demands on its management and its administrative, operational, research and development and\nfinancial resources.\n54 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo accomplish Bitdeer\u2019s growth strategies and manage the future growth of its operations, Bitdeer will\nbe required to enhance its research and development capabilities, improve its operational and financial\nsystems, and expand, train and manage its growing employee base. Furthermore, Bitdeer needs to maintain\nand expand its relationships with Bitdeer\u2019s customers, suppliers, research institutions, third-party\nmanufacturers and other third parties. Moreover, as Bitdeer introduces new products or services or enter\nnew markets, Bitdeer may face new market, technological, operational and regulatory risks and challenges\nwith which it is unfamiliar.\nBitdeer\u2019s current and planned operations, personnel, systems, internal procedures and controls may not\nbe adequate to support Bitdeer\u2019s future growth and expansion. In addition, the success of Bitdeer\u2019s growth\nstrategies depends on a number of external factors, such as the development of the cryptocurrency market\nand the demand for Bitcoin, the level of competition Bitdeer faces and evolving customer behavior and\npreferences. If Bitdeer is unable to execute its growth strategies or manage its growth effectively, Bitdeer\nmay not be able to capture market opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which may materially\nand adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business prospects and results of operations.\nMoreover, Bitdeer\u2019s ability to generate profits and/or positive cash flow is correlated to the current and\nfuture market prices of cryptocurrencies and a decline in the market prices for cryptocurrencies could\nnegatively impact Bitdeer\u2019s future operations. For example, the recent decreases in Bitcoin price resulted\nfrom the FTX bankruptcy is expected to negatively impact Bitdeer\u2019s mining yields. However, Bitdeer believes\nthat, as compared to many other participants in the crypto assets markets, Bitdeer is more resilient to\ncryptocurrency price volatility as its \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and \u201chosting\u201d businesses allow Bitdeer to smooth\nthe impact of cryptocurrency price volatility. For more details regarding the two business lines, see the\nsections entitled \u201cInformation Related to Bitdeer\u202f-\u202fOur Strengths\u202f-\u202fUnique business model powers organic\nhash rate expansion by generating instant and continuous cash\u201d and \u201cInformation Related to Bitdeer\u202f-\u202fOur\nBusiness Lines and Software Infrastructure.\u201d In addition, Bitdeer expects its \u201cproprietary mining\u201d business\nline to continue to recoup cash, unless the Bitcoin price experiences a drastic drop. For a breakeven analysis\nin this regard, see the section entitled \u201cBitdeer\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations\u202f-\u202fKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\u202f-\u202fPrice and volatility\nof Bitcoin.\u201d For risks relating to the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuation of Bitdeer\u2019s operations, see the\nsection entitled \u201c- Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be significantly\nimpacted by Bitcoin price fluctuation\u201d above.\nIn addition, Bitdeer also faces risks associated with the expansion of its operations overseas. See the\nsection entitled \u201c- Bitdeer faces risks associated with the expansion of its scale of operations globally, and if\nBitdeer is unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair Bitdeer\u2019s ability to expand its business\nabroad.\u201d If Bitdeer is not able to manage its growth or execute its strategies effectively, Bitdeer\u2019s expansion\nmay not be successful and its business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nBitdeer faces risks associated with the expansion of its scale of operations globally, and if Bitdeer is unable to\neffectively manage these risks, they could impair Bitdeer\u2019s ability to expand its business abroad.\nBitdeer operates its business globally, with customers and suppliers located in various countries. As\nBitdeer continues to grow its business and expand its operations globally, it will continue to sell its products\nand services into new jurisdictions in which Bitdeer has limited or no experience and in which Bitdeer\u2019s\nbrands may be less recognized. Bitdeer\u2019s global operation exposes it to a number of risks, including:\na limited customer base and limited sales and relationships with international customers\u037e\ndifficulty in managing multinational operations\u037e\ncompetitors in overseas markets who have stronger ties with local customers and greater resources\u037e\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates\u037e\nchallenges in providing customer products and services and support in these markets\u037e\nchallenges in managing Bitdeer\u2019s overseas sales force and implementing sales strategies effectively\u037e\nunexpected transportation delays or interruptions or increases in international transportation costs\u037e\n55 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndifficulties in and costs of exporting products overseas while complying with the different\ncommercial, legal and regulatory requirements of the overseas markets in which Bitdeer offers its\nproducts and services\u037e\nregulations, changes to regulation, regulatory uncertainty in or inconsistent regulations across\nvarious jurisdictions that may implicate cryptocurrency mining and other cryptocurrency activities\u037e\ndifficulty in ensuring the compliance with the sanctions imposed by The Office of Financial Assets\nControl of the U.S. Department of Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the European Union or the United Nations\nSecurity Council on various foreign states, organizations and individuals\u037e\ninability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights in all the jurisdictions Bitdeer\noperates in\u037e\ninability to effectively enforce contractual or legal rights or intellectual property rights in certain\njurisdictions under which Bitdeer operates\u037e\nchanges in a specific country or region\u2019s political or economic conditions or policies\u037e and\ngovernmental policies favoring domestic companies in certain foreign markets or trade barriers\nincluding export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and charges. In particular, there\nhave been concerns over the worldwide populism trend that call for protectionism trade policy and\npotential international trade disputes, all of which could cause turbulence in the international markets.\nThese government policies or trade barriers could increase the prices of Bitdeer\u2019s products and\nservices and make Bitdeer less competitive in such countries.\nIf Bitdeer is unable to effectively manage these risks, Bitdeer ability to operate and expand its business\nwill be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nAs Bitdeer continues to expand and localize its international activities, its obligations to comply with the laws, rules,\nregulations and policies of a variety of jurisdictions will increase and it may be subject to investigations and\nenforcement actions by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental authorities.\nAs Bitdeer expands and localizes its international activities, it has become increasingly obligated to\ncomply with the laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations not only the jurisdictions in which\nit operates but also those into which it offers services on a cross-border basis. Laws regulating financial\nservices, the internet, mobile technologies, crypto, and related technologies outside the United States often\nimpose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on Bitdeer, as well as broader liability.\nRegulators worldwide frequently study each other\u2019s approaches to the regulation of the crypto\neconomy. Consequently, developments in any jurisdiction may influence other jurisdictions. New\ndevelopments in one jurisdiction may be extended to additional services and other jurisdictions. As a result,\nthe risks created by any new law or regulation in one jurisdiction are magnified by the potential that they\nmay be replicated, affecting Bitdeer\u2019s business in another place or involving another service. Conversely, if\nregulations diverge worldwide, Bitdeer may face difficulty adjusting its products, services, and other aspects\nof its business with the same effect. These risks are heightened as Bitdeer faces increased competitive\npressure from other similarly situated businesses that engage in regulatory arbitrage to avoid the compliance\ncosts associated with regulatory changes.\nThe complexity of U.S. federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled\nwith the global scope of Bitdeer\u2019s operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in\na single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings\nby multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in\nthe aggregate, harm Bitdeer\u2019s reputation, damage its brands and business, and adversely affect its operating\nresults and financial condition. Due to the uncertain application of existing laws and regulations, it is\npossible that, despite Bitdeer\u2019s regulatory and legal analysis concluding that certain products and services\nare currently unregulated, such products or services may indeed be subject to financial regulation, licensing,\nor authorization obligations that Bitdeer has not obtained or with which it has not complied. As a result,\nBitdeer is at a heightened risk of enforcement action, litigation, regulatory, and legal scrutiny which could\nlead to sanctions,\n56 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncease, and desist orders, or other penalties and censures which could significantly and adversely affect its\ncontinued operations and financial condition.\nDelays in the expansion of existing mining datacenters or the construction of new mining datacenters or significant\ncost overruns could present significant risks to Bitdeer\u2019s business and could have a material adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe daily operations of all Bitdeer\u2019s business lines require the support of its mining datacenters, with a\nhighly specialized infrastructure and considerable, reliable power in order to compete effectively. Bitdeer\nintends to increase its mining capacity and increase substantially the number of mining machines Bitdeer\noperates. In order to meet its financial plan, Bitdeer needs to expand its existing mining datacenters or obtain\nsuitable land to build new mining datacenters. Bitdeer may face challenges in obtaining suitable land, as\nBitdeer needs to work closely with the local power suppliers and local governments of the places where\nBitdeer\u2019s proposed facilitates are located. Delays in actions that require the assistance of such third parties,\nin receiving required permits and approvals or in mediations with local communities, if any, may negatively\nimpact Bitdeer\u2019s construction timelines and budget or result in any new facilities not being completed at all.\nBitdeer plans to expand its footprints to six mining datacenters across the globe to increase Bitdeer\u2019s\ntotal capacity to approximately 1,374MW, including 452MW power supply currently under construction and\n400MW power supply \u201cin the pipeline,\u201d contracted but not yet under active construction. Such expansion\nand construction require Bitdeer to rely on the experience of one or more designers, general contractors and\nsubcontractors, and such designers or contractors may experience financial or other problems during the\ndesign or construction process. Bitdeer may also experience quality control issues as Bitdeer implements any\nupgrades in its hosting capacity through the installation and maintenance of chipsets and servers or new\ncooling technologies such as immersion and water curtain cooling. Bitdeer\u2019s business will be negatively\nimpacted if Bitdeer is unable to run its mining operations in a way that is technologically advanced,\neconomically and energy-efficient and temperature controlled. If Bitdeer is unsuccessful, it will damage its\nmining machines and the mining machines of third parties and the profitability of its mining operations.\nIf Bitdeer experiences significant delays in the supply of power required to support any mining\ndatacenter expansion or construction, the progress of such projects could deviate from Bitdeer\u2019s original\nplans, which could cause material and negative effects on Bitdeer\u2019s revenue growth, profitability and results\nof operations. Any material delay in completing these projects, or any substantial cost increases or quality\nissues in connection with these projects, could materially delay Bitdeer\u2019s ability to supply cloud hash rate\nand deliver its hosting capacity, cause Bitdeer to incur penalties under hosting contracts, result in reduced\norder volume and materially adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAny failure of Bitdeer\u2019s solutions or services to meet the necessary quality standards could adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s\nreputation, business and results of operation.\nThe quality of the products and services Bitdeer is providing is critical to the success of its business\nand depends significantly on the effectiveness of Bitdeer\u2019s and Bitdeer\u2019s manufacturing service providers\u2019\nquality control systems. In its efforts to quickly meet new market trends and demand and adopt new\ntechnologies, Bitdeer\u2019s products and services may not have adequate time to go through Bitdeer\u2019s normal\nrigorous testing procedures and final inspection, which could result in instances where Bitdeer\u2019s products\nand services cannot reach the required performance standard, or Bitdeer\u2019s products and services are found\nto be defective or significantly unsatisfying. These instances could result in Bitdeer\u2019s customers suffering\nlosses. Defects detected before products and services performance to Bitdeer\u2019s customers may result in\nadditional costs for remediation and rework. Defects detected after the performance of Bitdeer\u2019s products\nand services may result in Bitdeer\u2019s incurring further costs relating to inspection, installation or remediation,\nwhich may result in damages to Bitdeer\u2019s reputation, loss of customers, government fines and disputes and\nlitigation.\nOn the other hand, Bitdeer may have to turn to less reputable suppliers if Bitdeer cannot source\nadequate equipment or other supplies from its regular suppliers. Under such circumstances, the quality of\nthe equipment may suffer and could cause performance issues in Bitdeer\u2019s products and services. Shortages\nof supplies could result in reduced production or delays in production, as well as an increase in costs, which\nmay negatively affect Bitdeer\u2019s abilities to fulfill orders or provide timely services to customers, as well as\nBitdeer\u2019s customer relationships and profitability. Supplies shortages may also increase Bitdeer\u2019s costs of\nrevenue because it may\n57 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbe required to pay higher prices for products in short supply, without being able to pass such cost to\ncustomers. As a result, Bitdeer\u2019s business, results of operations and reputation could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nPower outage or shortages, labor disputes and other factors may result in constraints on Bitdeer\u2019s business\nactivities.\nHistorically, Bitdeer has not experienced constraints on its business activities, including at its mining\ndatacenters, due to power outage or shortages, labor disputes or other factors. However, there can be no\nassurance that Bitdeer\u2019s operations will not be affected by power outage or shortages, labor disputes or\nother factors in the future, thereby causing material disruptions and delays in Bitdeer\u2019s delivery schedule. In\nsuch an event, Bitdeer\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nIf Bitdeer is unable to maintain or enhance its brand recognition, its business, financial condition and results of\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\nMaintaining and enhancing the recognition, image and acceptance of Bitdeer\u2019s brand are important to\nBitdeer\u2019s ability to differentiate its products and services from and to compete effectively with its peers. As\nBitdeer relies heavily on word-of-mouth branding, Bitdeer\u2019s brand image could be jeopardized if it fails to\nmaintain high product and service quality, pioneer and keep pace with evolving technology trends, or timely\nfulfil the orders for its products and services. If Bitdeer fails to promote its brand or to maintain or enhance\nthe brand recognition and awareness among Bitdeer\u2019s customers, or if Bitdeer is subject to events or\nnegative allegations affecting its brand image or publicly perceived position of its brand, Bitdeer\u2019s business,\noperating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBitdeer may be at a higher risk of litigation and other legal proceedings due to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the\ncryptocurrency industry, which could ultimately be resolved against Bitdeer, requiring material future cash\npayments or charges, and accordingly impair Bitdeer\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of Bitdeer\u2019s business could make it susceptible to various claims, both\nin litigation and binding arbitration proceedings, legal proceedings, and government investigations, due to\nthe heightened regulatory scrutiny following the recent disruptions in the crypto asset markets. Bitdeer\nbelieves that since cryptocurrency mining, and the digital asset industry generally, is a relatively new\nbusiness sector, it is more likely subject to government investigation and regulatory determination,\nparticularly following the recent cryptocurrency market participant bankruptcies described elsewhere herein.\nAny claims, regulatory proceedings or litigation that could arise in the course of Bitdeer\u2019s business could\nhave a material adverse effect on Bitdeer, its business or operations, or the industry as a whole.\nBitdeer may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer may not be able to obtain broad protection in Singapore, the United States or internationally for\nall of its existing and future intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and Bitdeer may not be able to\nobtain effective protection for its intellectual property and other proprietary rights in every country in which\nBitdeer operates. Protecting Bitdeer\u2019s intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights may require\nsignificant expenditure of its financial, managerial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps that\nBitdeer may take to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to\nprotect such rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating such rights. Any of Bitdeer\u2019s\nintellectual property rights and other proprietary rights, whether registered, unregistered, issued or\nunissued, may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative proceedings and/or litigation.\nBitdeer may be required to spend significant resources to secure, maintain, monitor and protect its\nintellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Despite its efforts, Bitdeer may not be able to\nprevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating Bitdeer\u2019s intellectual\nproperty rights and other proprietary rights. Bitdeer may initiate claims, administrative proceedings and/or\nlitigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of its intellectual property rights or\nother proprietary rights to enforce and/or maintain the validity of such rights. Any such action, if initiated,\nwhether or not it is resolved in Bitdeer\u2019s favor, could result in significant expense to Bitdeer, and divert the\nefforts of its\n58 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntechnical and management personnel, which may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nBitdeer may face intellectual property infringement claims or other related disputes, which could be time-\nconsuming, costly to defend or settle and result in the loss of significant rights and lower sales.\nAs is typical in the cryptocurrency industry, Bitdeer may be subject to infringement claims from time to\ntime or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by\nother parties that may cover some of Bitdeer\u2019s technology, products and services. The cryptocurrency\nindustry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property\nrights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce these rights. Patent litigation has increased in recent\nyears owing to increased assertions made by intellectual property licensing entities and increasing\ncompetition and overlap of product functionality in Bitdeer\u2019s markets. Additionally, Bitdeer has in the past\nentered and may continue in the future to enter into licensing agreements with third parties for the use of\ntheir proprietary technologies, primarily software development tools, in the development of Bitdeer\u2019s\nproducts and services. As with any business relationship, Bitdeer may face disputes and lawsuits related to\nthose intellectual property licensing agreements. As its operations continue to grow in size and scale, the\nlikelihood of Bitdeer becoming involved in intellectual property related lawsuits and disputes to protect or\ndefend its intellectual property rights and the use of third-party intellectual property rights will increase.\nIn addition, it is extremely difficult for Bitdeer to monitor all of the patent applications that have been\nfiled in the United States or in other countries or regions and whether, if such pending patents are granted,\nsuch patents would have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business if Bitdeer\u2019s service offering\nwere to infringe upon them.\nOther third parties may file claims against Bitdeer or its customers alleging that Bitdeer\u2019s products and\nservices, processes, or technologies infringe third-party patents or IP rights. Regardless of their merits or\nresolutions, such claims could be costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of\nBitdeer\u2019s management and technical personnel. In addition, some of Bitdeer\u2019s customer agreements in the\nfuture may require Bitdeer to indemnify and defend its customers from third-party infringement claims and to\npay damages in the case of adverse rulings. As such, claims of this sort also could harm Bitdeer\u2019s\nrelationships with its customers and may deter future customers from doing business with Bitdeer. Bitdeer\ndoes not know whether Bitdeer could prevail in any such proceeding given the complex technical issues and\ninherent uncertainties involved in intellectual property litigation. If any pending or future proceedings result\nin an adverse outcome, Bitdeer could be required to:\ncease the use of the infringing equipment, processes or technologies\u037e\nstop providing products and services to certain geographic areas\u037e\npay substantial damages for infringement\u037e\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing processes, technologies or products\u037e\nlicense technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all\u037e\ncross-license Bitdeer\u2019s technology to a competitor in order to resolve an infringement claim, which\ncould weaken Bitdeer\u2019s ability to compete with that competitor\u037e or\npay substantial damages to Bitdeer\u2019s customers to disruption of products and services they\nsubscribed or replace the type of series with non-infringing equipment involved.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe loss of any member of Bitdeer\u2019s senior management team, or Bitdeer\u2019s failure to attract, train and retain\nqualified personnel, especially its design and technical personnel, could impair Bitdeer\u2019s ability to grow its business\nand effectively execute its business strategy.\nSince its inception, the growth and expansion of Bitdeer\u2019s business operations have been dependent\nupon the business strategies and foresight of Bitdeer\u2019s senior management. Bitdeer\u2019s future success\ndepends, in a\n59 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlarge part, on the continued contributions of its senior management team, specifically Mr. Jihan Wu. In\naddition, Bitdeer\u2019s future success depends on its ability to retain, attract and incentivize qualified personnel,\nincluding its management, sales, marketing, finance and especially research and development personnel. As\nthe driver of Bitdeer\u2019s technological and product innovations, Bitdeer\u2019s research and development personnel\nrepresent a very significant asset of Bitdeer\u2019s. As the technology in the cryptocurrency industry is\nadvancing at a quick pace, there is an increasing need for skilled engineers. Many companies across the\nworld are struggling to find suitable candidates for their research and development positions. The process of\nhiring employees with the combination of skills and characteristics required to implement Bitdeer\u2019s strategy\ncan be extremely competitive and time-consuming. Bitdeer cannot assure you that it will be able to attract\nadequate personnel as Bitdeer continues to pursue its business strategies.\nMoreover, there is no assurance that Bitdeer will be able to retain key existing employees. The loss of\nany of Bitdeer\u2019s founder, senior management or research and development team members could harm it\nability to implement it business strategies and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which it\noperates, or could result in other operating risks. The loss of one or more of Bitdeer\u2019s key employees,\nespecially its key design and technical personnel, or its inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified\ndesigns and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nBitdeer may be vulnerable to security breaches, which could disrupt its operations and have a material adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA party who is able to compromise the physical security measures protecting Bitdeer\u2019s facilities could\ncause interruptions or malfunctions in Bitdeer\u2019s operations and misappropriate Bitdeer\u2019s property or the\nproperty of its customers. Such a compromise could be particularly harmful to Bitdeer\u2019s brand and\nreputation. Bitdeer may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such\nthreats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. As techniques used to breach security\nchange frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, Bitdeer may not be able to\nimplement new security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, Bitdeer may not be certain\nwhether these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose Bitdeer to\nincreased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to Bitdeer\u2019s\nreputation and increases in Bitdeer\u2019s security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, any assertions of alleged security breaches or systems failure made against Bitdeer,\nwhether true or not, could harm its reputation, cause Bitdeer to incur substantial legal fees and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Whether or not\nany such assertion actually develops into litigation, Bitdeer\u2019s management may be required to devote\nsignificant time and attention to dispute resolution (through litigation, settlement or otherwise), which would\ndetract from Bitdeer\u2019s management\u2019s ability to focus on its business. Any such resolution could involve the\npayment of damages or expenses by Bitdeer, which may be significant. In addition, any such resolution\ncould involve Bitdeer\u2019s agreement with terms that restrict the operation of its business. Any such resolution,\nincluding the resources exhausted in connection therewith, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent\nconcern in the Bitcoin exchange market since the launch of the Bitcoin network. Any security breach caused\nby hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause\nintentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and\nthe inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm Bitdeer\u2019s business operations or result in loss\nof Bitdeer\u2019s assets.\nBitdeer may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite Bitdeer\u2019s\nefforts and processes to prevent breaches, its computer servers and computer systems may be vulnerable to\ncybersecurity risks, including denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or\n60 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmisuse and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with Bitdeer\u2019s computer servers and computer\nsystems. The preventive actions Bitdeer takes to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect its\ninformation technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future. To the\nextent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to Bitdeer\u2019s network, in\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information or in a loss of Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies, it could cause\nsignificant damage to its reputation, lead to claims against it and ultimately have a material adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, Bitdeer may be required to\nincur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the\nfuture.\nBitdeer may engage in acquisitions or strategic alliances in the future that could disrupt Bitdeer\u2019s business, result in\nincreased expenses, reduce Bitdeer\u2019s financial resources and cause dilution to Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders. Bitdeer\ncannot assure you that such acquisitions or strategic alliances may be successfully implemented.\nAlthough Bitdeer has not engaged in acquisitions or strategic alliances in the past, it may look for\npotential acquisitions or strategic alliances in the future to expand its business. However, Bitdeer may not be\nable to find suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, or integrate\nany acquired business, products or technologies into Bitdeer\u2019s operations. If Bitdeer does complete\nacquisitions, they may be viewed negatively by customers or investors and they may not enable Bitdeer to\nstrengthen its competitive position or achieve its goals. In addition, any acquisitions that Bitdeer makes\ncould lead to difficulties in integrating personnel, technologies and operations from the acquired businesses\nand in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. Moreover, acquisitions may disrupt\nBitdeer\u2019s ongoing operations, divert management from day-to-day responsibilities and increase Bitdeer\u2019s\nexpenses. Future acquisitions may reduce Bitdeer\u2019s cash available for operations and other uses, and could\nresult in increases in amortization expenses related to identifiable intangible assets acquired, potentially\ndilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt. Bitdeer cannot predict the number, timing or\nsize of future acquisitions, or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on Bitdeer\u2019s operating results.\nAny global systemic economic and financial crisis could negatively affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, results of operations,\nand financial condition.\nAny prolonged slowdown in the global economy may have a negative impact on Bitdeer\u2019s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition. The global financial markets have experienced significant\ndisruptions since 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies have experienced periods of\nrecession. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and\nfiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world\u2019s leading\neconomies, including the United States. There have also been concerns over unrest in Ukraine, the Middle\nEast and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in financial and other markets, and concerns over the\naftermath of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union as well as the significant potential changes to\nUnited States trade policies, treaties and tariffs. There were and could be in the future a number of domino\neffects from such turmoil on Bitdeer\u2019s business, including significant decreases in orders from its customers,\ninsolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance\npurchases of Bitdeer\u2019s products and services and/or customer insolvencies, and counterparty failures\nnegatively impacting Bitdeer\u2019s operations. Any systemic economic or financial crisis could cause revenue for\nthe semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically and could materially and adversely affect\nBitdeer\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in international trade policies and international barriers to trade may have an adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness and expansion plans.\nBitdeer has provided worldwide products and services to a number of countries outside of Singapore\nand derive sales from exporting to those countries, and Bitdeer intends to continue to sell its current and\nfuture products to countries outside of Singapore. Revenue generated from customers located in the United\nStates accounted for 12%, 17%, 19% and 6% of Bitdeer\u2019s total revenue for the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Further, Bitdeer relies on\ncertain overseas suppliers, including suppliers in the United States, for the supply of certain equipment and\ntools, such as mining machines. Changes to trade policies, treaties and tariffs in or affecting the jurisdictions\nin which Bitdeer operates and to which Bitdeer sells its products and services, or the perception that these\nchanges could occur,\n61 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncould adversely affect the financial and economic conditions in those jurisdictions, as well as Bitdeer\u2019s\ninternational sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business and prospect may be negatively affected by changes in governmental policies\nincluding sanctions and export controls administered by other countries\u2019 governments, including those\nimposed as a result of an increasing tense relationship of the political or economic relations among major\neconomic groups and other geopolitical challenges. Although Bitdeer currently only operates its business in\ncertain countries, there is no assurance that the governmental authorities may take certain possible measures\nor restrictions towards the products and services Bitdeer is providing or will provide, which could result in\nan adverse impact on Bitdeer\u2019s business and prospect if Bitdeer were not able to find substitute customer\ngroup with the same quality demand from other countries. Further, some of Bitdeer\u2019s customers may\nexperience undue hardship in purchasing or furthering the business relationship with it as a result of the\nabnormal international trade relations, which could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business\nperformance.\nIn addition, countries, which are subject to other countries\u2019 sanctions or tariff impositions may further\nretaliate, in response to new trade policies implemented by such foreign governments. Such retaliation\nmeasures may further escalate the tensions between the two countries, which may have a negative impact on\nthe economies of not merely the two countries concerned, but the global economy as a whole. As a result of\nany major economic downturn, Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nBitdeer\u2019s prepayments to suppliers may subject it to counterparty risk associated with such suppliers and negatively\naffect Bitdeer\u2019s liquidity and cash position.\nBitdeer is required to prepay some of its suppliers before the service is provided to secure the supplier\u2019s\nproduction capacity. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021 and June 30, 2022, the balance of prepayments\nBitdeer made to its suppliers amounted to US$5.8 million, US$14.5 million and US$13.7 million, respectively.\nThe amount of Bitdeer\u2019s prepayment can significantly increase as it continues to pursue technological\nadvancement. Bitdeer is subject to counterparty risk exposure to its suppliers. Any failure by Bitdeer\u2019s\nsuppliers to perform their contractual obligation in a timely manner and/or with Bitdeer\u2019s requested quality\nmay result in it not being able to fulfill customers\u2019 orders accordingly. In such an event, Bitdeer may not be\nable to regain the prepayment in a timely manner or in full, even though Bitdeer\u2019s suppliers are obligated to\nreturn such prepayments under specified circumstances as previously agreed upon. Furthermore, if the cash\noutflows for the prepayments significantly exceed the cash inflows during any period, Bitdeer\u2019s future\nliquidity position will be adversely affected.\nConcerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change may result in environmental taxes, charges,\nassessments or penalties and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nThe effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific\nattention, as well as the attention of the United States and other foreign governments. Efforts are being made\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from coal combustion power plants, some of which\nplants Bitdeer may rely upon for power. The added cost of any environmental taxes, charges, assessments or\npenalties levied on such power plants could be passed on to Bitdeer, increasing the cost to run Bitdeer\u2019s\nhosting facilities.\nOn November 23, 2022, the governor of New York signed into law a two year moratorium on new or\nrenewed permits for certain electricity-generating facilities that use fossil fuel and provide energy for proof-\nof-work digital asset mining operations. While this action does not directly impact Bitdeer\u2019s current\noperations, it may be the beginning of a new wave of climate change regulations aimed at preventing or\nreducing the growth of Bitcoin mining in jurisdictions in the United States, including potentially jurisdictions\nin which Bitdeer now operates or may in the future operate. Such action could also demonstrate the\nbeginning of a regional or global regulatory trend in response to environmental and energy preservation or\nother concerns surrounding crypto assets, and similar action in a jurisdiction in which Bitdeer operates or in\ngeneral could have a devastating effect on its operations. Any further enactment of laws or promulgations of\nregulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States, Norway, or any other domestic or\nforeign jurisdiction\n62 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin which Bitdeer conducts business could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nIf Bitdeer experiences difficulty in collecting its trade receivables, its liquidity, financial condition and results of\noperations would be negatively impacted.\nBitdeer derives its revenue from the sale of products and services and is subject to counterparty risks\nsuch as its customer\u2019s inability to pay. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and June 30, 2022, Bitdeer\u2019s trade\nreceivables amounted to US$0.4 million, US$8.2 million, and US$20.7 million respectively. There can be no\nassurance that Bitdeer will be able to collect its trade receivables on a timely basis, and its trade receivable\nturnover days may increase, which in turn could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s liquidity, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s operations and those of its production partners and customers are vulnerable to natural disasters and\nother events beyond Bitdeer\u2019s control, the occurrence of which may have an adverse effect on the supply chain of\nBitdeer\u2019s suppliers and on Bitdeer\u2019s facilities, personnel and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business could be adversely affected by natural disasters or outbreaks of epidemics. Bitdeer\nhas not adopted any written contingency plans to combat any future natural disasters, such as floods and\nmudslides, or outbreaks of avian flu, H1N1 flu, SARS or any other epidemic. These natural disasters,\noutbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments in countries where\nBitdeer\u2019s computing power facilities are located or any other countries or regions in which Bitdeer conducts\nbusiness could severely disrupt its business operations by damaging Bitdeer\u2019s network infrastructure or\ninformation technology system or impacting the productivity of Bitdeer\u2019s workforce, which may adversely\naffect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significantly negative impact on the global economy, industry and market\nconditions. The ongoing development and the global control on the pandemic are unclear, which may increase the\ninstability of Bitdeer\u2019s development, materially and adversely affecting Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations.\nSince December 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 has\nmaterially and adversely affected the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused series of\nconsequences from many perspectives and may continue to have a prolonged impact by:\nimpairing Bitdeer\u2019s ability to renew and maintain its relationships with existing customers\u037e\ncausing Bitdeer\u2019s existing customers to substantially reduce the quantity of products and services to\nwhich they subscribe, seek price concessions, or go out of business, any of which would harm\nBitdeer\u2019s revenue\u037e\nresulting in some of Bitdeer\u2019s customers failing to comply with the terms of their agreements,\nincluding payment terms, due to economic uncertainty, financial hardship, and even failure of their\nbusinesses, which could result in Bitdeer being required to take action to collect payments, terminate\ntheir subscriptions for Bitdeer\u2019s services, and increase accounts receivable and bad debt, any of\nwhich would increase Bitdeer\u2019s expenses and harm Bitdeer\u2019s revenue and results of operations\u037e\nmaking it more difficult for Bitdeer to sell increased services or functionality to its existing customers\u037e\ndelaying prospective customers\u2019 decisions to subscribe to Bitdeer\u2019s solutions, increase the length of\nsales cycles, or slow the typical growth in the use of Bitdeer\u2019s solutions once customers have initially\ndeployed its solutions\u037e\nharming Bitdeer\u2019s ability to effectively market and sell its solutions as a result of travel restrictions\nand social distancing orders\u037e\ndelaying the introduction of enhancements to Bitdeer\u2019s solutions and market acceptance of any new\nfeatures and products\u037e\nharming Bitdeer\u2019s ability to grow its worldwide sales and operations\u037e\nharming Bitdeer\u2019s ability to recruit, onboard and successfully integrate new employees, including\nmembers of its direct sales force\u037e\n63 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nimpacting the health and safety of Bitdeer\u2019s employees, including its senior management team, and\ntheir ability to perform services\u037e\ncausing Bitdeer\u2019s management team to continue to commit significant time, attention and resources to\nmonitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to mitigate its effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business and\nworkforce.\nIt is uncertain how long and how severely the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact Bitdeer.\nSignificant uncertainties associated with the coronavirus remain, including with respect to the availability\nand efficacy of vaccines, the duration of the pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of COVID-19, and\nactions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the coronavirus or to treat its impact. The\nfull impact of the coronavirus is unknown at this time. If the pandemic continues and lasts for a prolonged\nperiod in the regions where Bitdeer operates, such as cases resurgence in certain areas, the economy could\nsuffer substantially from the measures and restrictions taken to combat the virus, which would, in turn, have\nan adverse impact on Bitdeer\u2019s business prospects. Any significant disruption resulting from this or similar\nepidemics on a large scale or over a prolonged period of time could significantly interrupt Bitdeer\u2019s business\nuntil it would be able to resume normal business operations, which will negatively affect Bitdeer\u2019s financial\ncondition. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations, it may also heighten some of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to Cryptocurrencies\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the\ndeterminations that Bitdeer has made for how to account for cryptocurrencies transactions may be subject to\nchange.\nThe accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to\ninterpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cIASB\u201d), the SEC, and various bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Further, there\nhas been limited precedents for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related valuation and\nrevenue recognition, and no official guidance has been provided by the IASB or the SEC. As such, there\nremains significant uncertainty on how companies can account for cryptocurrency transactions,\ncryptocurrencies, and related revenue. Uncertainties in or changes to in regulatory or financial accounting\nstandards could result in the need to changing our accounting methods and restate our financial statements\nand impair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could adversely affect our\nfinancial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and more generally impact our business,\noperating results, and financial condition.\nAny loss or destruction of a private key required to access a cryptocurrency of Bitdeer\u2019s is irreversible. Bitdeer also\nmay temporarily lose access to its cryptocurrencies.\nCryptocurrencies are each accessible and controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public\nkey and private key associated with the cryptocurrency, wherein the public and private keys are held in an\noffline or online digital wallet. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no\nbackup of the private key is available, Bitdeer will be unable to access the applicable cryptocurrency\nassociated with that private key and the private key cannot be restored. As a result, any cryptocurrencies\nassociated with such key could be irretrievably lost. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used\nto store the applicable cryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn addition, Bitdeer may temporarily lose access to its cryptocurrencies as a result of software or\nsystems upgrades or maintenance. In this case, Bitdeer would likely rely on third parties to assist in restoring\nits access, and there is no assurance such third parties will be able to restore access on a timely basis, or at\nall. Any temporary loss, if it occurs, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n64 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBitcoin exchanges and wallets, and to a lesser extent, the Bitcoin network itself, may suffer from hacking and fraud\nrisks, which may adversely erode user confidence in Bitcoin which would decrease the demand for Bitdeer\u2019s\nproducts and services. Further, digital asset exchanges on which crypto assets trade are relatively new and largely\nunregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Incorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may\nbe irreversible.\nBitcoin transactions are entirely digital and, as with any virtual system, are at risk from hackers, malware\nand operational glitches. Hackers can target Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin transactions, to gain access to\nthousands of accounts and digital wallets where Bitcoins are stored. Bitcoin transactions and accounts are\nnot insured by any type of government program and all Bitcoin transactions are permanent because there is\nno third party or payment processor. Bitcoin has suffered from hacking and cyber-theft as such incidents\nhave been reported by several cryptocurrency exchanges and miners, highlighting concerns about the\nsecurity of Bitcoin and therefore affecting its demand and price.\nTo the extent that cryptocurrency exchanges or other trading venues are involved in fraud or experience\nsecurity failures or other operational issues, a reduction in cryptocurrency prices could occur.\nCryptocurrency market prices depend, directly or indirectly, on the prices set on exchanges and other trading\nvenues, which are new and, in most cases, largely unregulated as compared to established, regulated\nexchanges for securities, derivatives and other currencies. For example, during the past three years, a number\nof Bitcoin exchanges have been closed due to fraud, business failure or security breaches. In many of these\ninstances, the customers of the closed Bitcoin exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the\npartial or complete losses of their account balances in such Bitcoin exchanges. Also, the price and exchange\nof Bitcoin may be affected due to fraud risk. While Bitcoin uses private key encryption to verify owners and\nregister transactions, fraudsters and scammers may attempt to sell false Bitcoins. All of the above may\nadversely affect the operation of the Bitcoin network which would erode user confidence in Bitcoin, which\nwould negatively affect demand for Bitdeer\u2019s products and services. In addition, smaller exchanges are less\nlikely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that provide larger exchanges with additional stability,\nlarger exchanges may be more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and \u201cmalware\u201d  (i.e., software used or\nprogrammed by attackers to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to\nprivate computer systems) and may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action.\nFor example, during the past three years, a number of Bitcoin exchanges have been closed due to fraud,\nbusiness failure or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of the closed Bitcoin\nexchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances\nin such Bitcoin exchanges. While smaller exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and\ncapitalization that provide larger exchanges with additional stability, larger exchanges may be more likely to\nbe appealing targets for hackers and \u201cmalware\u201d  (i.e., software used or programmed by attackers to disrupt\ncomputer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems) and may be\nmore likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action.\nFurther, digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases,\nlargely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding\ntheir ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the\nmarketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges,\nincluding prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. During\n2022, a number of companies in the crypto industry have declared bankruptcy, including Compute North,\nCore Scientific, Alameda Research LLC, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows, BlockFi, and FTX.\nIn June 2022, Celsius began pausing all withdrawals and transfers between accounts on its platform, and in\nJuly 2022, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Further, in November 2022, FTX, one of the major\ncryptocurrency exchanges, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Such bankruptcies have contributed, at least\nin part, to further price decreases in Bitcoin, a loss of confidence in the participants of the digital asset\necosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly, and other participants and\nentities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected. These events\nhave also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital assets markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX\nengaged in significant trading activity.\nBitdeer has not been directly impacted by any of the recent bankruptcies in the crypto asset space, as it\nhas no contractual privity or relationship to the relevant parties. However, Bitdeer is dependent on the\noverall\n65 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncrypto assets industry, and such recent events have contributed, at least in part, to its peers\u2019 stock price as\nwell as the price of Bitcoin. If the liquidity of the digital assets markets continues to be negatively impacted,\ndigital asset prices (including the price of Bitcoin) may continue to experience significant volatility and\nconfidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. A perceived lack of stability in the digital\nasset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business\nfailure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital\nasset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a\ndigital asset exchange\u2019s failure could adversely affect an investment in Bitdeer, discourage overall\nparticipation in the cryptocurrency industry, and result in loss of customer demand for Bitdeer\u2019s products\nand services. Cryptocurrency investments may be subject to losses or impairments if cryptocurrency values\ndecrease as a result of failure of any digital asset exchange, however, Bitdeer does not anticipate to actively\nparticipate in such activities in the foreseeable future.\nBitdeer may not have adequate sources of recovery if the cryptocurrencies held by it are lost, stolen or destroyed due\nto third-party cryptocurrencies custodial services or if Bitdeer cannot redeem or withdraw its cryptocurrencies\ninvested in crypto lending or investing activities. Such incidents could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies were held in custody by Matrix Finance and Technologies\nHolding Group and its subsidiaries (\u201cMatrixport Group\u201d), a related party, and Bitdeer\u2019s disposal of\ncryptocurrencies, at spot price on the date of disposal, was primarily to Matrixport Group. For more details\non Bitdeer\u2019s custody agreements with Matrixport Group, see the section entitled \u201cInformation Related to\nBitdeer\u202f-\u202fOur Cryptocurrencies\u202f-\u202fOur Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices\u202f-\u202fAgreements Related\nto Our Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices.\u201d Bitdeer believes that the security procedures that\nMatrixport Group utilizes, such as issuing username, password and hardware tokens, are reasonably\ndesigned to safeguard its Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from theft, loss, destruction or other issues\nrelating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the\nprevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by Bitdeer.\nIf such cryptocurrencies are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a third party liable to\nBitdeer, it is possible that Matrixport Group may not have the financial resources or insurance sufficient to\nsatisfy any or all of Bitdeer\u2019s claims against the third party, or have the ability to retrieve, restore or replace\nthe lost, stolen or destroyed cryptocurrencies due to governing network protocols and the strength of the\ncryptographic systems associated with such cryptocurrencies. To the extent that Bitdeer is unable to recover\non any of its claims against any such third party, such loss could have a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf such services are commercially available, we will consider adding regulated banks, rather than solely\nrelying on crypto custodian, as the custodian for a material amount of our cryptocurrencies. Obtaining\ncryptocurrency custody services from a regulated bank may confer benefits such as improved security and\nreduced fraud. Nevertheless, until now, banks have generally declined to provide custody services for\ncryptocurrencies and other virtual assets, due to the absence of clarity on permissibility and on regulators\u2019\nviews of these activities generally. On July 22, 2020, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nreleased publicly an interpretive letter confirming the authority of a national bank to provide cryptocurrency\ncustody services for customers, providing that a national bank engaging in such activities should develop\nand implement those activities consistent with sound risk management practices and align them with the\nbank\u2019s overall business plans and strategies as set forth in the guidance. On January 27, 2023, the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System released publicly a policy statement to interpret section 9(13) of\nthe Federal Reserve Act, clarifying that the state member banks are not prohibited under the policy from\nproviding safekeeping services for crypto-assets in a custodial capacity, if such activities are conducted in a\nsafe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer, anti-money-laundering, and anti-terrorist-financing\nlaws. However, it will take time for banks to start offering cryptocurrencies custodian services, and before\nthen, we may have to continue to rely on crypto custodians, such as Matrixport Group, for our crypto\ncustodian needs.\nBitdeer has also lent cryptocurrency loans to Matrixport Group and purchased cryptocurrency wealth\nmanagement products from Matrixport Group. See the section entitled \u201cInformation Related to Bitdeer\u202f-\u202fOur\nCryptocurrencies\u201d for more information. Historically, Bitdeer has not incurred or been exposed to any losses\nas a result of its relationship and transactions with Matrixport Group, and has never experienced\n66 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nany excessive redemptions, withdrawals, or a suspension of redemptions or withdrawals, of crypto assets\nfrom Matrixport Group or other exchanges or platforms. Participation in cryptocurrency lending and/or\ninvestment may subject Bitdeer to counterparty risk, which may result in Bitdeer losing part or all of its\ncryptocurrencies lent or invested. To further limit its counterparty risk, Bitdeer does not anticipate to engage\nin crypto lending or investing activities in the foreseeable future.\nAny material transaction between Bitdeer and Matrixport Group or its subsidiaries is subject to\nBitdeer\u2019s related person transaction policy. To the extent Bitdeer fails to appropriately deal with any such\nconflicts of interests, it could negatively impact Bitdeer\u2019s reputation, the ability to raise additional funds and\nthe willingness of counterparties to do business with Bitdeer, all of which could have adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe \u201chalving\u201d of rewards available on the Bitcoin network, or the reduction of rewards on other networks, has had\nand in the future could have a negative impact on Bitdeer\u2019s ability to generate revenue as its customers may not\nhave an adequate incentive to continue transaction processing and customers may cease transaction processing\noperations altogether, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nUnder the current protocols governing the Bitcoin network, the reward for validating a new block on\nthat network is cut in half from time to time, which has been referred to in Bitdeer\u2019s industry as the \u201chalving.\u201d\nWhen the Bitcoin network was first launched, the reward for validating a new block was 50 Bitcoin. In\nNovember 2012, the reward for validating a new block was reduced to 25 Bitcoin. In July 2016, the reward for\nvalidating a new block was reduced to 12.5 Bitcoin, and in May 2020, the reward was further reduced to 6.25\nBitcoin. The next halving for Bitcoin is expected in 2024 at block 840,000, when the reward will reduce to\n3.125. In addition, other networks may operate under rules that, or may alter their rules to, limit the\ndistribution of new cryptocurrencies. Bitdeer, and to Bitdeer\u2019s knowledge, its potential hosting customers,\ncurrently rely on these rewards to generate a significant portion of Bitdeer\u2019s total revenue. If the award of\ncryptocurrencies for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, neither Bitdeer nor its\ncustomers may have an adequate incentive to continue transaction processing and may cease transaction\nprocessing operations altogether, which as a result may significantly reduce demand for Bitdeer\u2019s hosting\nservices. As a result, the halving of available rewards on the Bitcoin network, or any reduction of rewards on\nother networks, would have a negative impact on Bitdeer\u2019s revenue and may have a material adverse effect\non Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the reduction of rewards may reduce Bitdeer\u2019s profit margins, which could result in Bitdeer\nselling a substantial portion of its cryptocurrencies, which are subject to high volatility. If Bitdeer is forced\nto sell cryptocurrencies at low prices, it could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nMalicious actors or botnet may obtain control of more than 50% of the processing power on the Bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrency network.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked\nsoftware coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to\nmining on the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency network, it may be able to alter the blockchain on which the\nBitcoin or other cryptocurrency network and most Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency transactions rely by\nconstructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at\nall. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude, or modify the ordering of transactions, though it\ncould not generate new cryptocurrencies or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could\n\u201cdouble-spend\u201d its own cryptocurrencies (i.e., spend the same cryptocurrencies in more than one\ntransaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users\u2019 transactions for so long as it maintained control. To\nthe extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the\ncryptocurrency network, or the cryptocurrency community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious,\nreversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible.\nAlthough there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of the Bitcoin blockchain achieved\nthrough controlling over 50% of the processing power on the network, it is believed that certain mining\npools may have exceeded the 50% threshold. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater\nrisk in\n67 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of Bitcoin transactions. To the extent that\nthe cryptocurrency ecosystems, including developers and administrators of mining pools, do not act to\nensure greater decentralization of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency mining processing power, the feasibility of\na malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power on the cryptocurrency network will increase,\nwhich may adversely affect an investment in Bitdeer.\nIf there are significant changes to the method of validating blockchain transactions, such changes could harm\nBitdeer\u2019s proprietary mining business and reduce demand for Bitdeer\u2019s products and services.\nNew cryptocurrency transaction protocols are continuously being deployed, and existing and new\nprotocols are in a state of constant change and development. While certain validation protocols currently\nemploy a PoW consensus algorithm, whereby miners are required to expend significant amounts of electrical\nand computing power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and create\nnew blocks in a blockchain, there may be a shift towards adopting alternative validating protocols. These\nprotocols may include a PoS algorithm, PoC algorithm or any other algorithm based on a protocol other than\nPoW, which may decrease the reliance on computing power as an advantage to validating blocks. Bitdeer\u2019s\nproprietary mining operations, and, to Bitdeer\u2019s knowledge, the operations of Bitdeer\u2019s potential hash rate\nsharing and hosting customers, are currently designed to primarily support a PoW consensus algorithm.\nShould the algorithm shift from a PoW validation method to others, mining would require less energy and\nmay render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower priced\nelectricity, processing, real estate or hosting) less competitive. As a result of Bitdeer\u2019s efforts to optimize and\nimprove the efficiency of its cryptocurrency mining operations, Bitdeer may be exposed to the risk in the\nfuture of losing the benefit of Bitdeer\u2019s capital investments and the competitive advantage Bitdeer hopes to\ngain from this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to protocols other than PoW were to\noccur. If Bitdeer cannot adapt to the new mining protocols quickly enough to keep pace with the market\nchange, any such change to transaction validating protocols could have a material adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in the popularity and use of other blockchain networks other than PoW cryptocurrency networks, may\nadversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business.\nA consensus algorithm is the mechanism through which a blockchain network reach consensus. There\nare several types of consensus algorithms, the most common among which are Proof-of-Work (\u201cPoW\u201d),\nProof-of-Stake (\u201cPoS\u201d), Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (\u201cDPoS\u201d), Proof-of-Space-Time (\u201cPoST\u201d), and Proof-of-\nCapacity (\u201cPoC\u201d). PoW is employed by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, according to which miners\nwith higher computing power have better chances to find a valid solution for the next block. On the contrary,\naccording to PoS, the creator of a new block is chosen in a deterministic way based on his or her stake,\nwhich is the number of coins he or she owns. As validation under PoS does not depend on computing\npower, PoS reduces the need for electricity and mining hardware. DPoS works similarly to PoS except it\ninvolves a voting and delegation mechanism to incentivize users to secure the network with their staked\ncollateral. PoST and PoC are consensus mechanism algorithm used in blockchains that allows for mining\ndevices in the network to use their available storage space and time to decide mining rights and validate\ntransactions. PoST and PoC emerged as some of the many alternative solutions to the problem of high\nenergy consumption in PoW systems and cryptocurrency hoarding in PoS systems.\nCurrently, the original PoW cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin, enjoys a first-to-market advantage over\nother networks such as PoS networks and dominates the cryptocurrency markets as it was introduced by\nSatoshi Nakamoto back in 2009, way earlier than other cryptocurrencies, and since then grew into the most\npopulator cryptocurrency. As of December 31, 2020, the market capitalization of Bitcoin was US$542,633.93\nmillion, accounting for approximately 71% of the total capitalization of the global cryptocurrency market,\naccording to Frost & Sullivan. As of June 30, 2022, the market capitalization of Bitcoin was US$383,245.5\nmillion, accounting for approximately 40% to 45% of the total capitalization of the global cryptocurrency\nmarket, according to Frost & Sullivan. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization and its share of the market\ncapitalization of all cryptocurrencies fluctuate as other cryptocurrencies were introduced to the digital assets\nindustry at a later time and became more mainstream for various reasons, and there is no guarantee that\nBitcoin or other PoW cryptocurrency networks, will continue to enjoy such market leading position and\ncould be is overtaken by another virtual asset. For example, as the cryptocurrency community continues to\ndevelop and advance\n68 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPoS technologies, PoS networks may offer actual or perceived advantages over PoW networks. While\nBitdeer intends to enrich its product and service portfolio by providing mining services covering new crypto\nprotocols, including PoS, DPoS, PoST and PoC, and steadily increase the weight of new business to\ndiversify revenue streams and attract new customers who are users of these new crypto protocols, Bitdeer\u2019s\nservices primarily support PoW protocol currently. Specifically, prior to the second half of 2021, Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness was limited to PoW protocol only\u037e commencing from the second half of 2021, Bitdeer started to\nmine Filecoin, which adopted PoST protocol, on a proprietary basis, and to offer computing power sharing\nsolutions regarding Filecoin mining under its Cloud Hash Rate business. If preferences in the\ncryptocurrency markets shift away from PoW networks and PoS networks achieve widespread adoption, it\ncould attract users away from Bitcoin and the other PoW cryptocurrencies Bitdeer mines and the PoW\nrelated products mining services Bitdeer offers, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness and Bitdeer\u2019s prospects or operations as there is no guarantee that Bitdeer will be able to adapt to\nnew businesses swiftly enough, if at all.\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin network software patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage\nof the users and miners in the Bitcoin network could result in a \u201cfork\u201d in the blockchain, resulting in the operation\nof two separate networks that cannot be merged. The existence of forked blockchains could erode user confidence in\nBitcoin and could adversely impact Bitdeer\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBitcoin is based on open-source software and has no official developer or group of developers that\nformally controls the Bitcoin network. Any individual can download the Bitcoin network software and make\nany desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the Bitcoin network through software\ndownloads and upgrades. However, miners and users must consent to those software modifications by\ndownloading the altered software or upgrading and implementing the changes\u037e otherwise, the changes do\nnot become part of the Bitcoin network. Since the Bitcoin network\u2019s inception, changes to the Bitcoin\nnetwork have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the Bitcoin network\nremains a coherent economic system. However, a developer or group of developers could potentially\npropose a modification to the Bitcoin network that is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users,\nbut that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants in the Bitcoin network. In such a\ncase, a fork in the blockchain could develop and two separate Bitcoin networks could result, one running the\npre-modification software program and the other running the modified version. An example is the\nintroduction of a cryptocurrency known as \u201cBitcoin cash\u201d in mid-2017. This kind of split in the Bitcoin\nnetwork could erode user confidence in the stability of the Bitcoin network, which could negatively affect\nthe demand for Bitdeer\u2019s services.\nCryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and, if stolen or incorrectly transferred, cryptocurrencies may be\nirretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed cryptocurrency transactions could have a material adverse effect\non Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTypically, cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without\nthe consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a\nmajority of the processing power on the applicable network. Once a transaction has been confirmed and\nverified in a block that is added to the network blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency or a\ntheft of a cryptocurrency generally will not be reversible and Bitdeer may not be capable of seeking\ncompensation for any such transfer or theft. Although transfers of any cryptocurrencies Bitdeer holds will\nregularly be made to or from vendors, consultants, services providers, etc., it is possible that, through\ncomputer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies could be transferred\nfrom itself in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that Bitdeer is unable to seek a\ncorrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party that has received\nBitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies through error or theft, Bitdeer will be unable to revert or otherwise recover\nBitdeer\u2019s incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies. To the extent that Bitdeer is unable to seek redress for\nsuch error or theft, such loss could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nThe cryptocurrencies held by Bitdeer may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access, which could have\na material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere is a risk that some or all of the cryptocurrencies held or hosted by Bitdeer could be lost, stolen or\ndestroyed. Bitdeer believes that the cryptocurrencies held or hosted by itself and its mining operation will be\n69 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nan appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal Bitdeer\u2019s\ncryptocurrencies. Bitdeer\u2019s security procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the\nactions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of one of Bitdeer\u2019s employees, or otherwise, and, as a result,\nan unauthorized party may obtain access to Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrency accounts, private keys, data or\ncryptocurrencies. Although Bitdeer implements a number of security procedures with various elements such\nas two-factor verification, segregated accounts and secured facilities and plans to implement the\nmaintenance of data on computers and/or storage media that is not directly connected to, or accessible from,\nthe internet and/or networked with other computers, or \u201ccold storage,\u201d to minimize the risk of loss, damage\nand theft, and Bitdeer updates such security procedures whenever reasonably practicable, there is no\nguarantee that the prevention of such loss, damage or theft, whether caused intentionally, accidentally or by\nan act of God.\nAdditionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce Bitdeer\u2019s employees to disclose\nsensitive information in order to gain access to Bitdeer\u2019s infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain\nunauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed\nto remain dormant until a predetermined event, and often are not recognized until launched against a target,\nBitdeer may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As\ntechnological change occurs, the security threats to Bitdeer\u2019s Bitcoin will likely adapt and previously\nunknown threats may emerge. Bitdeer\u2019s ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs\nor trends may pose a challenge to the safekeeping of Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies. To the extent Bitdeer is\nunable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies may be subject to\ntheft, loss, destruction or other attacks.\nAny of these events could expose Bitdeer to liability, damage its reputation, reduce customer\nconfidence in Bitdeer\u2019s products and services and otherwise have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Bitdeer believes that as its assets grow,\nBitdeer may become a more appealing target for security threats, such as hackers and malware. If an actual or\nperceived breach of Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrency accounts occurs, the market perception of Bitdeer\u2019s\neffectiveness could be harmed.\nThe impact of geopolitical, economic or other events on the supply of and demand for cryptocurrencies is uncertain,\nbut could motivate large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies, which could result in a reduction in the price of such\ncryptocurrencies and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrencies, which are\nrelatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative,\ndecentralized means of buying and selling goods and services. It is unclear how this supply and demand will\nbe impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or economic crises may motivate large-scale\nacquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of cryptocurrencies\nlikely would result in a reduction in the price of the subject cryptocurrency and could have a material\nadverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the price of cryptocurrencies may be affected by the buying and selling of a significant\namount of cryptocurrencies by a holder, or a group of holders. Any unforeseen actions by holders of a\nsignificant amount of cryptocurrencies, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction\nsettlement times and any mechanisms of increasing the scale of cryptocurrency settlement may significantly alter the\ncompetitive dynamics in the market.\nMany cryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction\nsettlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling\ncryptocurrencies, and particularly Bitcoin, is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a\nmeans of payment, which is necessary to the growth and development of Bitdeer\u2019s business.\nMany cryptocurrency networks face significant scaling challenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are\nlimited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. In this respect, Bitcoin may be\nparticularly affected as it relies on the PoW validation, which due to its inherent characteristics may be\n70 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nparticularly hard to scale to allow simultaneous processing of multiple daily transactions by users.\nParticipants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average number\nof transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are\nresearching ways to increase scale, such as \u201csharding,\u201d which is a term for a horizontal partition of data in a\ndatabase or search engine, which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single\nminer\u2019s or validator\u2019s block.\nThere is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of\nsettlement of cryptocurrency transactions will be effective, how long they will take to become effective or\nwhether such mechanisms will be effective for all cryptocurrencies. There is also a risk that any mechanisms\nof increasing the scale of cryptocurrency settlements may significantly alter the competitive dynamics in the\ncryptocurrency market, and may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and the price of Bitdeer\u2019s shares or the\nprice of BTG Ordinary Shares after the completion of the Business Combination, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nTo the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the\npayment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not\nrequire the payment of transaction fees. Any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss\nof confidence in that cryptocurrency network, which could adversely impact an investment in Bitdeer.\nTo the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not\nbe recorded on the blockchain. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the\nrecording of transactions in solved blocks\u037e however, to the extent that any such incentives arise (e.g., a\ncollective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing Bitcoin users to pay transaction fees\nas a substitute for or in addition to the award of new Bitcoins upon the solving of a block), actions of miners\nsolving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the\nblockchain.\nAny systemic delays in the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain could result in\ngreater exposure to double-spending transactions and a loss of confidence in certain or all cryptocurrency\nnetworks, which could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition,\nand operating results.\nNetwork congestion could result in high fees, delayed transactions, and a loss of confidence in that cryptocurrency\nnetwork, which could adversely impact an investment in Bitdeer.\nRising adoption of blockchain networks leads to network congestion, as space on decentralized ledgers\nis inherently scarce. From a design standpoint, striking a balance between security, decentralization, and\nscalability (or transactional throughput) is the subject of great debate among innovators and has led to the\ncreation of a variety of networks that make different trade-offs to achieve different outcomes. If network\ncongestion rises to the point where transaction fees make it prohibitively expensive for average users to\noperate on the network, those users may stop using the network, and application developers may seek to\nbuild on other networks where users can afford to transact.\nIncreasing growth and popularity of cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) and security token\nofferings, as well as non-digital asset-related applications that utilize blockchain technology on certain\nnetworks, can cause congestion and backlog, and as result, increase latency on such networks. An increase\nin congestion and backlogs could result in longer transaction confirmation times, an increase in unconfirmed\ntransactions (that is, transactions that have yet to be included in a block on a network and therefore are not\nyet completed transactions), higher transaction fees and an overall decrease in confidence in a particular\nnetwork, which could ultimately affect Bitdeer\u2019s ability to transact on that particular network and, in turn,\ncould have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer may diversify its business by mining or investing in additional cryptocurrencies which could require\nsignificant investment or expose Bitdeer to trading risks.\nThe field of cryptocurrencies is constantly expanding with around 10,000 types of cryptocurrencies in\nexistence as of December 2021. Bitdeer intends to evaluate the potential for mining or investing in existing,\nnew and alternative cryptocurrencies. To the extent Bitdeer elects to commence activities to generate\n71 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncryptocurrencies, Bitdeer would be required to invest Bitdeer\u2019s assets either to obtain mining equipment\nconfigured to generate cryptocurrencies based on a PoW protocol or to post \u201cstakes\u201d to generate\ncryptocurrencies based on a PoS protocol. In addition, or in the alternative, Bitdeer may trade its\ncryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies on centralized or decentralized exchanges. Optimization of such\ntrades may vary depending on the exchange on which the trade is conducted because Bitdeer may not have\naccess to all exchanges on which such trades are available. Further, trading on centralized and decentralized\nexchanges may expose Bitdeer to additional risks if such exchanges experience breaches of security\nmeasures, system errors or vulnerabilities, software corruption, hacking or other irregularities. Any new\ncryptocurrency obtained through generation or trading may be more volatile or fail to increase in value\ncompared to cryptocurrencies Bitdeer currently holds. As a result, any investment in different\ncryptocurrencies may not achieve Bitdeer\u2019s goals, may be viewed negatively by analysts or investors and\nmay negatively affect Bitdeer\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\nIf the transaction fees for recording cryptocurrencies in a blockchain increase, demand for cryptocurrencies may be\nreduced and prevent the expansion of the networks to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a\nreduction in the acceptance or price of cryptocurrencies.\nAs the number of cryptocurrencies awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive\nfor mining participants to contribute processing power to networks will transition from a set reward to\ntransaction fees. In order to incentivize mining participants to continue to contribute processing power to\nthe networks, the network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a\nblock.\nIf mining participants demand higher transaction fees to record transactions in a blockchain or a\nsoftware upgrade automatically charges fees for all transactions, the cost of using cryptocurrencies may\nincrease and the marketplace may be reluctant to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Existing\nusers may be motivated to switch from one cryptocurrency to another or back to fiat currency. Decreased\nuse and demand for cryptocurrencies may adversely affect their value and result in a reduction in the value\nof Bitdeer\u2019s common stock.\nIf the award of new cryptocurrencies and/or transaction fees for solving blocks is not sufficiently high to incentivize\nminers, such processors may reduce or cease expending processing power on a particular network, which could\nnegatively impact the utility of the network, reduce the value of its cryptocurrencies and have a material adverse\neffect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs the number of cryptocurrencies rewarded to miners for validating blocks in a network decreases, the\nincentive for miners to continue contributing processing power to the network may shift toward transaction\nfees. Such a shift may increase the transaction fees on a network. Higher transaction fees may reduce the\nutility of a network for an end user, which may cause end users to reduce or stop their use of that network. In\nsuch case, the price of the relevant cryptocurrency may decline substantially and could go to zero. Such\nreduced price and demand for, and use of, the relevant cryptocurrency and network, either as it applies to\nBitdeer\u2019s transaction processing services or to those of Bitdeer\u2019s potential hosting customers, may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMiners may sell a substantial number of cryptocurrencies into the market, which may exert downward pressure on\nthe price of the applicable cryptocurrency and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nTransaction processing requires the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of hardware,\nleasing or purchasing space, involves substantial electricity costs and requires the employment of personnel\nto operate the data facilities, which may lead transaction processing operators to liquidate their positions in\ncryptocurrencies to fund these capital requirements. In addition, if the reward of new cryptocurrencies for\ntransaction processing declines, and/or if transaction fees are not sufficiently high, profit margins for\ntransaction processing operators may be reduced, and such operators may be more likely to sell a higher\npercentage of their cryptocurrencies. Whereas it is believed that individual operators in past years were more\nlikely to hold cryptocurrencies for more extended periods, the immediate selling of newly transacted\ncryptocurrencies by operators may increase the supply of such cryptocurrencies on the applicable exchange\n72 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmarket, which could create downward pressure on the price of the cryptocurrencies and, in turn, could have\na material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of cryptocurrency mining operations are not high, mining participants are more\nlikely to sell their earned Bitcoin, which could constrain Bitcoin prices.\nOver the past few years, cryptocurrency mining operations have evolved from individual users mining\nwith computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation application-specific integrated\ncircuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and\nunincorporated \u201cprofessionalized\u201d mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use\nproprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the\ninvestment of significant capital to acquire this hardware, to lease operating space (often in datacenters or\nwarehousing facilities), and to pay the costs of electricity and labor to operate the mining datacenters. As a\nresult, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior mining operations and have more\ndefined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized\nmining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of cryptocurrencies. To the extent the price of\ncryptocurrencies declines and such profit margin is constrained, professionalized mining participants are\nincentivized to more immediately sell cryptocurrencies earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed\nthat individual mining participants in past years were more likely to hold newly mined cryptocurrencies for\nmore extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined cryptocurrencies greatly increases the trading\nvolume of the cryptocurrencies, creating downward pressure on the market price of cryptocurrency rewards.\nThe extent to which the value of cryptocurrencies mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the\nallocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized\nmining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined cryptocurrencies rapidly if\nit is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is\nnegative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby\npotentially depressing cryptocurrency prices. Lower cryptocurrency prices could result in further tightening\nof profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the\nprice of cryptocurrencies until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing\nthem to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily. Such circumstances could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of Bitcoin\nand any other cryptocurrencies Bitdeer mines or otherwise acquire or hold for Bitdeer\u2019s own account.\nCryptocurrencies and transactions may be subject to further taxation in the future.\nIn recent years, the rise of cryptocurrency prices and transaction volume has attracted the attention of\ntax authorities. As the laws governing cryptocurrencies are still evolving, the tax treatment of\ncryptocurrencies in various jurisdictions is subject to change. New laws or legislations, such as the ones\nintroduced in the United States under the \u201cInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,\u201d commonly referred to as\nthe \u201cinfrastructure bill,\u201d which was signed into law on November 15, 2021, will include tax reporting\nprovisions that apply to cryptocurrencies. Introductions of more stringent provisions on reporting or\nsurveillance of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrencies will likely be an ongoing trend from authorities\nworldwide. Bitdeer cautions that these new provisions may direct or indirectly impact scrutiny and\nassessments in relation to taxation. While some countries have expressed an intention to or have imposed\ntaxation on cryptocurrencies and transactions, other tax authorities have been silent. As there is\nconsiderable uncertainty over the taxation of cryptocurrencies, there is no guarantee that the\ncryptocurrencies and transactions denominated in cryptocurrencies will not be subject to further taxation in\nthe future, including but not limited to additional taxes and increased tax rate. These events could reduce the\neconomic return of cryptocurrency and increase the holding costs of cryptocurrencies, rendering the\ncryptocurrency mining solutions Bitdeer provides less attractive to customers, which could materially and\nadversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Other Legal Matters\nBitdeer is subject to a highly-evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or its failure to comply\nwith, any laws and regulations could adversely affect its business, reputation, prospects or operations.\nUntil recently, relatively little regulatory attention has been directed toward the crypto assets market by\nU.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments and self-regulatory agencies. As crypto assets\nhave\n73 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ngrown in popularity and in market size, the U.S. regulatory regime\u202f-\u202fnamely the Federal Reserve Board, U.S.\nCongress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the\n\u201cCFTC\u201d), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the \u201cFinCEN\u201d) and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation), and local and foreign governmental organizations, consumer agencies and public advocacy\ngroups have been examining the operations of crypto networks, users and platforms, with a focus on how\ncrypto assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities, fund criminal or terrorist enterprises,\nand the safety and soundness of platforms and other service providers that hold crypto assets for users.\nMany of these entities have called for heightened regulatory oversight, and have issued consumer\nadvisories describing the risks posed by crypto assets to users and investors. For instance, in March 2022,\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed the need for regulation to prevent \u201ccryptocurrencies from\nserving as a vehicle for terrorist finance and just general criminal behavior\u201d. On March 8, 2022, President\nBiden announced an executive order on cryptocurrencies which seeks to establish a unified federal\nregulatory regime for cryptocurrencies. The complexity and evolving nature of Bitdeer\u2019s business and the\nsignificant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the crypto assets industry requires Bitdeer to exercise\nits judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to it, and it is possible that\ngovernmental bodies and regulators may disagree with its conclusions. To the extent Bitdeer has not\ncomplied with such laws, rules and regulations, Bitdeer could be subject to significant fines, revocation of\nlicenses, limitations on its products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences,\neach of which may be significant and could adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial\ncondition.\nAdditionally, the recent bankruptcy filings of FTX, the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at\nthe time of its filing, and its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC, in addition to other bankruptcy\nfilings of crypto companies throughout calendar year 2022, will likely attract heightened regulatory scrutiny\nfrom U.S. regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Increasing regulation and regulatory scrutiny may\nresult in additional costs for Bitdeer and Bitdeer\u2019s management having to devote increased time and\nattention to regulatory matters, change aspects of Bitdeer\u2019s business or result in limits on the utility of\nBitcoin. In addition, regulatory developments and/or Bitdeer\u2019s business activities may require Bitdeer to\ncomply with certain regulatory regimes. Increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements and any\nregulatory investigations and enforcement may result in changes to Bitdeer\u2019s business, as well as increased\ncosts, supervision and examination. Moreover, new laws, regulations, or interpretations may result in\nadditional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions. Adverse changes to, or\nBitdeer\u2019s failure to comply with, any laws and regulations may have, an adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nreputation and brand and its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAlthough Bitdeer is not directly connected to the recent cryptocurrency market events, Bitdeer may still\nsuffer reputational harm due to its association with the cryptocurrency industry in light of the recent\ndisruption in the crypto asset markets. Ongoing and future regulation and regulatory actions could\nsignificantly restrict or eliminate the market for or uses of Bitcoin and/or may adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of Bitdeer\u2019s business requires the application of complex financial accounting rules, and there is limited\nguidance from accounting standard setting bodies. If financial accounting standards undergo significant changes,\nBitdeer\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe accounting rules and regulations that Bitdeer must comply with are complex and subject to\ninterpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cIASB\u201d), the SEC, and various bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on Bitdeer\u2019s reported financial results, and may even affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Recent actions\nand public comments from the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls.\nIn addition, many companies\u2019 accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and\nthe public. Further, there has been limited precedents for the financial accounting of cryptocurrency-related\ntransactions. As such, there remains significant uncertainty on how companies can account for crypto\nassets transactions, crypto assets, and related revenue. Uncertainties in or changes to regulatory or financial\naccounting standards could result in the need to change Bitdeer\u2019s accounting methods and restate its\nfinancial statements and impair its ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could\nadversely\n74 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naffect the accuracy of its financial statements, result in a loss of investor confidence, and more generally\nimpact its business, operating result, and financial condition.\nBitdeer is subject to tax risks related to Bitdeer\u2019s multinational operations.\nBitdeer is subject to taxes in various overseas jurisdictions where Bitdeer operates. Tax laws and\npractices applicable in the various jurisdictions Bitdeer operates in are complex and sophisticated, and\nBitdeer faces risks of tax incompliance caused by misunderstanding of regional tax policies or different tax\nadministration enforcement. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may\nbe subject to significant changes. Bitdeer\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nBitdeer is also subject to the examination of tax returns and other tax matters by domestic and\ninternational tax authorities and governmental bodies. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these\nexaminations. If Bitdeer\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of Bitdeer\u2019s\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, Bitdeer\u2019s financial condition,\noperating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nBitdeer\u2019s interactions with a blockchain may expose it to SDN or blocked persons or cause Bitdeer to violate\nprovisions of law that did not contemplate distribute ledger technology.\nThe OFAC requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons\nnamed on its specially designated nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of\nblockchain transactions, Bitdeer may, inadvertently and without its knowledge, engage in transactions with\npersons named on OFAC\u2019s SDN list. Bitdeer\u2019s internal policies prohibit any transactions with such SDN\nindividuals, but it may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with\nwhom it transacts with respect to Bitdeer cryptocurrency mining-related products and services. In addition,\nin the future, OFAC or another regulator, may require Bitdeer to screen transactions for OFAC addresses or\nother bad actors before including such transactions in a block, which may increase Bitdeer\u2019s compliance\ncosts, decrease Bitdeer\u2019s anticipated transaction fees and lead to decreased traffic on Bitdeer\u2019s network. Any\nof these factors, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nMoreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual\ndepiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have\nembedded such depictions on one or more blockchains. Because Bitdeer\u2019s business requires it to download\nand retain one or more blockchains to effectuate Bitdeer\u2019s ongoing business, it is possible that such digital\nledgers contain prohibited depictions without Bitdeer\u2019s knowledge or consent. To the extent government\nenforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by\ndecentralized distributed ledger technology, Bitdeer may be subject to investigation, administrative or court\nproceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm Bitdeer\u2019s reputation\nand could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nBitdeer\u2019s mining datacenters may be located on property whose owner has not obtained the approval of relevant\nauthorities, and it may be ordered to relocate from that property.\nBitdeer\u2019s mining datacenters where mining machines operate are located in different places around the\nworld. Due to the unexpectable regulations that the governments may impose on the development of\ncryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency mining, the properties Bitdeer is renting currently may not be in\naccordance with local zoning ordinance. Such mining datacenters may be considered to be in violation of\nrelevant zoning laws and the government may order the demolition or relocation of such datacenters. If\nBitdeer is evicted from such property, it may need to find alternative properties and relocate Bitdeer\u2019s mining\ndatacenters. Unless Bitdeer is able to make timely alternative arrangements for relocating, it may not be able\nto fulfill purchase orders received, which may have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n75 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBitdeer may be involved in legal and other disputes from time to time arising out of Bitdeer\u2019s operations, including\ndisputes with Bitdeer\u2019s suppliers, business partners, customers or employees.\nBitdeer may from time to time be involved in disputes with various parties arising out of Bitdeer\u2019s\noperations, including mining machines or electricity suppliers, business partners, customers or employees.\nThese disputes may lead to protests or legal or other proceedings and may result in damage to Bitdeer\u2019s\nreputation, substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from Bitdeer\u2019s core\nbusiness activities. In addition, Bitdeer may encounter compliance issues with regulatory bodies in the\ncourse of Bitdeer\u2019s operations, in respect of which Bitdeer may face administrative proceedings or\nunfavorable rulings that may result in liabilities and cause delays or disruptions to Bitdeer\u2019s services. Bitdeer\nmay be involved in other proceedings or disputes in the future that may have a material adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nBitdeer may increasingly become a target for public scrutiny, including complaints to regulatory agencies, negative\nmedia coverage, and malicious allegations, all of which could severely damage Bitdeer\u2019s reputation and materially\nand adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business and prospects.\nCertain features of cryptocurrency networks, such as decentralization, independence from sovereignty\nand anonymity of transactions, create the possibility of heightened attention from the public, regulators and\nthe media. Heightened regulatory and public concerns over cryptocurrency-related issues may subject\nBitdeer to additional legal and social responsibilities and increased scrutiny and negative publicity over\nthese issues and even boycott by the rest of the mining community, due to Bitdeer\u2019s leading position in the\ncryptocurrency mining industry. From time to time, these allegations, regardless of their veracity, may result\nin consumer dissatisfaction, public protests or negative publicity, which could result in government inquiry\nor substantial harm to Bitdeer\u2019s brand, reputation and operations. Moreover, as Bitdeer\u2019s business expands\nand grows, Bitdeer may be exposed to heightened public scrutiny in jurisdictions where Bitdeer already\noperates as well as in new jurisdictions where Bitdeer may operate. There is no assurance that Bitdeer would\nnot become a target for regulatory or public scrutiny in the future or that scrutiny and public exposure would\nnot severely damage Bitdeer\u2019s reputation as well as Bitdeer\u2019s business and prospects.\nBitdeer\u2019s insurance coverage is limited and may not be adequate to cover potential losses and liabilities. A\nsignificant uninsured loss or a loss in excess of Bitdeer\u2019s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on\nBitdeer\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks associated with Bitdeer\u2019s business and operations include, but are not limited to, business\ninterruption due to regulatory changes, power shortages or network failure, product liability claims and\nlosses of key personnel, any of which may result in significant costs or business disruption. In line with\ngeneral market practice, Bitdeer does not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover\nBitdeer\u2019s operations. However, Bitdeer\u2019s current insurance policies may be insufficient in the event of a\nprolonged or catastrophic event. The occurrence of any such event that is not entirely covered by Bitdeer\u2019s\ninsurance policies may result in interruption of Bitdeer\u2019s operations, subject Bitdeer to significant losses or\nliabilities and damage Bitdeer\u2019s reputation as a provider of business continuity services. In addition, the\nproperty, transit and director and officer insurance policies Bitdeer has obtained may not cover all risks\nassociated with Bitdeer\u2019s business. It may not be possible, either because of a lack of available policies,\nlimits on coverage or prohibitive cost, for Bitdeer to obtain insurance of any type that would cover losses\nassociated with Bitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrency portfolio. The occurrence of certain incidents including severe\nweather, earthquake, fire, war, power outages, flooding and the consequences resulting from them may not\nbe covered by Bitdeer\u2019s insurance policies adequately, or at all. If Bitdeer were subject to substantial\nliabilities that were not covered by its insurance, Bitdeer could incur costs and losses that could materially\nand adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cryptocurrencies held by Bitdeer are not insured. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to\nBitdeer\u2019s cryptocurrencies which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages\nwhich could adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s operations and, consequently, an investment in Bitdeer.\nBitcoin mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of mining machines and\nhave a negative environmental impact.\nBitcoin mining activities are inherently energy-intensive and electricity costs account for a significant\nportion of the overall mining costs. The availability and cost of electricity will restrict the geographic\nlocations\n76 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in electricity cost in a jurisdiction may\nnegatively impact the viability and the expected economic return for Bitcoin mining activities in that\njurisdiction, which may in turn decrease the sales of Bitdeer\u2019s Bitcoin mining machines in that jurisdiction.\nIn addition, the significant consumption of electricity may have a negative environmental impact,\nincluding contribution to climate change, which may give rise to public opinion against allowing the use of\nelectricity for Bitcoin mining activities or government measures restricting or prohibiting the use of\nelectricity for Bitcoin mining activities. Any such development in the jurisdictions where Bitdeer sells its\ncryptocurrency mining-related products and services could have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business operation and international expansion are subject to geopolitical risks.\nBitdeer\u2019s business operation and international expansion are subject to geopolitical risks. Any\nsignificant deterioration in Bitdeer\u2019s business collaboration with Bitdeer\u2019s partners may have a negative\nimpact on the ability of Bitdeer\u2019s business partners to produce or deliver the equipment or components\nBitdeer needs, which could have a material and adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition, there might be significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs,\nincluding trade policies and tariffs regarding the Europe Union or other major economy entities. Countries\nmay respond by imposing retaliatory trade measures against the United States. For details about\ninternational trade relations, see the section entitled \u201c- Risks Related to Bitdeer\u2019s Business, Operations,\nIndustry and Financial Condition\u202f-\u202fChanges in international trade policies and international barriers to trade\nmay have an adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business and expansion plans\u201d in this section. Variations in the\ntrade policies among different countries will significantly influence Bitdeer\u2019s worldwide business and\nregional business relationship, which will materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s business operation and international expansion may have an intrinsic need for governmental interactions,\nand are therefore subject to higher corruption risks.\nBitdeer requires significant power resources and related infrastructures to support cryptocurrency\nmining, and that Bitdeer\u2019s business operates under a fast-changing regulatory landscape, both in terms of\ncryptocurrency and environmental regulations. Such business nature may pose an intrinsic need for Bitdeer\nto frequently interact with government authorities by, for example, accessing natural resources and engaging\nin lobbying activities with respect to any relevant regulatory changes. Frequent governmental interactions\nmay pose higher corruption and bribery risks to Bitdeer. In addition, Bitdeer\u2019s plan to expand internationally,\nincluding into jurisdictions which are considered high-risk from an anti-bribery and anti-corruption\nperspective, also heightens the corruption risks for Bitdeer.\nBitdeer requires certain approvals, licenses, permits and certifications to operate. Any failure to obtain or renew any\nof these approvals, licenses, permits or certifications could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business and\nresults of operations.\nIn accordance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bitdeer operates, Bitdeer is\nrequired to maintain certain approvals, licenses, permits and certifications, such as obtaining certificates of\noccupancy and passing electrical inspection for Bitdeer\u2019s mining datacenters. Complying with such laws and\nregulations may require substantial expense, and any non-compliance may expose Bitdeer to liability. In the\nevent of non-compliance, Bitdeer may have to incur significant expenses and divert substantial management\ntime to rectify the incidents. In the future, if Bitdeer fails to obtain all the necessary approvals, licenses,\npermits and certifications, it may be subject to fines or the suspension of operations of the production\nfacilities and research and development facilities that do not have all the requisite approvals, licenses,\npermits and certifications, which could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business and results of\noperations. Bitdeer may also experience adverse publicity arising from non-compliance with government\nregulations, which would negatively impact Bitdeer\u2019s reputation.\nThere is no assurance that Bitdeer will be able to fulfill all the conditions necessary to obtain the\nrequired government approvals, or that relevant government officials will always, if ever, exercise their\ndiscretion in\n77 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBitdeer\u2019s favor, or that Bitdeer will be able to adapt to any new laws, regulations and policies. There may also\nbe delays on the part of government authorities in reviewing Bitdeer\u2019s applications and granting approvals,\nwhether due to the lack of human resources or the imposition of new rules, regulations, government policies\nor their implementation, interpretation and enforcement. If Bitdeer is unable to obtain, or experiences material\ndelays in obtaining, necessary government approvals, Bitdeer\u2019s operations may be substantially disrupted,\nwhich could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer is not aware of any governmental licenses or authorizations required to offer its products and\nservices to customers in the jurisdictions it offers such products and services. However, Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate\nsharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdictions under certain circumstances. See the section entitled \u201c-\nBitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction if Bitdeer is not able to avoid\noffering or selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers. Additionally, Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing\nbusiness may be deemed as securities offerings in other jurisdictions where it is offered.\u201d\nBitdeer may be subject to fines and other administrative penalties resulting from the operation of Bitdeer\u2019s business,\nwhich could materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nBitdeer is a leading cryptocurrency mining service provider with a strong global presence. As of June\n30, 2022, it operates five prime mining datacenters in the United States and Norway and served users across\nover 100 countries and regions around the globe, and may continue to expand Bitdeer\u2019s operations to more\ncountries and regions. Bitdeer is subject to regulation by the multiple government authorities in countries or\nregions where it has presence, and various jurisdictions may from time to time adopt laws, regulations or\ndirectives that affect Bitdeer\u2019s businesses. Moreover, the relevant regulatory authorities possess significant\npowers to enforce applicable regulatory requirements in the event of Bitdeer\u2019s non-compliance, including the\nimposition of fines, sanctions or the revocation of licenses or permits to operate Bitdeer\u2019s business. Bitdeer\nis subject to regulatory risks with regards to mining, holding, using, or transferring cryptocurrencies, etc.,\nand the uncertainty of the regulatory environment and Bitdeer\u2019s ability to anticipate and respond to potential\nchanges in government policies and regulations will have a significant impact on Bitdeer\u2019s business\noperations in countries it operates in and Bitdeer\u2019s overall results of operations. Regulations have impacted\nor could impact, among others, the nature of and scope of offerings Bitdeer is able to make available, the\npricing of offerings on Bitdeer\u2019s platform, Bitdeer\u2019s relationship with, and incentives, fees and commissions\nprovided to or charged from Bitdeer\u2019s business partners, Bitdeer\u2019s ability to operate in certain segments of\nBitdeer\u2019s business. Bitdeer expects that its ability to manage its relationships with regulators in each of its\nmarkets, as well as existing and evolving regulations will continue to impact its results in the future. Any\nmisunderstanding or misinterpretation of the law and regulation could subject Bitdeer to, among others, the\nnon-compliance investigation by the government authorities. There is no guarantee that Bitdeer will not face\nadministrative fines or penalties concerning its operations or its subsidiaries, which could have a material\nadverse impact on its results of operation.\nIf counterfeit products and services are provided under Bitdeer\u2019s brand names and trademarks, Bitdeer\u2019s reputation\nand financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThird-party service providers and dealers are separately responsible for sourcing counterfeit services\nthat are performed under Bitdeer\u2019s brand names and trademarks. Counterfeit services may be dissatisfying or\ninferior in quality as compared to authentic services. If Bitdeer\u2019s customers are not satisfied by counterfeit\nservices provided under Bitdeer\u2019s brand names and trademarks, Bitdeer may be subject to reputational\ndamage. Bitdeer believes its brand and reputation are important to its success and competitive position. The\ndiscovery of counterfeit services provided under Bitdeer\u2019s brand names and trademarks may severally\ndamage Bitdeer\u2019s reputation and cause customers to refrain from making future purchases from it, which\nwould materially and adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business operations and financial results.\nBitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction if Bitdeer is not able to avoid offering or\nselling its hash rate products to U.S. customers. Additionally, Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing business may be deemed as\nsecurities offerings in other jurisdictions where it is offered.\nTo the extent that Bitdeer is appropriately restricting U.S. persons from obtaining its hash rate products,\nsuch business should not be subject to U.S. securities laws. However, whether Bitdeer is effective in\navoiding\n78 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nU.S. jurisdiction by actually not offering or selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers would depend\non, among others, the existence and effectiveness of measures adopted in practice against U.S. persons\nobtaining Bitdeer\u2019s services, such as screening mechanisms and/or contractual restrictions over transfers of\nthe contracts to U.S. persons in the secondary market. See the section entitled \u201cInformation Related to\nBitdeer\u202f-\u202fOur Business Lines and Software Infrastructure\u202f-\u202fMeasures to prevent unauthorized or\nimpermissible customer access\u201d for more details. If certain U.S. customers, or customers from other\njurisdictions where Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing may be deemed as securities offerings, end up obtaining\naccess to Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate products, and Bitdeer has not registered the offering of such products, Bitdeer\nmay be deemed in breach of applicable securities laws. Such breach may result in sizable fines, reputational\nharms, restrictions of certain businesses, and materially adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s business operation and\nfinancial conditions.\nIf Bitdeer were deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,\napplicable restrictions could make it impractical for Bitdeer to continue its business as contemplated and could\nhave a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business.\nAn issuer will generally be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if:\nit is an \u201corthodox\u201d investment company because it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or\nproposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities\u037e or\nit is an inadvertent investment company because, absent an applicable exemption, it owns or\nproposes to acquire \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total\nassets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\nBitdeer believes it is not and will not be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or\ntrading in securities, and Bitdeer does not hold itself out as being engaged in those activities. Bitdeer\nintends to hold itself out as a cryptocurrency mining business. Accordingly, Bitdeer does not believe that it\nis an \u201corthodox\u201d investment company as described in the first bullet point above.\nWhile certain cryptocurrencies may be deemed to be securities, Bitdeer does not believe that certain\nother cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin, are securities\u037e therefore, it believes that less than 40% of\nBitdeer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis\nwill comprise cryptocurrencies that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, Bitdeer does not\nbelieve that Bitdeer is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% inadvertent investment\ncompany test as described in the second bullet point above. Although Bitdeer does not believe any of the\ncryptocurrencies it may own, acquire or mine are securities, there is still some regulatory uncertainty on the\nsubject, see \u201c- There is no one unifying principle governing the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies nor\nwhether cryptocurrencies are securities in any particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or\nmore countries may alter the nature of an investment in Bitdeer or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, such\nas cryptocurrencies, in a manner that adversely affects Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects or operations.\u201d If\ncertain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, were to be deemed securities, and consequently, investment\nsecurities by the SEC, Bitdeer could be deemed an inadvertent investment company. Investment company\nregistration is time consuming and would require a restructuring of Bitdeer\u2019s business. Moreover, the\noperation of an investment company is very costly and restrictive, as investment companies are subject to\nsubstantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio\ncomposition, and the Investment Company Act filing requirements. The cost of such compliance would\nresult in Bitdeer incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a\nmaterially adverse impact on its operations.\nBitdeer intends to conduct its operations so that Bitdeer is not required to register as an investment\ncompany under the 1940 Act. Specifically, Bitdeer does not believe that cryptocurrencies, in particular\nBitcoin, are securities. The SEC Staff has not provided guidance with respect to the treatment of these assets\nunder the 1940 Act. To the extent the SEC Staff publishes new guidance with respect to these matters,\nBitdeer may be required to adjust its strategy or assets accordingly. There can be no assurance that Bitdeer\nwill be able to maintain its exclusion from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. In\naddition, as a consequence of its seeking to avoid the need to register under the 1940 Act on an ongoing\nbasis, Bitdeer may be limited in its ability to engage in cryptocurrency mining operations or otherwise make\ncertain investments, and these limitations could result in Bitdeer holding assets it may wish to sell or selling\nassets it may wish to hold, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n79 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf Bitdeer were to be deemed an inadvertent investment company, it may seek to rely on Rule 3a-2 under\nthe 1940 Act, which allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of\n(a) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer\u2019s\ntotal assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (b) the date on which the issuer owns or\nproposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer\u2019s total\nassets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Bitdeer is\nputting in place policies that it expects will work to keep the investment securities held by Bitdeer at less\nthan 40% of its total assets, which may include acquiring assets with Bitdeer\u2019s cash, liquidating Bitdeer\u2019s\ninvestment securities or seeking no-action relief or exemptive relief from the SEC if Bitdeer is unable to\nacquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner. As Rule 3a-2 is\navailable to an issuer no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available\nto Bitdeer, it would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after it ceases being an\ninadvertent investment company. This may limit Bitdeer\u2019s ability to make certain investments or enter into\njoint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on Bitdeer\u2019s earnings. If Bitdeer failed to take\nadequate steps within the one-year grace period for inadvertent investment companies, it would need to\nregister with the SEC as an investment company under the Investment Company Act or cease almost all\nbusiness, and its contracts would become voidable. In any event, Bitdeer does not intend to become an\ninvestment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nFinally, Bitdeer believes it is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the 1940 Act because\nBitdeer is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.\nThe 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations\nof investment companies. Among other things, the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit\ntransactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the\nissuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. Bitdeer intends to continue to\nconduct its operations so that it will not be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act.\nHowever, if anything were to happen that would cause Bitdeer to be deemed to be an investment company\nunder the 1940 Act, requirements imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on Bitdeer\u2019s capital\nstructure, ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees, could make it\nimpractical for Bitdeer to continue its business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and\narrangements between and among Bitdeer and its senior management team and materially and adversely\naffect Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no one unifying principle governing the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies nor whether cryptocurrencies\nare securities in any particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature\nof an investment in Bitdeer or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoins, in a manner that adversely\naffects Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world\nhave reacted differently, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrencies illegal, and others allowing\ntheir use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., cryptocurrencies, such as\nBitcoins, are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory\nrequirements.\nBitcoin is the oldest and most well-known form of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and other forms of\ncryptocurrencies have been the source of much regulatory consternation, resulting in differing definitional\noutcomes without a single unifying statement. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are viewed differently by\ndifferent regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the\nfederal and state levels. For example, the Financial Action Task Force considers a cryptocurrency as\ncurrency or an asset, and the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) considers a cryptocurrency as property and\nnot currency. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to\ntransactions involving virtual currency.\nFurthermore, in the several applications to establish an exchange traded fund (\u201cETF\u201d) of\ncryptocurrency, and in the questions raised by the Staff under the 1940 Act, no clear principles emerge from\nthe regulators as to how they view these issues and how to regulate cryptocurrency under the applicable\nsecurities acts. It has been widely reported that the SEC has recently issued letters and requested various\nETF applications be withdrawn because of concerns over liquidity and valuation and unanswered questions\nabout absence of\n80 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreporting and compliance procedures capable of being implemented under the current state of the markets for\nexchange traded funds. On April 20, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill titled\n\u201cEliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021\u201d  (H.R. 1602). If passed by the Senate and enacted into law, the\nbipartisan bill would create a cryptocurrency working group to evaluate the current legal and regulatory\nframework around cryptocurrencies in the United States and define when the SEC may have jurisdiction over\na particular token or cryptocurrency (i.e., when it is a security) and when the CFTC may have jurisdiction\n(i.e., on derivatives of a cryptocurrency when it is a commodity).\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies under\nthe securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the\n1940 Act, and the Bank Secrecy Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the\nCFTC, the IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, Bitdeer may be required to register\nand comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that Bitdeer decides to\ncontinue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary\nexpense or burdens to Bitdeer. Bitdeer may also decide to cease certain operations and change Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness model. Any disruption of Bitdeer\u2019s operations in response to the changed regulatory\ncircumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to it.\nA determination that any cryptocurrency is a \u201csecurity\u201d may adversely affect the value of such cryptocurrency and\ncould therefore adversely affect Bitdeer's business, prospects or operations.\nDepending on its characteristics, a cryptocurrency may be considered a \u201csecurity\u201d under the federal\nsecurities laws. The test for determining whether a particular cryptocurrency is a \u201csecurity\u201d is complex and\ndifficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Whether a crytocurrency is a security under the\nfederal securities laws depends on whether it is included in the lists of instruments making up the definition\nof \u201csecurity\u201d in the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. Cryptocurrencies as\nsuch do not appear in any of these lists, although each list includes the terms \u201cinvestment contract\u201d and\n\u201cnote,\u201d and the SEC has typically analyzed whether a particular cryptocurrency is a security by reference to\nwhether it meets the tests developed by the federal courts interpreting these terms, known as the Howey and\nReves tests, respectively. For many cryptocurrencies, whether or not the Howey or Reves tests are met is\ndifficult to resolve definitively, and substantial legal arguments can often be made both in favor of and\nagainst a particular digital asset qualifying as a security under one or both of the Howey and Reves tests.\nAdding to the complexity, the SEC staff has indicated that the security status of a particular digital asset can\nchange over time as the relevant facts evolve.\nCurrent and future legislation and SEC-rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including\ninterpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which Bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d by SEC rulemaking or\ninterpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another exemption is available, including\ntransacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies among owners and requiring registration of trading platforms\nas \u201cexchanges.\u201d Accordingly, cryptocurrencies such as Zcash may currently be a security, based on the\nfacts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to be a security under\nthe federal securities laws. Historically, Bitdeer has generated minimum amount of mining yields from Zcash\nand held minimum amount of Zcash. See the section entitled \u201cInformation Related to Bitdeer\u202f-\u202fOur\nCryptocurrencies\u201d for more details. Bitdeer does not intend to hold or generate mining yield from\ncryptocurrencies in violation of the federal securities laws. Accordingly, if Zcash or other cryptocurrencies\ninvolved in Bitdeer\u2019s business is determined by Bitdeer, the SEC or other regulatory authorities to be a\nsecurity under the federal securities laws, it could result in interruption of Bitdeer\u2019s business operations.\nFurthermore, the SEC may determine that certain cryptocurrencies or interests, for example tokens\noffered and sold in ICOs, may constitute securities under the Howey test as stated by the United States\nSupreme Court. As such, ICO offerings would require registration under the Securities Act or an available\nexemption therefrom for offers or sales in the United States to be lawful. Section 5(a) of the Securities Act\nprovides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person,\ndirectly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Section 5(c) of the\nSecurities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration\nstatement has been filed.\n81 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlthough Bitdeer does not intend to be engaged in the offer or sale of securities in the form of ICO offerings,\nand Bitdeer does not believe its planned mining activities would require registration for it to conduct such\nactivities and accumulate cryptocurrencies, the SEC, CFTC, Nasdaq, IRS or other governmental or quasi-\ngovernmental agency or organization may conclude that Bitdeer\u2019s activities involve the offer or sale of\n\u201csecurities,\u201d or ownership of \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d and it may be subject to regulation or registration\nrequirements under various federal laws and related rules. Such regulation or the inability to meet the\nrequirements to continue operations, would have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business and\noperations. Bitdeer may also face similar issues with various state securities regulators who may interpret\nBitdeer\u2019s actions as subjecting it to regulation, or requiring registration, under state securities laws, banking\nlaws, or money transmitter and similar laws, which are also an unsettled area or regulation that exposes\nBitdeer to risks.\nRegulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of cryptocurrencies or the operation of cryptocurrency networks\nin a manner that may require Bitdeer to cease certain or all operations, which could have a material adverse effect\non Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently, there has been a significant amount of regulatory attention directed toward cryptocurrencies,\ncryptocurrency networks and other industry participants by United States federal and state governments,\nforeign governments and self-regulatory agencies. For example, as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have\ngrown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies\n(e.g., FinCEN, the SEC, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the\noperations of the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin users and Bitcoin exchange markets.\nIn addition, local state regulators such as the Texas State Securities Board, the Massachusetts\nSecurities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities,\nthe North Carolina Secretary of State\u2019s Securities Division and the Vermont Department of Financial\nRegulation have initiated actions against, and investigations of, individuals and companies involved in\ncryptocurrencies.\nAlso, in March 2018, the South Carolina Attorney General Office\u2019s Security Division issued a cease-and-\ndesist order against Genesis Mining and Swiss Gold Global, Inc., stating that both companies were to stop\ndoing business in South Carolina and are permanently barred from offering securities in the state in the\nfuture since they offered unregistered securities via cloud mining contracts under the South Carolina\nUniformed Securities Act of 2005, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-1-101, et seq. (the order against Genesis Mining was\nsubsequently withdrawn). Neither Bitdeer nor, to Bitdeer\u2019s knowledge, Matrixport Group, has any direct or\nindirect relationship with these two companies.\nFurther, the North Carolina Secretary of State\u2019s Securities Division issued in March 2018 a Temporary\nCease and Desist Order against Power Mining Pool (made permanent pursuant to a Final Order on April 19,\n2018), ordering it to cease and desist, among other things, offering \u201cmining pool shares,\u201d which were deemed\n\u201csecurities\u201d under N.C. Gen. Stat. 78A-2(11), in North Carolina until they are registered with the North\nCarolina Secretary of State or are offered for sale pursuant to an exemption from registration under the North\nCarolina Securities Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. Chapter 78A.\nAdditionally, Bitdeer relies on third-party mining pool service providers for mining revenue payouts\nfrom Bitdeer\u2019s mining operation, and certain of Bitdeer\u2019s potential hosting customers could be involved in, or\ncould issue, cloud mining contracts or mining pool shares, and any regulatory restrictions on their practices\ncould significantly reduce demand for Bitdeer\u2019s hosting services. Furthermore, it is possible that laws,\nregulations or directives that affect cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency transaction processing or blockchain\nserver hosting may change in a manner that may adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s ability to conduct Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness and operations in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, various foreign jurisdictions either have adopted or may adopt laws, regulations or\ndirectives that affect cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency networks and their users and hosting service\nproviders that fall within such jurisdictions\u2019 regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or directives may\nconflict with those of the United States, may negatively impact the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by users,\nmerchants and service providers outside of the United States and may therefore impede the growth of\ncryptocurrency use. A number of countries, including India, South Korea and Russia, among others,\ncurrently have a more restrictive stance toward cryptocurrencies and, thereby, have reduced the rate of\nexpansion of cryptocurrency use, as well as cryptocurrency transaction processing, in each of those\ncountries.\n82 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGovernments may in the future take regulatory actions that prohibit or severely restrict the right to\nacquire, own, hold, sell, use or trade cryptocurrencies or to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency.\nOwnership of, holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction.\nGovernments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and/or subject cryptocurrency\nmining companies to additional regulation.\nBy extension, similar actions by governments may result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership,\nholding, selling, use or trading in the capital stock of cryptocurrency mining companies, including Bitdeer\u2019s\ncommon stock. Such a restriction could result in Bitdeer liquidating its cryptocurrency inventory at\nunfavorable prices and may adversely affect Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders. The effect of any regulatory change,\neither by federal, state, local or foreign governments or any self-regulatory agencies, on Bitdeer or its\npotential hosting customers is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and may require\nBitdeer or its potential hosting customers to cease certain or all operations and could have a material adverse\neffect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent and future legislation and rulemaking regarding cryptocurrencies may result in extraordinary, non-\nrecurring expenses and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nCurrent and future legislation and rulemaking by the CFTC and SEC or other regulators, including\ninterpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which cryptocurrencies are\ntreated. For example, cryptocurrencies derivatives are not excluded from the definition of \u201ccommodity future\u201d\nby the CFTC. Furthermore, according to the CFTC, cryptocurrencies fall within the definition of a commodity\nunder the Commodities Exchange Act (the \u201cCEA\u201d) and as a result, Bitdeer may be required to register and\ncomply with additional regulations under the CEA, including additional periodic reporting and disclosure\nstandards and requirements. Bitdeer may also be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to\nregister as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. If Bitdeer is required\nto register with the CFTC or another governmental or self-regulatory authority, the scope of Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness and operations may be constrained by the rules of such authority and it may be forced to incur\nadditional expenses in the form of licensing fees, professional fees and other costs of compliance.\nThe SEC has issued guidance and made numerous statements regarding the application of securities\nlaws to cryptocurrencies. For example, on July 25, 2017, the SEC issued a Report of Investigation (the\n\u201cReport\u201d) which concluded that tokens offered and sold by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization\n(\u201cDAO\u201d), a digital decentralized autonomous organization and investor-directed venture capital fund for\ncryptocurrencies, were issued for the purpose of raising funds. The Report concluded that these tokens were\n\u201cinvestment contracts\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the\nExchange Act, and therefore securities subject to the federal securities laws. In December 2017, the SEC\nissued a cease-and-desist letter to Munchee Inc., ordering that the company stop its initial coin offering of\nMUN Tokens on the grounds that it failed to file a registration statement or qualify for an exemption from\nregistration. Similar to the tokens issued by the DAO, the SEC found that the MUN Tokens satisfied the\ndefinition of an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d and were therefore subject to the federal securities laws. In February\n2018, both the SEC and CFTC further reiterated their concerns regarding cryptocurrencies in written\ntestimony to the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. On March 7, 2018, the SEC released\na \u201cStatement on Potentially Unlawful Online Platforms for Trading Digital Assets,\u201d and reiterated that, if a\nplatform \u201coffers trading of cryptocurrencies that are securities\u201d and \u201coperates as \u2018exchange,\u2019 as defined by\nthe federal securities laws,\u201d the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be\nexempt from registration. The SEC\u2019s statement serves as a notice to operators of any platforms, including\nsecondary market trading platforms, which the SEC is actively monitoring for potentially fraudulent or\nmanipulative behavior in the market for security tokens, as the SEC has cautioned recently in the context of\nICOs. On November 16, 2018, the SEC released a \u201cStatement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and\nTrading,\u201d and emphasized that market participants must adhere to the SEC\u2019s well-established and well-\nfunctioning federal securities law framework when dealing with technological innovations, regardless of\nwhether the securities are issued in certificated form or using new technologies, such as blockchain. This\nhas all been followed by additional statements and guidance from the SEC including no-action letters relating\nto specific blockchain-based projects, and a Framework for \u201cInvestment Contract\u201d Analysis of Digital Assets\npublished by the Division of Corporation Finance on April 3, 2019. In an August 2021 interview, SEC\nChairman Gensler signaled the SEC is\n83 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontemplating a robust regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies and reiterated the SEC\u2019s position that many\ncryptocurrencies are unregulated securities.\nThe SEC has been active in asserting its jurisdiction over ICOs and cryptocurrencies and in bringing\nenforcement cases. The SEC has directed enforcement activity toward cryptocurrencies, and more\nenforcement cases. The SEC has directed enforcement activity toward cryptocurrencies, and more\nspecifically, ICOs. In September 2017, the SEC created a new division known as the \u201cCyber Unit\u201d to address,\namong other things, violations involving distributed ledger technology and ICOs, and filed a civil complaint\nin the Eastern District of New York charging a businessman and two companies with defrauding investors in\na pair of so-called ICOs purportedly backed by investments in real estate and diamonds (see Securities and\nExchange Commission v. REcoin Group Foundation, LLC, et al., Civil Action NO. 17-cv- 05725 (E.D.N.Y, filed\nSept. 29, 2017)). Subsequently, the SEC has filed several orders instituting cease-and-desist proceedings\nagainst (i) Carrier EQ, Inc., d/b/a AirFox and Paragon Coin, Inc. in connection with their unregistered\nofferings of tokens (see CarrierEQ, Inc., Rel. No. 33-10575 (Nov. 16, 2018) and Paragon Coin, Inc., Rel. No. 33-\n10574 (Nov. 16, 2018), respectively), (ii) Crypto Asset Management, LP for failing to register a hedge fund\nformed for the purpose of investing in cryptocurrencies as an investment company (see Crypto Asset\nManagement, LP and Timothy Enneking, Rel. No. 33-10544 (Sept. 11, 2018)), (iii) TokenLot LLC for failing to\nregister as a broker-dealer, even though it did not meet the definition of an exchange (see Tokenlot LLC,\nLenny Kugel, and EliL. Lewitt, Rel. No. 33-10543 (Sept. 11, 2018)) and (iv) EtherDelta\u2019s founder for failing\neither to register as a national securities exchange or to operate pursuant to an exemption from registration\nas an exchange after creating a platform that clearly fell within the definition of an exchange (see Zachary\nCoburn, Rel. No. 34- 84553 (Nov. 8, 2018)).\nOn June 4, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork against Kik Interactive, Inc. with respect to its September 2017 offering of Kin. According to articles\npublished by various news outlets, the SEC has allegedly issued numerous subpoenas and information\nrequests to technology companies, advisers and individuals involved in the cryptocurrency space and ICOs,\nas part of a broad inquiry into the cryptocurrency market.\nRecently, a number of proposed ICOs have sought to rely on Regulation A and have filed with the SEC a\nForm 1-A covering a distribution of a digital token. Two such offerings were qualified in July 2019. In\naddition, some token offerings have been commenced as private securities offerings intended to be exempt\nfrom SEC registration. Further, the SEC has yet to approve listing and trading any exchange-traded products\n(such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies. The SEC has taken various actions against persons or entities that\nhave allegedly misused cryptocurrencies, engaged in fraudulent schemes (i.e., Ponzi scheme) and/or\nengaged in the sale of tokens that were deemed securities by the SEC.\nAlthough Bitdeer\u2019s activities are not focused on raising capital or assisting others that do so, the\nfederal securities laws are very broad. Bitdeer cannot provide assurance as to whether the SEC will continue\nor increase its enforcement with respect to cryptocurrencies or ICOs, including taking enforcement action\nagainst any person engaged in the sale of unregistered securities in violation of the Securities Act or any\nperson acting as an unregistered investment company in violation of the Investment Company Act. Because\nthe SEC has held that certain cryptocurrencies are securities based on the current rules and law, Bitdeer may\nbe required to register and comply with the rules and regulations under federal securities laws.\nBitdeer cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of\ncryptocurrencies under the law, including, but not limited to, whether cryptocurrencies will be classified as a\nsecurity, commodity, currency and/or new or other existing classification. Such additional regulations may\nresult in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely affecting investment in\nBitdeer. If Bitdeer determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, it\nmay seek to cease certain or all of Bitdeer\u2019s operations. Any such action could have a material adverse effect\non Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal or state agencies may impose additional regulatory burdens on Bitdeer\u2019s business. Changing laws and\nregulations and changing enforcement policies and priorities have the potential to cause additional expenditures,\nrestrictions, and delays in connection with Bitdeer\u2019s business operations.\nFederal and state laws and regulations may be subject to change or changes in enforcement policies or\npriorities, including changes that may result from changes in the political landscape and changing\ntechnologies.\n84 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFuture legislation and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, or\nchanges in enforcement policies or priorities, could require significant management attention and cause\nadditional expenditures, restrictions, and delays in connection with Bitdeer\u2019s business operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders, customers, government regulators and other\nmarket participants with respect to Bitdeer\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) policies may impose\nadditional costs on Bitdeer or expose Bitdeer to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries and around the globe are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their\nESG policies. Investors, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and\nin recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. In\nFebruary 2021, the Acting Chair of the SEC issued a statement directing the Division of Corporation Finance\nto enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings and in March 2021 the SEC\nannounced the creation of a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement. The increased focus\nand activism related to ESG may hinder Bitdeer\u2019s access to capital, as investors and lenders may reconsider\ntheir capital investment allocation as a result of their assessment of Bitdeer\u2019s ESG practices. If Bitdeer does\nnot adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry shareholder expectations and standards and\npotential government regulations, which are evolving but may relate to the suitable deployment of electric\npower, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues,\nBitdeer\u2019s reputation may suffer which would have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nBitdeer may be subject to risks associated with misleading and/or fraudulent disclosure or use by the creators of\ncryptocurrencies.\nGenerally, Bitdeer relies primarily on a combination of white papers and other disclosure documents\nprepared by the creators of applicable cryptocurrencies, as well as on Bitdeer\u2019s management\u2019s ability to\nobtain adequate information to evaluate the potential implications of transacting in these cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, such white papers and other disclosure documents and information may contain misleading and/or\nfraudulent statements (which may include statements concerning the creators\u2019 ability to deliver in a timely\nfashion the product and/or service disclosed in their white papers and other disclosure documents) and/or\nmay not reveal any unlawful activities by the creators. Recently, there has been an increasing number of\ninvestigations and lawsuits by the SEC and the CFTC involving cryptocurrency creators for fraud and\nmisappropriation, among other charges. Additionally, FinCEN has increased its enforcement efforts involving\ncryptocurrency creators regarding compliance with anti-money laundering and Know-Your-Customer laws.\nTo the extent that any of these creators make misleading and/or fraudulent disclosures or do not comply\nwith federal, state or foreign laws, or if Bitdeer is unable to uncover all material information about these\ncryptocurrencies and/or their creators, Bitdeer may not be able to make a fully informed business decision\nrelating to Bitdeer\u2019s transacting in or otherwise involving such cryptocurrencies, which could have a material\nadverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitdeer\u2019s management and compliance personnel have limited experience handling a listed cryptocurrency mining-\nrelated services company, and Bitdeer\u2019s compliance program has a recent history only.\nBitdeer\u2019s management and compliance personnel have limited experience in handling regulatory and\ncompliance matters relating to a listed cryptocurrency mining-related services company. Bitdeer\u2019s key\ncompliance documents and compliance programs, such as AML and KYC procedures, also have a recent\nhistory only. Bitdeer believes that is has measures designed to limit its counterparty risks. For example,\nBitdeer has been monitoring its investments closely and limiting its exposure to the investment risk by\nincluding in its operation strategy the requirements to invest only in robust wealth management products\nand that the investments need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter. In order to further limit its\nexposure to counterparty risk, Bitdeer adopted an operation strategy in December 2022, pursuant to which\nBitdeer shall not enter into any digital asset based lending or wealth management products in the foreseeable\nfuture. While Bitdeer has been devoting a substantial amount of time and resources to various compliance\ninitiatives and risk management measures, including but not limited to, recruiting a dedicated team of\ncompliance expertise, Bitdeer cannot assure you the practical application and effectiveness of its compliance\nprogram and risk\n85 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmanagement measures, nor that there will not be a failure in detecting regulatory compliance issues or\nmanaging risk exposure, which may adversely affect its reputation, business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nRisks Related to BSGA and the Business Combination\nUnless otherwise stated or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cour\ncompany,\u201d and \u201cBSGA\u201d refer to Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.\nBSGA will be forced to liquidate the Trust Account if it cannot consummate a business combination by the\nCombination Deadline. In the event of a liquidation, BSGA\u2019s public shareholders will receive US$10.87 per share\nand the BSGA Rights will expire worthless.\nIf BSGA is unable to complete a business combination by the Combination Deadline, and is forced to\nliquidate, the per-share liquidation distribution will be US$10.87, without taking into account additional\ndeposits into the Trust Account to further extend the date by which BSGA has to consummate a business\ncombination as allowed pursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles. Furthermore, there will be no distribution\nwith respect to the BSGA Rights, which will expire worthless as a result of BSGA\u2019s failure to complete a\nbusiness combination.\nBSGA\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses\nsubstantial doubt about BSGA\u2019s ability continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2022, BSGA had US$487,303 in cash, and working capital deficit of US$6,602,257.\nFurther, BSGA has incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a public company (for legal,\nfinancial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with its\nproposed initial business combination with Bitdeer. BSGA cannot assure you that any efforts to raise capital\n(if required) or to consummate an initial business combination (including the proposed Business\nCombination with Bitdeer) will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about\nBSGA\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statement contained elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement/\u200bprospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from BSGA\u2019s inability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nMaterial weaknesses in BSGA\u2019s internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on\nBSGA\u2019s business and the price of BSGA\u2019s ordinary shares.\nBSGA has identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. In future periods,\nif additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting are identified, BSGA may be\nrequired to restate its financial statements and could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and\ninvestor confidence, and to litigation from investors and shareholders, which could have a material adverse\neffect on its business and the price of its Class A ordinary shares.\nIn addition, if BSGA does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and\ncontrols, BSGA may not be able to manage its business effectively or accurately report its financial\nperformance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in its ordinary share price and adversely affect its\nresults of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could\npotentially subject BSGA to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities,\nwhich would require additional financial and management resources.\nYou must tender your ordinary shares in order to validly seek redemption at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nIn connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you must elect either to physically tender\nyour share certificates to Continental or to deliver your ordinary shares to Continental electronically using\nDTC\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian) System, in each case at least two business days before the\nExtraordinary General Meeting. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery ensures that a redeeming\nholder\u2019s election to redeem is irrevocable once the Business Combination is consummated. Any failure to\nobserve these procedures will result in your loss of redemption rights in connection with the vote on the\nBusiness Combination.\n86 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf third parties bring claims against BSGA, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share liquidation\nprice received by BSGA Shareholders may be less than US$10.87.\nBSGA\u2019s placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against BSGA.\nAlthough BSGA has received from many of the vendors, service providers (other than its independent\naccountants) and prospective target businesses with which it does business executed agreements waiving\nany right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of\nBSGA\u2019s public shareholders, they may still seek recourse against the Trust Account. Additionally, a court\nmay not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to\nclaims which could take priority over those of BSGA\u2019s public shareholders. If BSGA liquidates the Trust\nAccount before the completion of a business combination and distributes the proceeds held therein to its\npublic shareholders, the Sponsor has contractually agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in\nthe Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities\nthat are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a\nvendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. However, BSGA cannot assure you\nthat they will be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account\nfor our shareholders may be less than US$10.87 due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if BSGA is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed\nagainst it which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable\nbankruptcy law, and may be included in BSGA\u2019s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties\nwith priority over the claims of its shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust\nAccount, BSGA may not be able to return US$10.87 to our public shareholders.\nAny distributions received by BSGA Shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that\nimmediately following the date on which the distribution was made, BSGA was unable to pay its debts as they fell\ndue in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Existing BSGA Articles provides that it will continue in existence only until the date that is 18\nmonths from the closing of the IPO, or December 14, 2022, unless the Initial Shareholders request and the\nBoard approves up to four extensions, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 30 months to\ncomplete a business combination). BSGA has elected to effectuate two extensions, as a result of which the\ndeadline for consummating its initial business combination has been extended to June 14, 2023. If BSGA is\nunable to consummate a transaction within the required time periods set forth under the Existing BSGA\nArticles, including any applicable extensions, upon notice from BSGA, the trustee of the Trust Account will\ndistribute the amount in its Trust Account to its public shareholders. Concurrently, BSGA shall pay, or\nreserve for payment, from funds not held in trust, its liabilities and obligations, although BSGA cannot\nassure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as\npayments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately US$1,500,000 of\nproceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds\nfor such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust\naccount to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs\nand expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest\naccrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account\nbalance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to US$50,000 of such\naccrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.\nHowever, we may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As a result,\nour shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them\n(but no more) and any liability of our shareholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date\nof distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our shareholders amounts owed to them\nby us.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy\npetition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions\nreceived by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either\na\n87 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover\nall amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our Board may be viewed as having breached its\nfiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of\npunitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of\ncreditors.\nIf BSGA\u2019s due diligence investigation of Bitdeer was inadequate, then shareholders of BSGA following the Business\nCombination could lose some or all of their investment.\nEven though BSGA conducted a due diligence investigation of Bitdeer, it cannot be sure that this\ndiligence uncovered all material issues that may be present inside Bitdeer or its business, or that it would be\npossible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside\nof Bitdeer and its business and outside of its control will not later arise.\nShareholder litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations are expensive and could harm BSGA\u2019s business,\nfinancial condition and operating results and could divert management attention.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation and/or shareholder derivative litigation and inquiries or\ninvestigations by regulatory authorities have often followed certain significant business transactions, such\nas the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, such as the Business\nCombination. Any shareholder litigation and/or regulatory investigations against BSGA, whether or not\nresolved in BSGA\u2019s favor, could result in substantial costs and divert BSGA\u2019s management\u2019s attention from\nother business concerns, which could adversely affect BSGA\u2019s business and cash resources and the ultimate\nvalue BSGA Shareholders receive as a result of the Business Combination.\nThe Initial Shareholders who own ordinary shares and private placement units will not participate in liquidation\ndistributions and, therefore, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether the Business Combination is\nappropriate.\nAs of the Record Date, the Initial Shareholders owned an aggregate of 1,437,500 ordinary shares and\n292,500 ordinary shares underlying private placement units. They have waived their right to redeem these\nshares, or to receive distributions with respect to these shares upon the liquidation of the Trust Account if\nBSGA is unable to consummate a business combination. Based on a market price of US$10.73 per share on\nMarch 24, 2023, the value of these shares was approximately US$18.6 million. These ordinary shares acquired\nby the Initial Shareholders prior to the IPO will be worthless if BSGA does not consummate a business\ncombination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting Bitdeer as a\nsuitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions\nand timing of the Business Combination are appropriate and in BSGA\u2019s public shareholders\u2019 best interest.\nBSGA is requiring shareholders who wish to redeem their public shares in connection with a proposed business\ncombination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to\nexercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nBSGA is requiring shareholders who wish to redeem their ordinary shares to either tender their\ncertificates to Continental or to deliver their shares to Continental electronically using the DTC\u2019s DWAC\n(Deposit/\u200bWithdrawal At Custodian) System at least two business days before the Extraordinary General\nMeeting. In order to obtain a physical certificate, a shareholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and\nContinental will need to act to facilitate this request. It is BSGA\u2019s understanding that shareholders should\ngenerally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from Continental. However, because we do\nnot have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two\nweeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver\nshares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than\nBSGA anticipates for shareholders to deliver their ordinary shares, shareholders who wish to redeem may be\nunable to meet the deadline for exercising their redemption rights and thus may be unable to redeem their\nshares.\nBSGA will require its public shareholders who wish to redeem their public shares in connection with the Business\nCombination to comply with specific requirements for redemption described above, such redeeming shareholders\nmay be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the Business Combination is not\nconsummated.\nIf BSGA requires public shareholders who wish to redeem their public shares in connection with the\nproposed Business Combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption as described above\nand\n88 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Business Combination is not consummated, BSGA will promptly return such certificates to its public\nshareholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to redeem their public shares in such a circumstance\nwill be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until BSGA has returned their securities to\nthem. The market price for ordinary shares may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your\nsecurities when you wish to, even while other shareholders that did not seek redemption may be able to sell\ntheir securities.\nIf BSGA\u2019s security holders exercise their registration rights with respect to their securities, it may have an adverse\neffect on the market price of BSGA\u2019s securities.\nBSGA\u2019s Initial Shareholders are entitled to make a demand that it register the resale of their insider\nshares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from\nescrow. Additionally, our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors are entitled to demand that BSGA\nregister the resale of the shares underlying any securities our Initial Shareholders, officers, directors or their\naffiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us at any time after BSGA consummates\na business combination. If such persons exercise their registration rights with respect to all of their\nsecurities, then there will be an additional 1,787,500 ordinary shares eligible for trading in the public market.\nThe presence of these additional ordinary shares trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on\nthe market price of BSGA\u2019s securities. BSGA\u2019s Initial Shareholders may sell all or a significant portion of\nthese shares upon registration of such shares for resale even if the then trading price of BTG\u2019s securities is\nconsiderably lower than the current trading price of the BSGA Ordinary Shares, which may further exacerbate\nthe ability of securities of BSGA (or BTG upon Closing) to trade at a premium to its current market price.\nIf the Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market\nprice of BSGA\u2019s securities (or BTG\u2019s securities upon Closing) may decline.\nThe market price of BSGA\u2019s securities (or BTG\u2019s securities upon Closing) may decline as a result of the\nBusiness Combination if:\nBSGA does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly as, or to the extent\nanticipated by, financial or industry analysts\u037e or\nThe effect of the Business Combination on the financial statements is not consistent with the\nexpectations of financial or industry analysts.\nAccordingly, investors may experience a loss as a result of decreasing stock prices.\nBSGA\u2019s directors and officers may have certain conflicts in determining to recommend the acquisition of Bitdeer,\nsince certain of their interests, and certain interests of their affiliates and associates, are different from, or in\naddition to, your interests as a shareholder.\nBSGA\u2019s management and directors have interests in and arising from the Business Combination that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder, which could result in a real or perceived\nconflict of interest. These interests include the fact that certain of the ordinary shares owned by BSGA\u2019s\nmanagement and directors, or their affiliates and associates, would become worthless if the Business\nCombination Proposal is not approved and BSGA otherwise fails to consummate a business combination\nprior to the Combination Deadline. Given the difference between (i) the purchase price that the Sponsor paid\nfor the Founder Shares and (ii) the price of the Public Shares, and considering the substantial number of BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares that the Sponsor will receive upon conversion of the Founder Shares, the Sponsor\ncan earn a positive return on their investment, even if other BSGA shareholders have a negative return on\ntheir investment in BTG.\nIn addition, the Sponsor, BSGA\u2019s officers and directors, and their affiliates will benefit from the\ncompletion of a business combination, including in a manner that may not be aligned with the Public\nShareholders. As such, the Sponsor and BSGA\u2019s officers and directors may be incentivized to complete a\nbusiness combination with a less favorable target company or on terms less favorable to Public Shareholders\nrather than to liquidate. For more details on the interests of the Sponsor and BSGA\u2019s officers and directors,\nsee the sections entitled \u201cBSGA\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers\u202f-\u202fConflicts of Interest\u201d and \u201cThe\nBusiness Combination Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of BSGA Directors and Officers in the Business Combination.\u201d\n89 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBSGA and Bitdeer have incurred and expect to incur significant costs associated with the Business Combination.\nWhether or not the Business Combination is completed, the incurrence of these costs will reduce the amount of cash\navailable to be used for other corporate purposes by BSGA if the Business Combination is completed or by BSGA if\nthe Business Combination is not completed.\nBSGA and Bitdeer expect to incur significant costs associated with the Business Combination. Whether\nor not the Business Combination is completed, BSGA expects to incur approximately US$4.5 million in\nexpenses. These expenses will reduce the amount of cash available to be used for other corporate purposes\nby BSGA if the Business Combination is completed or by BSGA if the Business Combination is not\ncompleted.\nBSGA will incur significant transaction costs in connection with transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement.\nBSGA will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination. If the\nBusiness Combination is not consummated, BSGA may not have sufficient funds to seek an alternative\nbusiness combination and may be forced to liquidate and dissolve.\nIn the event that a significant number of Public Shares are redeemed, BTG\u2019s securities may become less liquid\nfollowing the Business Combination.\nIf a significant number of public shares are redeemed, BSGA may be left with a significantly smaller\nnumber of shareholders. As a result, trading in the shares of BTG may be limited and your ability to sell your\nshares in the market could be adversely affected. BTG intends to apply to list its BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares on Nasdaq, and Nasdaq may not list BTG\u2019s securities, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make\ntransactions in BSGA\u2019s securities and subject BSGA to additional trading restrictions.\nBTG will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. However, BTG\nmay be unable to maintain the listing of its securities in the future.\nIf BTG fails to meet the initial listing requirements and the continued listing requirements upon listing\nand Nasdaq delists its securities, BSGA could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\na limited availability of market quotations for its securities\u037e\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the company\u037e and\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nBSGA may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination without resoliciting shareholder\napproval for the Business Combination.\nBSGA may agree to waive, in whole or in part, some of the conditions to its obligations to complete the\nBusiness Combination, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. The Board will evaluate the materiality of\nany waiver to determine whether amendment of this proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies\nis warranted. In some instances, if the Board determines that a waiver is not sufficiently material to warrant\nresolicitation of shareholders, BSGA has the discretion to complete the Business Combination without\nseeking further shareholder approval. For example, it is a condition to BSGA\u2019s obligations to close the\nBusiness Combination that there be no restraining order, injunction or other order restricting Bitdeer\u2019s\nconduct of its business, however, if the Board determines that any such order or injunction is not material to\nthe business of Bitdeer, then the Board may elect to waive that condition without shareholder approval and\nclose the Business Combination.\nBSGA Shareholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of BTG Ordinary Shares as\nconsideration in the Business Combination and from other dilution sources. Having a minority share position may\nreduce the influence that the non-redeeming BSGA shareholders have on the management of BTG upon Closing.\nThe issuance of additional BTG Ordinary Shares in the Business Combination will dilute the equity\ninterests of the Public Shareholders and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Public Shares\n90 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nupon Closing. The Public Shareholders who do not redeem their Public Shares may experience dilution from a\nnumber of sources to varying degrees in connection with and after the Business Combination. The impact of\ndilution from the issuance of BTG Ordinary Shares in connection with and after the Business Combination\non a fully diluted basis is as follows:\nApproximately 108,758,873 BTG Ordinary Shares are anticipated to be issued to holders of Bitdeer\nShares as consideration in the Business Combination, valued at US$10.00 per share. This issuance\nrepresents approximately (a) 78.3% and 79.3%, respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary Shares\nthat will be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, under the no\nredemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, and (b) 94.8% and 95.1%, respectively, of\nthe total voting power of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the consummation\nof the Business Combination, assuming the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption\nscenario.\n1,437,500 Founder Shares and 292,500 BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares currently held by the Sponsor\nand BSGA rights entitling the Sponsor to purchase 29,250 BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will be\nconverted into BTG Ordinary Shares in the Business Combination, valued at US$10.00 per share.\nThese shares represent approximately (a) 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary\nShares that will be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, under the\nno redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, and (b) 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively,\nof the total voting power of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, under the no redemption scenario and the maximum\nredemption scenario.\nup to 4,077,203 BTG Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon conversion of US$30,000,000 principal\namount of the Bitdeer Convertible Note. This issuance represents approximately (a) 2.9% and 3.0%,\nrespectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, under the no redemption scenario and the maximum\nredemption scenario, and (b) 0.7% and 0.7%, respectively, of the total voting power of BTG Ordinary\nShares that will be outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, assuming\nthe no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario.\nup to 21,893,567 BTG Ordinary Shares that will be available for issuance under the Bitdeer Plan. This\nissuance represents (a) 15.8% and 16.0%, respectively, of the number of BTG Ordinary Shares that will\nbe outstanding following the consummation of the Business Combination, under the no redemption\nscenario and the maximum redemption scenario, and (b) 3.8% and 3.8%, respectively, of the total\nvoting power of BTG Ordinary Shares that will be outstanding following the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination, assuming the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario.\nTaking into consideration the foregoing sources of dilution, immediately after the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination, the Public Shareholders will hold (a) 2,293,388 shares of BTG Ordinary Shares, or\n1.7% of the outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares under the no redemption scenario and (b) 575,000 shares of\nBTG Ordinary Shares, or 0.4 % of the outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares assuming that public shareholders\nexercise their redemption rights with respect to 1,718,388 Public Shares (the maximum amount of redemption)\nimmediately after the consummation of the Business Combination. Following the consummation of the\nBusiness combination, the Public Shareholders will have approximately 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively, of the\nvoting power under the no redemption scenario and the maximum redemption scenario, respectively. For\nmore information, please see the section entitled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial\nInformation.\u201d\nThe issuance of additional BTG Ordinary Shares, including through any of the potential dilution\nsources, could have the following effects for Public Shareholders who elect not to redeem their shares:\nyour proportionate ownership interest in BTG will decrease\u037e\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares will be diminished\u037e\nand\nthe market price of the BTG Ordinary Shares may decline.\n91 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of important conditions, and the Merger\nAgreement may be terminated before the completion of the Business Combination in accordance with its terms. As a\nresult, there is no assurance that the Business Combination will be completed.\nThe completion of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of a\nnumber of important conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the approval of the Business\nCombination by the shareholders of BSGA, listing approval by Nasdaq, and several other customary closing\nconditions. Since these conditions are not satisfied or, if applicable, waived by the Outside Closing Date, the\nMerger Agreement may be terminated by either party under which circumstance the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement will not consummate and you will not receive the Merger\nConsideration. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cThe Business Combination Proposal\u202f-\u202fThe\nMerger Agreement.\u201d\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information included in this proxy\nstatement/\u200bprospectus may not be representative of our results after the Business Combination.\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative\nof the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the transactions been\nconsummated as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of BTG\u2019s future operating results or financial\nposition after the assumed consummation of the transactions. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed\nCombined Financial Statements present the combination of our financial information and the financial\ninformation of Blue Safari after giving effect to the Business Combination and related adjustments described\nin the accompanying notes. See the section entitled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial\nInformation.\u201d\nThe Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not reflect future events that\nmay occur, including any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the Business Combination, and does\nnot consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenue or expense. The Unaudited Pro Forma\nCondensed Combined Financial Statements are based in part on certain assumptions that we believe are\nreasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate over time.\nYou are being offered a fixed number BTG Ordinary Shares, which involves the risk of market fluctuations.\nYou will receive a fixed number of BTG Ordinary Shares in the Business Combination, rather than BTG\nOrdinary Shares with a fixed market value. Consequently, the market value of BTG Ordinary Shares, and of\nthe BSGA Ordinary Shares at the time of the completion of the Business Combination, may fluctuate\nsignificantly from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, and the exchange ratio in the Business\nCombination might not be reflective of future market price ratios of BTG relative to BSGA securities. In\naddition, the market price of BSGA Ordinary Shares may be adversely affected by arbitrage activities\noccurring prior to the completion of the Business Combination. These sales, or the prospects of such sales\nin the future, could adversely affect the market price for, and the ability to sell in the market, BSGA Ordinary\nShares before the Business Combination is completed and BTG Ordinary Shares after the Business\nCombination is completed.\nYour ownership percentage in BTG will be less than the ownership percentage you currently hold in BSGA.\nYour ownership percentage in BTG Ordinary Shares following the Business Combination will be less\nthan your existing ownership percentage in Blue Safari as a result of dilution attributable to the relative\nequity values of the companies involved in the Business Combination. Immediately after the Business\nCombination, it is anticipated that (i) the former shareholders of Blue Safari will hold as a group\napproximately 3.4% of the BTG Ordinary Shares and (ii) the current shareholders of Bitdeer will hold as a\ngroup approximately 96.6% of the outstanding capital stock of BTG. As a result, you may have less influence\nover matters submitted to a vote of BTG shareholders.\nThe Initial Mergers may be a taxable event for U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BSGA Rights.\nSubject to the limitations and qualifications described in the section entitled \u201cMaterial Tax\nConsiderations\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fConsequences of the Business\n92 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCombination,\u201d BSGA intends to treat the Initial Mergers as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section\n368 of the Code. If this treatment applies, a U.S. Holder (as defined in \u201cMaterial Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fMaterial\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d) of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will not recognize gain or loss\non the exchange of the shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business Combination.\nWhile it is not entirely clear, BSGA intends to take the position (to the extent required to do so) that U.S.\nHolders of BSGA Rights that exchange the underlying BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the\nBusiness Combination would be treated in the same manner. However, there can be no assurance that the\nIRS will not assert that the Initial Mergers (or either of the First SPAC Merger or the Second SPAC Merger)\ndo not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, or otherwise as a tax-free\ntransaction. In that case, a U.S. Holder that exchanges its BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (including shares\nreceived upon the conversion of BSGA Rights) for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business\nCombination will be required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair\nmarket value of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the\nBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares exchanged. In addition, unless the Initial Mergers qualify as an \u201cF\nreorganization\u201d it is possible that the passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) rules, further described\nbelow, could apply to the transfer of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BSGA Rights pursuant to the\nInitial Mergers, depending on BTG\u2019s PFIC status. U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BSGA\nRights should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial\nMergers, including in the event that they do not qualify for a tax-free treatment.\nBecoming a public company through a business combination rather than an underwritten offering presents risks to\nunaffiliated investors of BTG. Subsequent to the completion of the Business Combination, BTG may be required to\nsubsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a\nsignificant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and the price of BTG securities, which\ncould cause BTG shareholders to lose some or all of their investment.\nA traditional initial public offering involves a company engaging underwriters to purchase its shares\nand resell them to the public. An underwritten offering imposes statutory liability on the underwriters for\nmaterial misstatements or omissions contained in the registration statement unless they are able to sustain\nthe burden of proving that they did not know and could not reasonably have discovered such material\nmisstatements or omissions. This is referred to as a \u201cdue diligence\u201d defense and results in the underwriters\nundertaking a detailed review of the business, financial condition and results of operations of the issuer and\nits subsidiaries. In a traditional initial public offering, investors may be able to recover damages from the\nunderwriters in the event of misstatements and omissions in the registration statement and unavailability of\nthe due diligence defense. Going public via a business combination with a special purpose acquisition\ncompany (\u201cSPAC\u201d) does not involve any underwriters and may therefore result in less extensive vetting of\nthe operating company\u2019s information that is presented to the public. In addition, going public via a business\ncombination with a SPAC does not involve a book-building process as is the case in a traditional initial\npublic offering. In a traditional initial public offering, the initial value of a company is set by investors who\nindicate the price at which they are prepared to purchase shares from the underwriters. In the case of a\nbusiness combination involving a SPAC, the value of the target company is established by means of\nnegotiations between the target company and the SPAC. The process of establishing the value of a target\ncompany in a SPAC business combination may be less effective than a traditional initial public offering book-\nbuilding process and also does not reflect events that may have occurred between the date of the Merger\nAgreement and the Closing.\nIn addition, while traditional initial public offerings are sometimes oversubscribed, resulting in\nadditional potential demand for shares in the after-market following the initial public offering, there is no\ncomparable process of generating investor demand in connection with a business combination between a\ntarget company and a SPAC, which may result in lower demand for BTG\u2019s securities after the Closing, and in\nturn could decrease liquidity and trading prices as well as increase the trading volatility of BTG securities.\nBased on the assumptions set out elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, out of the aggregate\n112,869,011 BTG Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding upon consummation of the Business Combination,\nMr. Jihan Wu will hold 48,434,554 BTG Class V Ordinary Shares, with ten votes per share, constituting\napproximately 88.3% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class.\nFormer Bitdeer shareholders other than Mr. Jihan Wu will own 60,324,319 BTG Class A ordinary Shares,\nconstituting approximately 93.6% of the aggregate outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, and\napproximately 11.0% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class. This\nconcentration of ownership may\n93 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndiscourage, delay or prevent a change in control which could deprive shareholders of an opportunity to\nreceive a premium to the trading price for the shares as part of a sale of BTG, and in turn could affect the\nmarket demand for BTG securities.\nBecoming a public company through a business combination rather than an underwritten offering, as\nBitdeer is seeking to do, presents risks to unaffiliated investors as described above. As a result, BTG, as the\npost-Business Combination company, may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure its\noperations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in it reporting losses. Additionally,\nunexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize. Even though these charges may be\nnon-cash items and not have an immediate impact on BTG\u2019s liquidity, the fact that BTG reports charges of\nthis nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about it or its securities. In addition, charges of\nthis nature may make it difficult for BTG to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe SEC has issued proposed rules to regulate SPACs. Certain of the procedures that BSGA, a potential business\ncombination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase the costs\nand the time needed to complete a business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which BSGA\ncould complete a business combination.\nOn March 30, 2022, the SEC issued the SPAC Rule Proposals relating to, among other items, disclosures\nin SEC filings in connection with business combination transactions between SPACs such as BSGA and\nprivate operating companies\u037e the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell\ncompanies\u037e the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination\ntransactions\u037e the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions\u037e\nand the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act,\nincluding a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company\nif they satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC\u2019s duration, asset composition, business purpose and\nactivities. The SPAC Rule Proposals have not yet been adopted and may be adopted in the proposed form or\nin a different form that could impose additional regulatory requirements on SPACs. Certain of the procedures\nthat BSGA, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with\nthe SPAC Rule Proposals, or pursuant to the SEC\u2019s views expressed in the SPAC Rule Proposals, may\nincrease the costs of negotiating and completing a business combination and the time required to\nconsummate the circumstances under which BSGA could complete a business combination.\nIf BSGA were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, BSGA would be\nrequired to meet burdensome compliance requirements and its activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in\nsuch circumstances, unless BSGA is able to modify its activities so that it would not be deemed an investment\ncompany, BSGA would expect to abandon the efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to\nliquidate itself.\nAs described further above, the SPAC Rule Proposals relate, among other matters, to the circumstances\nin which SPACs such as BSGA could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the\nregulations thereunder. The SPAC Rule Proposals would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the\ndefinition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that\na SPAC satisfies certain criteria, including a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC\ntransaction. Specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the SPAC Rule Proposals would require a company\nto file a report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for a\nbusiness combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of its registration statement for its\ninitial public offering (the \u201cIPO Registration Statement\u201d). BSGA would then be required to complete its initial\nbusiness combination no later than 24 months after the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement.\nAs a result, there is a risk concerning the implications of the Investment Company Act on a SPAC,\nincluding a company like BSGA, that may not complete its business combination within 24 months after the\neffective date of the IPO Registration Statement. It is possible that a claim could be made that BSGA has\nbeen operating as an unregistered investment company.\nIf BSGA were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, its activities\nwould be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. Although BSGA does not believe that its\nprincipal activities will subject itself to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company\nAct, if\n94 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBSGA is deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the\nInvestment Company Act, BSGA would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which\nBSGA has not allotted funds. As a result, unless BSGA were able to modify its activities so that BSGA would\nnot be deemed an investment company, BSGA would expect to abandon its efforts to complete an initial\nbusiness combination and instead to liquidate itself.\nTo mitigate the risk that BSGA might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment\nCompany Act, BSGA may, at any time, instruct the trustee to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and\ninstead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash until the earlier of the consummation of an initial business\ncombination or its liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of securities in the Trust Account, BSGA would\nlikely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount\nthe public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of BSGA.\nThe funds in the Trust Account have, since the initial public offering of BSGA, been held only in U.S.\ngovernment treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in\nU.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.\nHowever, to mitigate the risk of BSGA being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including\nunder the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to\nregulation under the Investment Company Act, BSGA may, at any time, on or prior to the 24-month\nanniversary of the effective date of its IPO Registration Statement, instruct Continental Stock Transfer &\nTrust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury\nobligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust\nAccount in cash until the earlier of consummation of the initial business combination or liquidation of BSGA.\nFollowing such liquidation, BSGA would likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust\nAccount. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released\nto BSGA to pay its taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, any decision to\nliquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in\ncash could reduce the dollar amount the public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or\nliquidation of BSGA.\nIn addition, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of its IPO Registration\nStatement, BSGA may be deemed to be an investment company, in which case BSGA may be required to\nliquidate BSGA. Accordingly, BSGA may determine, in its discretion, to liquidate the securities held in the\nTrust Account at any time, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of its IPO Registration Statement, and\ninstead hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash, which would further reduce the dollar amount the public\nshareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of BSGA.\nRisks Related to BTG\nA market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of\nBTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nAn active trading market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may never develop or, if developed, it may\nnot be sustained. You may be unable to sell your BTG Class A Ordinary Shares unless a market can be\nestablished and sustained. This risk will be exacerbated if there is a high level of redemptions of Public\nShares in connection with the Closing, which leads to a significantly reduced number of public shareholders\nholding BTG securities subsequent to the Closing.\nThe market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment\nUpon consummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, the price of BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\nchanges in the industries in which Bitdeer operates\u037e\ndevelopments involving Bitdeer\u2019s competitors\u037e\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting Bitdeer\u2019s business\u037e\n95 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvariations in Bitdeer\u2019s operating performance and the performance of its competitors in general\u037e\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in Bitdeer\u2019s quarterly or annual operating results\u037e\npublication of research reports by securities analysts about Bitdeer or its competitors or its industry\u037e\nthe public\u2019s reaction to Bitdeer\u2019s press releases, its other public announcements and its filings with\nthe SEC\u037e\nactions by holders in respect of any of their BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\u037e\nadditions and departures of key personnel\u037e\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving BTG\u037e\nchanges in Bitdeer\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of\ndebt\u037e\nthe volume of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares available for public sale\u037e and\ngeneral economic and political conditions, such as the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, recessions,\nvolatility in the markets, interest rates, local and national elections, fuel prices, international currency\nfluctuations, corruption, political instability, and acts of war or terrorism.\nIn particular, the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could be subject to extreme volatility and\nfluctuations in response to industry-wide developments beyond its control, such as continued industry-\nwide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of cryptocurrency exchanges FTX (including its\naffiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, crypto miners Compute\nNorth and Core Scientific and crypto lenders Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and BlockFi. Although, as\nmentioned elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Bitdeer has no exposure to any of the\ncryptocurrency market participants that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or who are known to have\nexperienced excessive redemptions, suspended redemptions or have crypto assets of their customers\nunaccounted for\u037e and Bitdeer does not have any assets, material or otherwise, that may not be recovered due\nto these bankruptcies or excessive or suspended redemptions\u037e the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may\nstill not be immune to unfavorable investor sentiment resulting from these recent developments in the\nbroader cryptocurrency industry and you may experience depreciation of price of BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares.\nBTG will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing rules and, as a result, will\nqualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. If BTG relies on these exemptions, you will\nnot have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nUpon the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control a majority of the voting power\nof BTG\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, BTG will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning\nof applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting\npower for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled\ncompany.\u201d For so long as BTG remains a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d it may elect not to comply with certain\ncorporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\nthat a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors\u037e\nfor an annual performance evaluation of the nominating, corporate governance and compensation\ncommittees\u037e\nthat it has a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of\nindependent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities\u037e\nand\nthat it has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a\nwritten charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibility.\nBTG intends to use these exemptions upon the closing of the Business Combination and it may\ncontinue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future. As a result, you may not have the same\nprotections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate\ngovernance requirements.\n96 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBTG will issue BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, and BTG Class V Ordinary Shares convertible into BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares, as consideration for the Business Combination, and BTG may issue additional BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities without approval of the holders of BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares, which would dilute existing ownership interests and may depress the market price of BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares.\nIt is anticipated that, following the Business Combination, (i) former Bitdeer shareholders (other than\nthe founder, Mr. Wu Jihan and the entity controlled by him (\u201cBitdeer Founders\u201d) are expected to own\napproximately 93.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, constituting approximately 11.0% of\nthe voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class, (ii) the Bitdeer Founders are\nexpected to own 100.0% of the outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares, constituting approximately 88.3%\nof the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class, (iii) former BSGA\nShareholders are expected to own approximately 3.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares,\nconstituting approximately 0.4% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single\nclass, and (iv) the BSGA Sponsor, the Sponsor Affiliates and directors are expected to own approximately\n2.8% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, constituting 0.3% of the voting power of the BTG\nOrdinary Shares voting together as a single class. These percentages assume (i) none of Bitdeer\u2019s\noutstanding restricted share units vest\u037e (ii) no interest accrued on Bitdeer Convertible Note and (ii) the No\nRedemption Scenario. If the actual facts differ from these assumptions, these percentages will differ.\nBTG will continue to require significant capital investment to support its business, and BTG may issue\nadditional BTG Class A Ordinary Shares or other equity or convertible debt securities of equal or senior rank\nin the future without approval of the holders of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in certain circumstances.\nBTG\u2019s issuance of additional BTG Class A Ordinary Shares or convertible debt securities of equal or\nsenior rank would have the following effects: (i) BTG\u2019s existing holders\u2019 of ordinary shares proportionate\nownership interest in BTG may decrease\u037e (ii) the amount of cash available per BTG Ordinary Share, including\nfor payment of dividends in the future, may decrease\u037e (iii) the relative voting power of each previously\noutstanding BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be diminished\u037e and (iv) the market price of BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares may decline. Under certain circumstances, each BTG Class V Ordinary Share will\nautomatically convert into one BTG Class A Ordinary Share (as adjusted for share splits, share combination\nand similar transactions occurring), but as the conversion ratio is one-to-one, such mandatory conversion\nwould not have a dilutive effect. See the section entitled \u201cDescription of BTG Securities\u202f-\u202fOrdinary Shares.\u201d\nFurthermore, employees, directors and consultants of BTG and its subsidiaries and affiliates hold, and\nafter Business Combination, are expected to be granted equity awards under the BTG Incentive Plan. You will\nexperience additional dilution when those equity awards become vested and exercised, for BTG Ordinary\nShares. See the section entitled \u201cThe BTG Incentive Plan Proposal\u202f-\u202fSummary of the BTG Incentive Plan.\u201d\nBTG\u2019s dual-class voting structure may limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others\nfrom pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of BTG\u2019s Class A Ordinary Shares may view as\nbeneficial.\nBTG\u2019s authorized and issued ordinary shares will be divided into Class A Ordinary Shares and Class V\nOrdinary Shares. Each Class A Ordinary Share will be entitled to one vote, while each Class V Ordinary Share\nwill be entitled to ten (10) votes. Only BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be listed and traded on Nasdaq and\nBTG intends to maintain the dual-class voting structure after the consummation of the Business\nCombination.\nMr. Jihan Wu will hold all of the outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares. As a result, it is expected\nthat Mr. Jihan Wu will, assuming a No Redemption Scenario and that all of Bitdeer\u2019s outstanding stock\noptions are exercised, control approximately 88.3% of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding\nBTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class immediately following the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination. Further Mr. Jihan Wu will, by virtue of his control of approximately 88.3% of that\ntotal voting power, effectively have the right to nominate, appoint and remove all of the board of directors.\nFor further information, see the section entitled \u201cDescription of BTG Securities.\u201d\nThe dual-class structure of BTG\u2019s ordinary shares may adversely affect price and liquidity of BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares.\nS&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for\ninclusion of shares of public companies in certain indices, including the S&P 500, to exclude companies with\n97 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmultiple classes of shares and companies whose public shareholders hold no more than 5% of total voting\npower from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced\ntheir opposition to the use of multiple class capital structures. As a result, the dual-class structure of BTG\u2019s\nordinary shares may prevent the inclusion of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in such indices and may\ncause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about BTG\u2019s corporate governance\npractices or otherwise seek to cause BTG to change its capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices\ncould result in a less active trading market for the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. Any actions or publications\nby shareholder advisory firms critical of BTG\u2019s corporate governance practices or capital structure could\nalso adversely affect the value of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nVolatility in the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could subject BTG to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a\ndecline in the market price of its securities. If BTG faces such litigation, it could result in substantial costs\nand a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm its business.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales of, a substantial number of BTG Ordinary Shares may depress the price\nof such securities.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of BTG Ordinary Shares in the public market after the closing of the\nBusiness Combination, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of BTG\nOrdinary Shares and could impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain BTG\u2019s resources, divert BTG management\u2019s attention and\naffect BTG\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nBTG will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, the Dodd-Frank Act, Nasdaq listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations.\nAs such, BTG will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses following the completion of the\nBusiness Combination. These expenses may increase even more if BTG no longer qualifies as an \u201cemerging\ngrowth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other\nthings, that BTG file annual and current reports with respect to its business and operating results. The\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that BTG maintains effective disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting. BTG may need to hire more employees post-\nBusiness Combination or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase\nits post-Business Combination costs and expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are\ncreating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some\nactivities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations,\nin many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over\ntime as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing\nuncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure\nand governance practices. BTG expects these laws and regulations to increase its legal and financial\ncompliance costs after the Business Combination and to render some activities more time-consuming and\ncostly, although BTG is currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty.\nMany members of BTG\u2019s management team will have limited experience managing a publicly traded\ncompany, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws\npertaining to public companies. BTG\u2019s management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the\ntransition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations\nunder the federal securities laws and regulations and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and\ninvestors. The need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the\nmanagement\u2019s attention from implementing its growth strategy, which could prevent BTG from improving its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, BTG expects these rules and\nregulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for BTG to obtain director and officer liability\ninsurance, and consequently BTG may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar\ncoverage. These\n98 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nadditional obligations could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for BTG to attract and retain\nqualified members of its board of directors, particularly to serve on BTG\u2019s finance and audit committee and\nnomination and compensation committee, and to attract and retain qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this proxy statement/prospectus and in filings required of a\npublic company, BTG\u2019s business and financial condition will become more visible, which BTG believes may\nresult in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are\nsuccessful, BTG\u2019s business and operating results could be adversely affected, and, even if the claims do not\nresult in litigation or are resolved in BTG\u2019s favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to\nresolve them, could cause an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations,\nprospects and reputation.\nBitdeer has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. In the event of any failure\nto maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, BTG may not be\nable to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\ncould lose confidence in BTG\u2019s financial and other public reporting, which is likely to negatively affect BTG\u2019s\nbusiness and the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nPrior to the Closing of the Business Combination, Bitdeer has been a private company with limited\naccounting personnel and other resources with which to address Bitdeer\u2019s internal controls and procedures.\nBitdeer\u2019s management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Bitdeer\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting and Bitdeer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an\naudit of Bitdeer\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBitdeer identified a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness over financial reporting\nwith respect to the Internal Control\u202f-\u202fIntegrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), concerning in particular the control\nenvironment due to lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate\nknowledge to design, implement and operate key controls over financial reporting process to address\ncomplex and emerging technical accounting issues and related disclosures in accordance with IFRS. A\nmaterial weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Bitdeer\u2019s annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a consequence of this material weakness,\naccounting errors were identified in Bitdeer\u2019s combined statements of operations and comprehensive loss\nand cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 primarily related to revenue\npresentation in relation to the sales of mining machine business and the cash flow presentation related to the\ndisposal of cryptocurrencies earned from revenue arrangements. The revenue and cost of revenue on the\ncombined statements of operations and comprehensive loss and the operating and investing cash flows on\nthe combined statements of cash flows have been restated as included in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nThe material weakness could also result in other misstatements of Bitdeer\u2019s accounts or disclosures, which\nmay result in additional material misstatements in Bitdeer\u2019s annual or interim financial statements that would\nnot be prevented or detected.\nBitdeer has instituted plans to remediate the material weakness, including implementation of appropriate\nprocesses with the objective of improving the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. In particular,\nBitdeer expects to invest more resources in its design and execution of its Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance\nprogram, such as reassessing existing entity-level controls and, as necessary, implementing enhancements to\nsuch controls. However, Bitdeer cannot predict the success of such plan or the outcome of its assessment of\nthese plans at this time. If Bitdeer is unable to remediate the material weakness it has identified, or if it\nidentifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to develop and maintain an effective\nsystem of internal controls, Bitdeer may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. The\nfailure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in\nBitdeer\u2019s financial statements that could result in a restatement of its financial statements, which in turn\ncould have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, BTG cannot assure you that BTG will not identify material weaknesses after the Business\nCombination. Upon becoming a public company, BTG will be subject to the reporting requirements of the\nExchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of\nthe\n99 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNasdaq. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public\naccounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of BTG\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting that BTG will eventually be required to include in BTG\u2019s periodic reports that will be filed with the\nSEC. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose BTG to increased risk of fraud or\nmisuse of corporate assets and subject BTG to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which BTG is\nlisted, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. BTG may also be required to restate its\nfinancial statements from prior periods. If BTG fails to achieve and maintain an effective internal control\nenvironment, it could suffer material misstatements in its financial statements and fail to meet its reporting\nobligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in BTG\u2019s reported financial information.\nThis could in turn limit BTG\u2019s access to capital markets, harm its financial condition and results of\noperations, and lead to a decline in the market price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nRecent market volatility could impact the stock price and trading volume of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nThe trading market for the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could be impacted by recent market volatility.\nWhile Bitdeer does not believe that it is more likely to be affected by market volatility than other public\ncompanies, recent stock run-ups, divergences in valuation ratios relative to those seen during traditional\nmarkets, high short interest or short squeezes, and strong and atypical retail investor interest in the markets\nmay impact the demand for the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nA possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that\nlargely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. Investors may\npurchase BTG Class A Ordinary Shares to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of the BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares. Speculation on the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may involve both long\nand short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares available for purchase (for example, in the event that large redemption requests dramatically affect\nliquidity), investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares for delivery to lenders. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of the BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to\nvolatile price movements in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that are not directly correlated to the operating\nperformance of Bitdeer.\nIt is not expected that BTG will pay dividends in the foreseeable future after the Business Combination.\nIt is expected that BTG will retain most, if not all, of its available funds and any future earnings after the\nBusiness Combination to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, it is not expected\nthat BTG will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nFollowing completion of the Business Combination, BTG\u2019s board of directors will have complete\ndiscretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if the board of directors decides to declare and pay\ndividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on the future results of\noperations and cash flow, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by\nBTG from subsidiaries, BTG\u2019s financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant\nby the board of directors. There is no guarantee that the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will appreciate in\nvalue after the Business Combination or that the trading price of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will not\ndecline.\nIf securities and industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or cease\npublishing research about BTG, the price and trading volume of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares could decline\nsignificantly.\nThe trading market for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will depend, in part, on the research and reports\nthat securities or industry analysts publish about BTG or its business. BTG may be unable to sustain\ncoverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of\nsecurities or industry analysts maintain coverage of BTG, or if these securities or industry analysts are not\nwidely respected within the general investment community, the demand for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\ncould decrease, which might cause its price and trading volume to decline significantly. In the event that\nBTG obtains securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover BTG\ndowngrade their assessment of\n100 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBTG or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about BTG\u2019s business, the market price and liquidity for\nBTG Class A Ordinary Shares could be negatively impacted.\nBTG is a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such it is exempt\nfrom certain provisions applicable to domestic public companies in the United States.\nBecause BTG is a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, it is exempt from certain provisions of\nthe securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers,\nincluding: (i) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K with the SEC\u037e (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of\nproxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act\u037e (iii) the\nsections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading\nactivities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time\u037e and (iv) the selective\ndisclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.\nBTG will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal\nyear. In addition, BTG intends to publish its results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed\npursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material\nevents will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information Bitdeer is required to file\nwith or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the\nSEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information,\nwhich would be made available to you, were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\nAs an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BTG is permitted to adopt certain home country\npractices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ significantly from Nasdaq corporate governance\nlisting standards\u037e these practices may afford less protection to holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares than they\nwould enjoy if BTG complied fully with Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards.\nBTG is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and, after the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, will be listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq market rules\npermit a foreign private issuer like BTG to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country.\nCertain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is BTG\u2019s home country, may differ\nsignificantly from Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards applicable to domestic U.S. companies.\nAmong other things, BTG is not required to have: (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of\nindependent directors\u037e (ii) a compensation committee consisting of independent directors\u037e (iii) a nominating\ncommittee consisting of independent directors\u037e or (iv) regularly scheduled executive sessions with only\nindependent directors each year.\nAlthough not required and as may be changed from time to time, BTG intends to have, as of the\nconsummation of the Business Combination at the Closing on the Closing Date, a majority-independent\nboard of directors, a majority-independent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to\nthe foregoing, BTG intends to rely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with\nthe benefits of certain corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq applicable to U.S. domestic public\ncompanies. See the section entitled \u201cBTG\u2019s Directors and Officers Following the Business Combination\u202f-\u202f\nForeign Private Issuer Status.\u201d\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may\nbe limited, because BTG is incorporated under the law of the Cayman Islands, BTG conducts a substantial portion\nof its operations and a majority of its directors and executive officers reside outside of the United States.\nBTG is an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and\nfollowing the Business Combination, will conduct a substantial portion of its operations through its\nsubsidiary, Bitdeer, outside the United States. A substantial portion of BTG\u2019s assets are located outside of\nthe United States. A majority of BTG\u2019s officers and directors reside outside the United States and a\nsubstantial portion of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it\ncould be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against BTG or against these individuals outside\nof the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed upon under the\napplicable securities laws or\n101 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\notherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and\nof the jurisdictions that comprise the Southeast Asian region could render you unable to enforce a judgment\nagainst BTG\u2019s assets or the assets of BTG\u2019s directors and officers.\nIn addition, BTG\u2019s corporate affairs will be governed by the amended and restated memorandum and\narticles of association of BTG, the Cayman Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The\ncommon law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the\nCayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive\nauthority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of BTG\u2019s ordinary shareholders\nand the fiduciary duties of BTG\u2019s directors under Cayman Islands law may not be as clearly established as\nthey would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular,\nthe Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as\nDelaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman\nIslands.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like BTG have no general rights under Cayman\nIslands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies.\nBTG\u2019s directors will have discretion under the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association\nof BTG to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, BTG\u2019s corporate records may be inspected\nby its ordinary shareholders, but BTG is not obliged to make them available to the ordinary shareholders.\nThis may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for\na shareholder to motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest. See\nthe section entitled \u201cDescription of BTG Securities\u202f-\u202fOrdinary Shares\u202f-\u202fInspection of Books and Records.\u201d\nCertain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is BTG\u2019s home country, differ\nsignificantly from requirements for companies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States.\nTo the extent BTG chooses to follow home country practice with respect to corporate governance matters, its\nshareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations\napplicable to U.S. domestic issuers. See the section entitled \u201cBTG\u2019s Directors and Officers Following the\nBusiness Combination\u202f-\u202fForeign Private Issuer Status.\u201d\nAs a result of all of the above, BTG\u2019s shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests\nin the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders\nthan they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.\nBTG is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the federal securities laws, and BTG cannot be certain if\nthe reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make the BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares less attractive to investors.\nBTG is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Securities Act, and BTG intends to take\nadvantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies, including, among other things, not being required to\ncomply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a\nnonbinding shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden\nparachute payments not previously approved. As a result, holders of BTG Ordinary Shares may not have\naccess to certain information that they may deem important.\nBTG will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a)\nfollowing the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, (b) in which BTG has total annual\ngross revenues of at least US$1.07 billion, (c) or in which BTG is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which\nmeans the market value of BTG\u2019s Shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds US$700 million as of the last\nbusiness day of BTG\u2019s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which BTG issued more than US$1.0\nbillion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. If some investors find the BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares, the price of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be more volatile and the price of the BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares may decline.\n102 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe believe that BSGA (the predecessor to BTG) was a PFIC for its 2021 and 2022 taxable years, and BTG may be\nor become a PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of BTG Class\nA Ordinary Shares.\nIn general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in\nwhich (i) 50% or more of the average value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a weighted\nquarterly average) consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income, or (ii)\n75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends,\ninterest, royalties, rents, investment gains, net gains from the sales of property that does not give rise to any\nincome and net gains from the sale of commodities (subject to certain exceptions, such as an exception for\ncertain income derived in the active conduct of a trade or business). Cash and cash equivalents are, and\ncryptocurrency balances are likely, passive assets. The value of goodwill will generally be treated as an\nactive or passive asset based on the nature of the income produced in the activity to which the goodwill is\nattributable. For purposes of the PFIC rules, a non-U.S. corporation that owns, directly or indirectly, at least\n25% by value of the stock of another corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of the assets\nof the other corporation, and received directly its proportionate share of the income of the other corporation.\nBSGA believes that it did not qualify for the PFIC \u201cstart-up exception\u201d  (as described in \u201cMaterial\nTaxation Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Passive Foreign Investment\nCompany Rules\u201d) for its taxable year ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, because BSGA is a blank-check\ncompany with no current active business, based on the composition of BSGA\u2019s income and assets, BSGA\nbelieves that it was a PFIC for its taxable years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.\nFurthermore, the PFIC status of BSGA may affect the PFIC status of BTG for BTG\u2019s taxable year ending\nDecember 31, 2023. Assuming that the Initial Mergers qualify as a Reorganization, BTG should be treated as\nthe same corporation as BSGA for purposes of the PFIC rules. Depending on the closing date of the\nBusiness Combination and the composition of BTG\u2019s income and assets and the estimated value of BTG\u2019s\nassets, including goodwill, BTG may be a PFIC for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023. BTG\u2019s PFIC\nstatus for any taxable year is a factual annual determination that can be made only after the end of that year\nand will depend on the composition of BTG\u2019s income and assets and the value of its assets from time to time\n(including the value of its goodwill, which may be determined in large part by reference to the market price of\nthe BTG Class A Ordinary Shares from time to time, which could be volatile) and, for the taxable year in which\nthe Business Combination occurs, the income and assets, and the value of the assets, of its predecessor\nBSGA (assuming that the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization). In addition, the risk of BTG being a\nPFIC for any taxable year will increase if its market capitalization declines substantially during that year.\nFurthermore, whether and to which extent BTG\u2019s income and assets, including goodwill, will be characterized\nas active or passive will depend on various factors that are subject to uncertainty, including BTG\u2019s future\nbusiness plan and the application of laws that are subject to varying interpretation. For example, there is no\nauthority that directly addresses the proper treatment of certain items of BTG\u2019s income, such as income from\nproprietary cryptocurrency mining, hash rate sharing, or hosting for purposes of the PFIC rules and,\nalthough BTG currently treats these items of income as active, such treatment is uncertain. Moreover, certain\nof BTG\u2019s business activities generate passive income and, although the amount of such income is currently\nsmall, BTG\u2019s risk of being a PFIC will increase if the proportion of BTG\u2019s revenue earned from such business\nactivities increases in future taxable years. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that BTG will not be a\nPFIC for its current or any future taxable year.\nEven if BTG is not a PFIC for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023 or any subsequent taxable year,\nif BSGA is or was a PFIC (as BSGA believes to be the case for its 2021 and 2022 taxable years, and which may\nbe the case for its 2023 taxable year) for any taxable year during the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as\ndefined in \u201cMaterial Taxation Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d) in its\nBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (including BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares received with respect to BSGA\nRights), and such U.S. Holder did not (or could not) make any of the PFIC Elections discussed under\n\u201cMaterial Taxation Considerations - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations \u202f-\u202f Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company Rules\u201d, then, although not free from doubt, BTG would also be treated as a PFIC as to\nsuch U.S. Holder with respect to the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the Initial Mergers, unless\nsuch U.S. Holder makes a purging election with respect to its shares, as described under \u201cMaterial Taxation\nConsiderations \u202f-\u202f Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations \u202f-\u202f Passive Foreign Investment Company\nRules.\u201d\n103 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn addition, if BSGA is or was a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owned BSGA\nRights, and assuming a QEF election is not available with respect to the BSGA Rights, the U.S. Holder may\nbe subject to the general PFIC rules with respect to the shares underlying the BSGA Rights, even if the U.S.\nHolder made a QEF election with respect to its other BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, unless a purging\nelection is made.\nIf BTG is (or is treated with respect to a U.S. Holder as) a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S.\nHolder owns BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, the U.S. Holder generally will be subject to adverse U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences, including increased tax liability on disposition gains and certain \u201cexcess\ndistributions\u201d and additional reporting requirements. Prospective U.S. Holders of BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the PFIC rules to BTG and the risks of\nowning equity securities in a company that may be a PFIC. See \u201cMaterial Taxation Considerations\u202f-\u202fMaterial\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u202f-\u202fPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules.\u201d\nBecause under certain attribution rules BTG\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries may be treated as controlled foreign\ncorporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there could be adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to\ncertain U.S. Holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares who own, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, each \u201cTen Percent Shareholder\u201d  (as defined below) in a non-U.S.\ncorporation that is classified as a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d  (a \u201cCFC\u201d) generally is required to include\nin income such Ten Percent Shareholder\u2019s pro rata share of the CFC\u2019s \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d investment of\nearnings in U.S. property, and \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d even if the CFC has made no\ndistributions to its shareholders. Subpart F income generally includes dividends, interest, rents, royalties,\ngains from the sale of securities and income from certain transactions with related parties, and \u201cglobal\nintangible low-taxed income\u201d generally consists of net income of the CFC, other than Subpart F income and\ncertain other types of income, in excess of certain thresholds. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be\nclassified as a CFC if Ten Percent Shareholders own, directly, indirectly or constructively (through\nattribution), more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote\nof such corporation or of the total value of the stock of such corporation. A \u201cTen Percent Shareholder\u201d is a\nUnited States person (as defined by the Code) who owns or is considered to own, directly, indirectly or\nconstructively, 10% or more of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote\nof such corporation or the total value of the stock of such corporation. The determination of CFC status is\ncomplex and includes certain \u201cdownward attribution\u201d rules pursuant to which BTG\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries\nmay be treated as constructively owned by BTG\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries and, therefore, BTG\u2019s non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries may be treated as CFCs. Prospective holders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that may be or\nbecome Ten Percent Shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the potential adverse tax\nconsequences of investing in BTG.\nFuture changes to tax laws could materially and adversely affect BTG and reduce net returns to BTG\u2019s\nshareholders.\nBTG\u2019s tax treatment is subject to changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation\nthereof, tax policy initiatives and reforms under consideration, and the practices of tax authorities in\njurisdictions in which BTG operates. The income and other tax rules in the jurisdictions in which BTG\noperates are constantly under review by taxing authorities and other governmental bodies. Changes to tax\nlaws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect BTG or its shareholders. BTG\nis unable to predict what tax proposals may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such\nchanges would have on BTG\u2019s business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax\nlegislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect BTG\u2019s financial position and overall or effective tax\nrates in the future in countries where BTG has operations and where BTG is organized or resident for tax\npurposes, and increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. BTG urges investors to consult\nwith their legal and tax advisers regarding the implication of potential changes in tax laws on an investment\nin BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\n104 \n",

As of the close of\nbusiness on March 20, 2023, there were 3,505,888 BSGA Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding and entitled\nto vote, of which 1,718,388 are Public Shares, 292,500 are BSGA Class A Shares held by the initial\n105 \u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshareholders, 57,500 are BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares held by Maxim Group LLC (representative of\nunderwriters in the IPO), and 1,437,500 are Founder Shares held by the initial shareholders. Each holder of\nBSGA Ordinary Shares is entitled to one vote per share on each Proposal. If your shares are held in \u201cstreet\nname,\u201d you should contact your broker, bank or another nominee to ensure that shares held beneficially by\nyou are voted in accordance with your instructions.\nIn connection with the IPO, BSGA entered into certain letter agreements pursuant to which the Initial\nShareholders agreed to vote any BSGA Ordinary Shares owned by them in favor of BSGA\u2019s initial business\ncombination. The Initial Shareholders also entered into a certain support agreement with Bitdeer, pursuant to\nwhich they agreed to, among other things, in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and the other\nProposals. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Initial Shareholders hold approximately\n49.3% of the outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares.\nQuorum and Required Vote for Shareholder Proposals\nA quorum of BSGA Shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present at the\nExtraordinary General Meeting if not less than 50 percent of the shares issued and outstanding BSGA\nOrdinary Shares and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting is present in person physically or\nby virtual attendance or represented by proxy.\nApproval of the Business Combination Proposal, the Initial Mergers Proposal, the Nasdaq Proposal, the\nGoverning Documents Proposal, the Governing Documents Proposals A to D, the BTG Incentive Plan\nProposal, and the Adjournment Proposal will each require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of\nthe issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual attendance or\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof.\nAttending the Extraordinary General Meeting either in person physically or by virtual attendance or\nrepresented by proxy and abstaining from voting and a broker non-vote will not have any effect on the\nProposals. An abstention or broker non-vote will be counted towards the quorum requirement but will not\ncount as a vote cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nThe approval of the Business Combination Proposal, the Initial Mergers Proposal, the Nasdaq Proposal,\nthe Governing Documents Proposal, the Governing Documents Proposals A to D, the BTG Incentive Plan\nProposal, and the Adjournment Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Merger. If the Business\nCombination Proposal is not approved, the Merger will not take place.\nVoting Your Shares\nEach BSGA Ordinary Share that you own in your name entitles you to one vote on each Proposal for the\nExtraordinary General Meeting. Your proxy card shows the number of ordinary shares that you own.\nThere are two ways to ensure that your ordinary shares are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting:\nYou can vote your shares by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the pre-paid\npostage envelope provided. If you submit your proxy card, your \u201cproxy,\u201d whose name is listed on the\nproxy card, will vote your shares as you instruct on the proxy card. If you sign and return the proxy\ncard but do not give instructions on how to vote your shares, your shares will be voted, as\nrecommended by our board. The BSGA Board recommends voting \u201cFOR\u201d each of the Proposals. If\nyou hold your ordinary shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d which means your shares are held of record by a\nbroker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided to you by your broker,\nbank or nominee to ensure that the votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly\nrepresented and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nYou can participate in the Extraordinary General Meeting and vote during the Extraordinary General\nMeeting even if you have previously voted by submitting a proxy as described above. However, if\nyour shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee, you must get a proxy from\nthe broker, bank or other nominee. That is the only way BSGA can be sure that the broker, bank or\nnominee has not already voted your shares.\n106 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nIF YOU RETURN YOUR PROXY CARD WITHOUT AN INDICATION OF HOW YOU WISH TO VOTE, YOUR\nSHARES WILL BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL (AS WELL AS THE\nOTHER PROPOSALS).\nRevoking Your Proxy\nIf you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by doing any one of the\nfollowing:\nyou may send another proxy card with a later date\u037e\nif you are a record holder, you may notify our proxy solicitor, Advantage in writing before the\nExtraordinary General Meeting that you have revoked your proxy\u037e or\nyou may participate in the virtual Meeting, revoke your proxy, and vote during the virtual Meeting, as\nindicated above.\nWho Can Answer Your Questions About Voting Your Shares\nIf you have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares, you may call\nSerena Shie at +852 9583 3199 or email at serena@firsteuro.co, or our proxy solicitor, Advantage at 1-877-870-\n8565 or email at ksmith@advantageproxy.com.\nNo Additional Matters May Be Presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting\nThis Meeting has been called only to consider the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, the\nInitial Mergers Proposal, the Nasdaq Proposal, the Governing Documents Proposal, the Governing\nDocuments Proposals A to D, the BTG Incentive Plan Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal. Approval of\nthese Proposals will each require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and\noutstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual attendance or represented by\nproxy and entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof.\nRedemption Rights\nPursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles, a holder of Public Shares may demand that BSGA redeem such\nshares for cash in connection with a business combination. You may not elect to redeem your shares prior to\nthe completion of a business combination.\nIf you are a public shareholder and you seek to have your shares redeemed, you must submit your\nrequest in writing that we redeem your public shares for cash no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on April 7,\n2023 (at least two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting). The request must be signed by\nthe applicable shareholder in order to validly request redemption. A shareholder is not required to submit a\nproxy card or vote in order to validly exercise redemption rights. The request must identify the holder of the\nshares to be redeemed and must be sent to Continental at the following address:\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company\n1 State Street, 30th floor \nNew York, NY 10004 \nAttention: Mark Zimkind \nEmail: mzimkind@continentalstock.com\nYou must tender the public shares for which you are electing redemption at least two business days\nbefore the Extraordinary General Meeting by either:\nDelivering certificates representing ordinary shares to Continental, or\nDelivering the ordinary shares electronically through the DWAC system.\nAny corrected or changed written demand of redemption rights must be received by Continental at least\ntwo business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting. No demand for redemption will be honored\nunless the holder\u2019s shares have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to Continental at least\ntwo business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n107 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAny demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising\nredemption requests (and submitting shares to the transfer agent) and thereafter, with our consent, until the\nvote is taken with respect to the Proposals. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent\nand decide within the required timeframe not to exercise your redemption rights, you may request that our\ntransfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our\ntransfer agent.\nPublic shareholders may seek to have their shares redeemed regardless of whether they vote for or\nagainst the Business Combination and whether or not they are holders of ordinary shares as of the Record\nDate or vote on any of the Proposals. Any public shareholder who holds shares of BSGA on or before April\n7, 2023 (at least two business days before the Extraordinary General Meeting) will have the right to demand\nthat his, her or its shares be redeemed for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the\nTrust Account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid, at the consummation of the Business Combination.\nIn connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you must elect either to physically tender\nyour share certificates to Continental or deliver your shares to Continental electronically using DTC\u2019s\nDWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, in each case, at least two business days before the\nExtraordinary General Meeting.\nIf you wish to tender through the DWAC system, please contact your broker and request delivery of\nyour shares through the DWAC system. Delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order\nto obtain a physical stock certificate, a shareholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and Continental\nwill need to act together to facilitate this request. It is BSGA\u2019s understanding that shareholders should\ngenerally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from Continental. BSGA does not have any\ncontrol over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a\nphysical stock certificate. Shareholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be\nunable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their Redemption Rights and thus\nwill be unable to redeem their shares.\nIn the event that a shareholder tenders its BSGA Ordinary Shares and decides prior to the\nconsummation of the Business Combination that it does not want to redeem its shares, the shareholder may\nwithdraw the tender. In the event that a shareholder tenders ordinary shares and the business combination is\nnot completed, these shares will not be redeemed for cash and the physical certificates representing these\nshares will be returned to the shareholder promptly following the determination that the Business\nCombination will not be consummated. BSGA anticipates that a shareholder who tenders ordinary shares for\nredemption in connection with the vote to approve the Business Combination would receive payment of the\nredemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Business Combination.\nIf properly demanded by BSGA\u2019s public shareholders, BSGA will redeem each share into a pro rata\nportion of the funds available in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the\nanticipated consummation of the Business Combination. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus,\nthis would amount to approximately US$10.87 per share. If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be\nexchanging your ordinary shares for cash and will no longer own the ordinary shares.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of the public shares, together with any affiliate of his or her or\nany other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d  (as defined in Section 13(d)-(3) of\nthe Exchange Act will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15%\nof the shares sold in IPO.\nIf too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, BSGA may not be able to meet certain\nclosing conditions, and as a result, would not be able to proceed with the Business Combination.\nAppraisal Rights\nUnder section 179 of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended), holders of BSGA Ordinary\nShares will have the right to dissent from the Business Combination. Should a holder of BSGA Ordinary\nShares wish to exercise their appraisal right, they must give written notice of their objection to the Business\nCombination to BSGA prior to the Special Meeting, or at the meeting but before the vote on the Business\n108 \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCombination. Such notice must include a statement that the BSGA shareholder proposes to demand payment\nfor their shares if the Business Combination is undertaken.\nAssuming that the Business Combination is approved, BSGA must give notice to any BSGA\nshareholder who gave written notice of their objection to the Business Combination within 20 days of the\ndate of the Special Meeting at which the Business Combination is approved. Within 20 days following the\ndate of receipt of that notice, the dissenting shareholder must give notice to BSGA of their election to\ndissent, which notice must include: (a) the shareholder\u2019s name and address\u037e (b) the number and class of\nshares in respect of which they dissent (which must be all of the shares that the shareholder holds in BSGA)\u037e\nand (c) a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares. Once such notice has been given to BSGA, the\ndissenting shareholder ceases to have any rights as a shareholder of BSGA except for the right to be paid\nthe fair value of their shares.\nWithin seven days of the expiration of the 20-day period in which a BSGA shareholder may serve notice\nof dissent (or seven days following the First SPAC Merger, whichever is the later), BSGA shall make a written\noffer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase their shares at a specified price that BSGA determine to be\ntheir fair value. If, within 30 days of the date on which that offer is made, BSGA and the dissenting\nshareholder agree upon the price to be paid for the shares, BSGA shall pay that amount to the shareholder\nupon the surrender of the certificates representing their shares.\nIf agreement on the price to be paid for the shares cannot be reached, within 20 days of the expiration of\nthe 30-day period referred to above the following procedure shall be followed:\nBSGA and the dissenting shareholder shall each designate an appraiser\u037e\nthe two designated appraisers together shall designate an appraiser\u037e\nthe three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholder as of\nthe close of business on the day prior to the date on which the Business Combination was\napproved, excluding any appreciation or depreciation directly or indirectly induced by the Business\nCombination or its proposal, and that value is binding on BSGA and the dissenting shareholder for\nall purposes\u037e and\nBSGA shall pay to the dissenting shareholder that amount in money, upon the surrender of the\ncertificates representing their shares.\nProxies and Proxy Solicitation Costs\nBSGA is soliciting proxies on behalf of the BSGA Board. This solicitation is being made by mail but also\nmay be made by telephone or in person. BSGA and its directors, officers and employees may also solicit\nproxies in person, by telephone or by other electronic means. Any solicitation made and information\nprovided in such a solicitation will be consistent with the written proxy statement/prospectus and proxy\ncard. BSGA will bear the cost of solicitation. Advantage, a proxy solicitation firm that BSGA has engaged to\nassist it in soliciting proxies, will be paid its customary fee of approximately US$10,000 and be reimbursed\nout-of-pocket expenses.\nBSGA will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward its proxy\nmaterials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions. BSGA\nwill reimburse them for their reasonable expenses.\n109 \n",

The following unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of\nRegulation S-X.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial position as of June 30,\n2022 combines the historical unaudited condensed balance sheet of BSGA as of June 30, 2022 with the\nhistorical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of financial position of Bitdeer as June 30, 2022,\ngiving pro forma effect to the Business Combination, as if they had occurred as of June 30, 2022.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 combine the historical unaudited condensed statement of operations of BSGA for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, and the historical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations\nof Bitdeer for the six months ended June 30, 2022, giving pro forma effect to the Business Combination as if\nthey had occurred on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 combine the historical statement of operations of BSGA for the period from February 23,\n2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the historical combined and consolidated statement of\noperations of Bitdeer for year ended December 31, 2021, giving pro forma effect to the Business Combination\nas if they had occurred on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nThis information should be read together with the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements of\nBitdeer and its related notes and BSGA\u2019s financial statements and related notes, \u201cBitdeer Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cBSGA Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and other financial information\nincluded elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nDescription of the Business Combination\nOn December 15, 2021, the BSGA Board signed a unanimous written resolution approving the Merger\nAgreement by and among BTG, Bitdeer, BSGA, BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger Sub 2, Bitdeer Merger\nSub, and BSGA Sub, amending and restating the agreement and plan of merger dated November 18, 2021, by\nand among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub, pursuant to which (i) BSGA Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into\nBSGA, with BSGA being the surviving entity (the \u201cFirst SPAC Merger\u201d), (ii) following the First SPAC Merger,\nBSGA will merge with and into BSGA Merger Sub 2, with BSGA Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the\n\u201cSecond SPAC Merger\u201d, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the \u201cInitial Mergers\u201d), and (iii) following\nthe Initial Mergers, Bitdeer Merger Sub will merge with and into Bitdeer (the \u201cAcquisition Merger\u201d, and\ntogether with the Initial Mergers, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.\nAccounting for the Business Combination\nThe Business Combination will be accounted for as a \u201creverse recapitalization\u201d in accordance with\nIFRS. Under this method of accounting, BSGA will be treated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company for financial\nreporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business\nCombination, the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders are expected to have a majority of the voting power of BTG, Bitdeer\nwill comprise all of the ongoing operations of combined company, Bitdeer will comprise a majority of the\ngoverning body of combined company, and Bitdeer's senior management will comprise all of the senior\nmanagement of the combined company. Since BSGA does not meet the definition of a business under IFRS,\nthe transaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, and it is accounted for as an\nequity-settled, share-based payment transaction in accordance with IFRS 2, \u201cShare-based Payments\u201d.\nAccordingly, for accounting\n110 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npurposes, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of Bitdeer issuing shares for the net\nassets of BSGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BSGA will be stated at historical costs.\nAny difference in the fair value of the consideration deemed to have been issued by Bitdeer and the fair\nvalue of BSGA\u2019s identifiable net assets represents a listing service received by Bitdeer and is recorded\nthrough profit and loss. No goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. Operations prior to the\nBusiness Combination will be those of Bitdeer.\nBasis of Pro Forma Presentation\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus\nhas been prepared using the assumptions below with respect to the potential redemption into cash of\nBSGA\u2019s Class A Ordinary Shares:\nScenario 1\u202f-\u202fAssuming No Redemptions: This presentation assumes that no Public Shareholders\nexercise Redemption Rights with respect to their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for a pro rata share of\nthe funds in BSGA\u2019s Trust Account.\nScenario 2\u202f-\u202fAssuming Maximum Redemptions:\u2007\u2007This presentation assumes that BSGA\u2019s Public\nShareholders exercise their Redemption Rights with respect to a maximum of 1,718,388 BSGA Class A\nOrdinary Shares upon consummation of the Business Combination at a redemption price of\napproximately US$10.84 per share. Scenario 2 includes all adjustments contained in Scenario 1 and\npresents additional adjustments to reflect the effect of the maximum redemptions.\nThe foregoing scenarios are for illustrative purposes only as the actual number of redemptions by\nBSGA\u2019s public shareholders is unknowable prior to the BSGA Shareholder vote with respect to the Business\nCombination. Accordingly, the actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly\nfrom the pro forma amounts presented herein.\nIncluded below is the expected number of shares to be issued, and the related ownership interests, at\nthe completion of the transaction under the two scenarios:\nScenario 1 \nPro Forma Combined\n(Assuming \nNo Redemptions)\nScenario 2 \nPro Forma Combined \n(Assuming Maximum \nRedemptions)\nOwnership\nin \nshares\nOwnership\n%\nOwnership\nin \nshares\nOwnership\n%\nBSGA Public Shareholders\n2,293,388\n2.0\n575,000\n0.5\nBSGA Sponsor, current directors, officers and\naffiliates, and representative shares\n1,816,750\n1.6\n1,816,750\n1.6\nBitdeer Shareholders\n108,758,873\n96.4\n108,758,873\n97.9\nTotal\n112,869,011\n100.0\n111,150,623\n100.0\nIncluding one right to receive one-tenth of one BTG Shares upon consummation of the Business\nCombination.\nIncluding 57,500 representative shares issued at IPO as compensation for their services.\nIncluding Bitdeer Preference Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Business Combination on an\nas-converted basis and excluding Bitdeer RSUs and Bitdeer Convertible Note outstanding prior to the\nBusiness Combination. Bitdeer has 601,203,820 vested and exercisable RSUs, equivalent to 5,163,924\nBTG Ordinary Shares that will be available for issuance under the Bitdeer Plan prior to the Business\nCombination.\nThe share amounts and ownership percentages set forth above are not indicative of voting percentages.\nShareholders will experience additional dilution to the extent BTG issues additional shares after the\nClosing. The table above excludes (a) up to 4,077,203 BTG Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon\nconversion of US$30,000,000 principal amount of the Bitdeer Convertible Note and (b) up to 21,893,567\n111 \n(1)\n%\n%\n (2)\n%\n%\n(3)\n%\n%\n%\n%\n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBTG Ordinary Shares that will be available for issuance under the Bitdeer Plan, which will be equal to\n2,548,933,157 shares multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

As the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared\nbased on these preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded may differ materially from the information\npresented.\nThe pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Business Combination are based on\ninformation available as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and certain assumptions and\nmethodologies that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited condensed\npro forma adjustments, which are described in the accompanying notes, may be revised as additional\ninformation becomes available and is evaluated. Therefore, the actual adjustments may materially differ from\nthe pro forma adjustments. Management considers this basis of presentation to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not necessarily indicative of\nwhat the actual results of operations and financial position would have been had the Business Combination\ntaken place on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of operations or\nfinancial position of the post-combination company. They should be read in conjunction with the historical\nfinancial statements and notes thereto of Bitdeer and BSGA.\nNote 2\u202f-\u202fIFRS Policy and Presentation Alignment\nThe historical financial information of BSGA has been adjusted to give effect to the differences between\nUS GAAP and IFRS for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\nThe only adjustment required to convert BSGA\u2019s financial statements from U.S. to IFRS for purposes of the\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was to reclassify BSGA\u2019s ordinary shares\nsubject to redemption to other liabilities under IFRS.\nFurther, as part of the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\ninformation, certain reclassifications were made to align BSGA\u2019s historical financial information in\naccordance with the presentation of Bitdeer\u2019s historical financial information.\nNote 3\u202f-\u202fAdjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared to illustrate the\neffect of the Business Combination and has been prepared for informational purposes only.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in\naccordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786\n\u201cAmendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.\u201d Release No. 33-10786\nreplaces the existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for\nthe transaction (\u201cTransaction Accounting Adjustments\u201d) and present the reasonably estimable synergies\nand other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (\u201cManagement\u2019s\nAdjustments\u201d). Bitdeer has elected not to present Management\u2019s Adjustments and will only be presenting\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments in the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial\ninformation.\nBitdeer and BSGA have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination other than\nitem as described in (I) below. Accordingly, such transaction accounting adjustments were required to\neliminate activities between the companies.\nTransaction Accounting Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Financial\nPosition\nThe transaction accounting adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nstatement of financial position as of June 30, 2022 are as follows:\nReflects the interest income earned from July 1, 2022 to December 7, 2022, which increased the\nredemption value of the Class A ordinary shares from US$10.20 per share to US$10.42 per share\u037e\n118 \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(A) \n(B) \n(C) \n(D) \n(E) \n(F) \n(G) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nReflects the redemption of 4,031,612 Class A ordinary shares at redemption value of US$10.42 per\nshare\u037e\nReflects the interest income earned from December 8, 2022 to February 28, 2023, which increased\nthe redemption value of the Class A ordinary shares from US$10.42 per share to US$10.54 per share\u037e\nReflects the two US$257,758 non-interest bearing loans from Bitdeer and deposited into the trust\naccount in order to extend the available time to complete the Business Combination, which\nincreased the redemption value of the 1,718,388 Class A ordinary shares from US$10.54 per share to\nUS$10.84 per share\u037e\nReflects the reclassification of cash held in the Trust Account that becomes available for general\nuse following the Business Combination\u037e\nReflects the reclassification of 1,718,388 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to\npermanent equity at US$0.0000001 par value, the reclassification of 1,437,500 Founder Shares from\nClass B Ordinary Shares to Class A Ordinary Shares, the issuance of 604,250 shares of Class A\nordinary shares from the conversion of 6,042,500 rights upon consummation of a Business\nCombination, and the reclassification of 350,000 BSGA\u2019s Class A ordinary shares into BTG\u2019s Class\nA ordinary shares at US$0.0000001 par value\u037e\nReflects the settlement of approximately US$2.0 million deferred underwriters discount that become\ndue and payable upon consummation of a Business Combination\u037e\nReflects the settlement of approximately US$8.8 million of Bitdeer\u2019s deferred transaction costs\nrelated to the Business Combination, of which, 1) approximately US$0.4 million of transaction costs\naccrued as of the balance sheet date and 2) approximately US$8.4 million subsequently reclassify to\nreserves upon the close of the Business Combination\u037e\nReflects the recapitalization of Bitdeer\u2019s equity as consideration for the reverse recapitalization\nwith 1) issuance of 48.4 million Class V ordinary shares and 2) issuance of 60.3 million Class A\nordinary shares\u037e\nReflects the elimination of BSGA\u2019s historical accumulated deficit\u037e\nReflects the preliminary estimated expense recognized, in accordance with IFRS 2, for the excess of\nthe fair value of BSGA\u2019s ordinary shares issued over the fair value of BSGA\u2019s identifiable net assets\nat the date of the Business Combination, resulting in US$32.8 million and US$33.2 million decrease\nto retained earnings assuming no redemptions and maximum redemptions, respectively.\nAssuming No \nRedemptions\nAssuming \nMaximum \nRedemptions\nTotal BSGA\u2019s ordinary shares outstanding\n4,110,138\n2,391,750\nFair value of shares as of March 2, 2023\nUS$\n10.65\nUS$\n10.65\nEstimated market value of shares (in thousands)\nUS$\n43,773\nUS$\n25,472\nPro forma net assets of BSGA as of June 30, 2022\nUS$\n12,036\nUS$\n12,036\nLess: Effect of maximum redemption of 1,718,388 BSGA\u2019s\nClass A ordinary shares\n-\n(18,621\nLess: BSGA\u2019s transaction costs\n(1,100\n(1,100\nAdjusted pro forma net assets (liabilities) of BSGA as of June\n30, 2022\n10,936\n(7,685\nDifference\u202f-\u202fbeing IFRS 2 charge for listing services\nUS$\n32,837\nUS$\n33,157\nThe net assets of BSGA have been reduced by the expected transaction costs to be paid by BSGA\nand are reflected as a reduction to cash in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement\nof financial position.

These costs are a\nnonrecurring item.\nNote 4\u202f-\u202fEarnings/(Loss) per Share\nRepresents the earnings/(loss) per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) calculated using the historical weighted average\nshares outstanding, and the change in number of shares in connection with the Business Combination,\nassuming the shares were outstanding at the beginning of the period presented. As the Business\nCombination and related transactions are being reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the\nperiod presented, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted\nearnings/(loss) per share assumes that the shares issuable relating to the Business Combination have been\noutstanding for the entire period presented.\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share is computed by dividing pro forma profit/(loss) for the periods by the\nweighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods using the two class method.\nUsing the two class method, net profit/(loss) for the periods are allocated between Class A ordinary shares,\nClass V ordinary shares and other participating securities (i.e. preference shares) based on their participating\nrights. Except for voting rights, the Class A and Class V ordinary shares have all the same rights and\ntherefore the pro forma earnings/(loss) per share for both classes of shares are identical. The pro forma\nearnings/(loss) per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class V ordinary shares because the holders\nof each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation.\n120 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming no\nredemptions and assuming maximum redemptions, for the six months ended June 30, 2022:\nFor the Six Months Ended \nJune 30, 2022\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCombined \n(Assuming No \nRedemptions)\nCombined \n(Assuming \nMaximum \nRedemptions)\nPro forma net loss\nUS$\n(28,141\nUS$\n(28,141\nWeighted average shares outstanding\u202f-\u202fbasic and diluted\n112,869,011\n111,150,623\nLoss per share\u202f-\u202fbasic and diluted\nUS$\n(0.25\nUS$\n(0.25\nWeighted average shares calculation, basic and diluted\nClass A Ordinary Shares\nBSGA public shares\n1,718,388\n-\nBSGA shares converted from rights\n604,250\n604,250\nBSGA Sponsor and private shares\n1,730,000\n1,730,000\nBSGA issued to underwriter\n57,500\n57,500\nBSGA issued in the Business Combination\n60,324,319\n60,324,319\nSubtotal\u202f-\u202fClass A Ordinary Shares\n64,434,457\n62,716,069\nClass V Ordinary Shares\nBSGA issued in the Business Combination\n48,434,554\n48,434,554\nTotal weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS\n112,869,011\n111,150,623\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming no\nredemptions and assuming maximum redemptions, for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nFor the Year Ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCombined \n(Assuming No \nRedemptions)\nCombined \n(Assuming \nMaximum \nRedemptions)\nPro forma net income\nUS$\n60,668\nUS$\n60,466\nWeighted average shares outstanding\u202f-\u202fbasic\n112,869,011\n111,150,623\nEarnings per share - basic\nUS$\n0.54\nUS$\n0.54\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n115,575,085\n113,856,697\nEarnings per share - diluted\nUS$\n0.52\nUS$\n0.53\nWeighted average shares calculation, basic and diluted\nClass A Ordinary Shares\nBSGA public shares\n1,718,388\n-\nBSGA shares converted from rights\n604,250\n604,250\nBSGA Sponsor and private shares\n1,730,000\n1,730,000\nBSGA issued to underwriter\n57,500\n57,500\nBSGA issued in the Business Combination\n60,324,319\n60,324,319\nSubtotal\u202f-\u202fClass A Ordinary Shares\n64,434,457\n62,716,069\nClass V Ordinary Shares\nBSGA issued in the Business Combination\n48,434,554\n48,434,554\nTotal weighted average shares outstanding for basic EPS\n112,869,011\n111,150,623\nAdjusted for:\nAssumed conversion of convertible debt\n1,809,608\n1,809,608\nAssumed exercise of share awards\n896,466\n896,466\nTotal weighted average shares outstanding for diluted EPS\n115,575,085\n113,856,697\n121 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n",

BSGA Dissenting Shares owned by such BSGA Shareholders, and\n(iii) the one share of BTG that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC\nMerger will be redeemed for an

of the Business Combination\nAs described above and contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination will be\nconsummated via a multiple-merger structure (also known as \u201cdouble dummy\u201d), consisting of the Initial\nMergers and the Acquisition Merger. Under such structure, each of BSGA and Bitdeer will merge with a\nsubsidiary of BTG, a newly formed company, through the Initial Mergers and the Acquisition Merger,\nrespectively. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will be the public company listed\n124 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\non Nasdaq. The multiple-merger structure was chosen by the parties to the Merger Agreement for business,\nlegal and accounting reasons. In particular, given BTG\u2019s eligibility as a foreign private issuer, its reporting\nobligations under U.S. securities laws will be less burdensome compared to domestic registrants and BTG\nwill be able to prepare and file its financial statements in accordance with the International Financial\nReporting Standards. Such benefit will not be available immediately upon Closing if the Business\nCombination were to be conducted through a reverse triangular merger in which Bitdeer would be acquired\ndirectly by BSGA, which would continue to report as a domestic registrant upon Closing until further\nassessment of factors such as its shareholder base and location of assets at a future date pursuant to U.S.\nsecurities laws. Operationally, following the Business Combination conducted via the proposed structure,\nBTG will be a holding company that will operate Bitdeer\u2019s current business through its subsidiaries, which is\nconsistent with the expectations of Bitdeer and BSGA\u2019s management in relation to post-Business\nCombination corporate and operational structure.\nIn addition, the Initial Mergers are structured as two separate mergers primarily for U.S. tax reasons. The\nexchange of BSGA Securities (as defined in \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d) for BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Business Combination is intended to qualify as a tax-free\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsiderations - Consequences of the Business Combination - Qualification of the Initial Mergers as a\nReorganization.\u201d The Initial Mergers that effect the exchange of BSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares are structured as a two-step merger in the form of the First SPAC Merger and the Second SPAC\nMerger to reduce the risk that holders will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the exchange of their\nBSGA Securities for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by Bitdeer to BSGA relating to a\nnumber of matters, including, among other aspects, corporate organization, qualification to do business,\ngood standing and corporate power, requisite corporate authority to enter into the Merger Agreement and to\ncomplete the contemplated transactions, absence of conflicts, required governmental and regulatory\nconsents , capitalization of Bitdeer and its subsidiaries and financial statement.\nThe Merger Agreement also contains representations and warranties made by BSGA Parties to Bitdeer\nrelating to a number of matters, including, among other aspects, corporate organization, qualification to do\nbusiness, good standing and corporate power, requisite corporate authority to enter into the Merger\nAgreement and to complete the contemplated transactions, absence of conflicts with governing documents,\napplicable laws or certain agreements and instruments as a result of entering into the Merger Agreement or\nconsummate the Business Combination, required governmental and regulatory consents necessary in\nconnection with the Business Combination, the Nasdaq quotation, and proxy statement/registration\nstatement.\nThis summary and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as\nAnnex A-1, Annex A-2 , Annex A-3 and Annex A-4 are included solely to provide investors with information\nregarding the terms of the Merger Agreement.

BSGA\u2019s representatives contacted and were\ncontacted by a number of individuals and entities who offered to present ideas and opportunities for a\nbusiness combination, including financial advisors and companies that have their operations in either the\nUnited States or Asia. BSGA compiled a list of potential targets and updated and supplemented such list\nfrom time to time. Such list was periodically shared with the BSGA Board.\nDuring the search period, BSGA and its representatives:\nIdentified and evaluated approximately 15 potential target companies (other than Bitdeer) across a\nrange of sectors including but not limited to luxury, technology, biotech, education, blockchain\nenabled services and fintech\u037e\nAmong the companies it had evaluated, BSGA executed non-disclosure agreements with\napproximately 5 potential targets businesses or their representatives (other than Bitdeer) in order to\nreceive further detailed information about these potential targets\u037e\nBSGA\u2019s representative, management and/or the board engaged in discussions directly with the senior\nexecutives and/or representatives of approximately 5 alternative potential targets (other than Bitdeer)\u037e\nand\nAmong the potential targets, BSGA executed a letter of intent and entered into substantive\nnegotiations and due diligence with two potential target businesses (including Bitdeer).\nFrom around June 15, 2021, BSGA\u2019s management and board were introduced to various potential\nacquisition targets by BSGA\u2019s advisors and contacts of BSGA\u2019s management and board that might\npotentially meet the BSGA management team\u2019s preliminary target selection criteria. BSGA\u2019s management and\nboard reviewed, among others, the financial performance, management team, industry and a description of\neach potential candidate. Following such initial review, BSGA\u2019s search team selected preliminarily qualified\ncandidates and continued with second stage review by conducting conference calls and collecting more\ndetailed business information of the candidates.\nFrom June 2021 to July 2021, and again from September 2021 to October 2021, BSGA held a number of\ninternal meetings to discuss preliminary candidates. At each meeting, BSGA reviewed and discussed the\nqualifications of those candidates. In reviewing approximately 15 potential targets (excluding Bitdeer) from\ntime to time, and holding discussions with their respective management, BSGA focused on three other\npotential companies before BSGA identified Bitdeer as a preferred acquisition target.\nCompany A: On or around June 19, 2021, Company A, which is not affiliated with BSGA or to any\naffiliated business entities of BSGA, was referred to BSGA\u2019s team through a financial advisor for Company A.\nCompany A is a global camera developer and manufacturer. On July 5, 2021, after reviewing basic information\nof Company A, BSGA\u2019s management and board determined to proceed the discussion with Company A\ndiligence questions for a potential merger. At the end of July 2021, BSGA decided not to proceed with\nCompany A because BSGA decided to focus on its target industry of fintech, infotech and business services\nand concurrently, Company A decided to pursue alternative funding strategies.\n130 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany B: On June 24, 2021, Company B, which is not affiliated with BSGA or any affiliated business\nentities, was referred to BSGA\u2019s search team. Company B is a crypto mining company with operations in\nCanada and the United States. On July 17, 2021, after reviewing information of Company B and holding\nmeetings with Company B\u2019s management, BSGA\u2019s management and board decided to proceed with Company\nB as a potential merger candidate. On July 22, 2021, BSGA entered into a letter of intent with Company B.\nFrom July 2021 through September 2021, BSGA\u2019s representatives visited Company B\u2019s office, conducted\nfinancial and legal diligence and reviewed Company B\u2019s financial information, management structure and\nbusiness model. BSGA team had detailed negotiations regarding the merger agreement, lockup and ancillary\nterms. The BSGA board passed a board resolution on August 23, 2021, in preparation to enter into a\ndefinitive merger agreement with Company B. However, at the end of September 2021, BSGA and Company B\ndecided not to move forward with the business combination due to changes in Company B\u2019s business\noperations and the expiration of exclusivity.\nCompany C: On June 24, 2021, Company C, which is not affiliated with BSGA or any of its affiliated\nbusiness entities, was referred to BSGA\u2019s management team. Company C is a leading crypto exchange\nplatform in South-east Asia. On around July 8, 2021, after reviewing basic information of Company C, BSGA\u2019s\nmanagement team proceeded to discuss with Company C diligence questions for a potential merger. BSGA\u2019s\nmanagement team had multiple meetings with representatives and senior management of Company C. At the\nend of July 2021, BSGA ceased its discussion with Company C because Company C decided to explore a\ntraditional initial public offering and alternative funding strategies.\nIn respect to other alternative potential targets, the reasons that discussions did not continue included\n(1) a difference in valuation expectations, sometimes driven by competitive sale side auction, (2) the BSGA\nmanagement and board\u2019s belief that the alternative potential target is less attractive than Bitdeer with respect\nto factors such as competitive positioning, management experience and hash rate, (3) geopolitical risks\nassociated with the target\u2019s business and (4) the stage of the potential target company\u2019s business making\ncertain targets unsuitable to becoming publicly listed companies in the next 12 months.\nTimeline of the Business Combination\nIn April 2021, Bitdeer and a prior special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of\nBSGA (\u201cSPAC I\u201d), were introduced to each other. SPAC I reviewed preliminary materials regarding Bitdeer.\nThe parties did not move forward with entering into a business combination as it became clear to Bitdeer and\nSPAC I that Bitdeer would need more time to communicate with its shareholders and obtain their consent to\nthe proposed business combination, and that a proposed transaction could not have been consummated\nwithin the expected timeline of SPAC I for consummating its initial business combination. Thereafter, SPAC I\nexecuted an exclusive Letter of Intent with another target business on May 28, 2021 at which time it ceased\ndiscussions with other potential target businesses, including Bitdeer.\nOn June 24, 2021, BSGA\u2019s management team requested a member of the Sponsor and representative of\nBSGA to approach Bitdeer to discuss a potential business combination.\nOne June 25, 2021, Bitdeer provided BSGA with presentation materials introducing its business. On the\nsame day and over the next few days, BSGA\u2019s management team reviewed those material and had a general\nunderstanding of Bitdeer\u2019s operations, business model, key metrics and investment highlights. BSGA\u2019s\nmanagement and board discussed a potential business combination with Bitdeer, and whether such\ntransaction was compatible with BSGA\u2019s timeline for completing a business combination.\nOn June 29, 2021, BSGA and Bitdeer held their first in-depth discussion, which was attended by\nBitdeer\u2019s senior management and BSGA\u2019s board and management team. The parties discussed Bitdeer\u2019s\nbusiness model, growth, history, suppliers, management team background, as well as commercial and capital-\nraising plans.

During such\ndiscussions, BSGA\u2019s management team discussed with IJW about IJW\u2019s experience in crypto asset\ntransactions and in rendering fairness opinions as well as the general background of the IJW team and their\nvaluation experience.\nDuring the week of February 20, 2023, BSGA\u2019s management team further discussed with IJW about the\nfairness opinion work stream and also updated the BSGA Board on such work stream.\nIn late February 2023, BSGA\u2019s management team also briefed the BSGA Board on IJW\u2019s background and\nexperience, especially its experience in crypto asset transactions and experience in rendering fairness\nopinions for mergers and acquisitions.\nOn February 24 and 25, 2023, BSGA and Bitdeer discussed updates to valuation and the development in\ncrypto market as well as whether to use projections of Bitdeer for the valuation analysis. During such\ndiscussions, both parties considered the volatility of the market and the inherent uncertainties involved in\nprojections. Based on these discussions, the parties agreed to use key selected financial information of\nBitdeer based on the unaudited management accounts of Bitdeer for the year ended December 31, 2022 and\nother internally prepared financials and certain key financial information of Bitdeer as of January 31, 2023\n(the \u201cSelected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer\u201d) and hash rate as of January 31, 2023 as part of\nthe basis for the updated valuation analysis and not to rely on financial projections for updating the\nvaluation. As a result, Bitdeer did not prepare updated financial projections.\nOn February 25, 2023, Bitdeer provided BSGA with the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of\nBitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023.

In particular, they considered that given the\ncurrent volatile market environment, financial indicators, such as revenue and EBITDA, have become\nincreasingly important in determining the viability and strength of a crypto company. In addition, the parties\nconsidered the changes in a few key parameters that contributed to the change in the discount for a lack of\nmarketability since BSGA\u2019s original valuation of Bitdeer, including the progress in listing timeline, and\nchanges in market volatility and risk-free rate. Based on these discussions, Bitdeer and BSGA reached a\npreliminary agreement on an updated valuation of US$1.18 billion, subject to respective final internal\napproval from each party.\nFrom February 27, 2023 to March 1, 2023, the BSGA Board met internally and also held a telephone\nconference with IJW to discuss the methodologies and factors being considered for the fairness opinion for\nthe Business Combination.\n135 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFrom February 25, 2023 to March 4, 2023, Royson reviewed documents in the virtual data room, as\nfurther supplemented from information request lists, and attended multiple due diligence meetings with\nBitdeer and BSGA over video conference.

See the section entitled \u201c- Fairness Opinion\nof BSGA\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d\nOn March 7, 2023, upon review of the Third Amendment, Mr. Jihan Wu, the sole director of Bitdeer,\napproved and entered into the Third Amendment on behalf of Bitdeer.\nOn March 7, 2023, BSGA, Bitdeer and the other parties to the Merger Agreement entered into the Third\nAmendment.\nBSGA Board\u2019s Review of Valuation\nBefore reaching its overall decision to approve and declare advisable the Merger Agreement, the BSGA\nBoard reviewed the proposed equity value of Bitdeer and considerations to be paid in connection with the\nBusiness Combination. In connection with such review, the BSGA Board reviewed a number of analysis,\nincluding (a) the analysis and opinion of Royson, BSGA\u2019s valuation advisor, as to the equity value of\nBitdeer, (b) review by an international accounting firm of the valuation performed by Royson, (c) audited and\nunaudited historical financial information of Bitdeer and (d) fairness opinion of IJW, BSGA\u2019s financial\nadvisor. The details of each such analysis and the engagement and qualifications of BSGA\u2019s valuation and\nfinancial advisors are set forth below. In particular, based on its review of each of these analyses and\ndiscussions with BSGA\u2019s management team and advisors regarding Bitdeer\u2019s equity value, the BSGA Board\ncame to the conclusion that the revised equity value of Bitdeer at US$1.18 billion from the initial US$4.0\nbillion is reflective of recent market developments in the crypto assets space. In addition, the revised\nvaluation better serves the interest of BSGA\u2019s public shareholders primarily considering that, pursuant to the\nterms of the Merger Agreement, as amended, reflecting such revised valuation, BSGA\u2019s public shareholders\nare anticipated to own a higher percentage of the outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares upon consummation of\nthe Business Combination. For details, please see the sections entitled \u201cQuestions and Answers about the\nProposals\u202f-\u202fQ: What equity stake will current BSGA Shareholders and Bitdeer securities holders hold in BTG\nimmediately after the consummation of the Business Combination?\u201d and \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed\nCombined Financial Information.\u201d The analysis of BSGA\u2019s management and advisors in support of the\nrevised valuation has taken into consideration the financial parameters of comparable companies and other\ninformation as of a more recent date, comparing to the analysis reviewed by the BSGA Board when\ndiscussing the original valuation of Bitdeer.\n136 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdditionally, prior to approving the Original Merger Agreement in November 2021 and the Amended\nand Restated Merger Agreement in December 2021, the BSGA Board reviewed certain financial projections of\nBitdeer. However, in connection with its review and approval of the updated valuation in 2023 and related\nterms of the Third Amendment, the BSGA Board did not rely on such projections, which are outdated, nor\ndid the BSGA Board receive any updated projections from Bitdeer, because the BSGA Board is of the view\nthat there are inherent uncertainties in relation to financial projections and, as described above, the analysis\nof Royson, the international accounting firm and IJW along with the historical financial information of\nBitdeer served as alternative sources for the BSGA Board to review the equity value of Bitdeer and\nconsiderations to be paid in connection with the proposed Business Combination.\nReports of Valuation Advisor to BSGA\nEngagement of Valuation Advisor to BSGA\nBSGA retained Royson to provide to the Board with an opinion regarding the valuation of Bitdeer.\nBSGA also retained the Audit Firm to further review Royson\u2019s work product regarding the reasonableness of\nthe methodologies as well as the results thereof. Royson provided BSGA with the Original Valuation Report,\nthe Updated Valuation Report and the 2023 Valuation Report, which were reviewed by the Audit Firm.\nIn selecting Royson, BSGA considered, among other things, the fact Royson, as part of its services, is\nfrequently engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and\nacquisitions. Neither Bitdeer nor BSGA had previously engaged Royson or any of its affiliates or unaffiliated\nrepresentatives for any matters other than the engagement by an affiliates of the Sponsor for valuation\nservices in connection with an unrelated transaction. Royson received a non-contingent fixed fee of\nUS$220,000 as compensation for the delivery of its valuation opinions in connection with the proposed\nBusiness Combination. Payment of the opinion fee to Royson is not dependent upon completion of the\nBusiness Combination or the findings of Royson with respect to valuation.\nIn selecting the Audit Firm, BSGA considered, among other things, that the Audit Firm has a reputable\ninternational presence with substantial experience advising companies on valuation and related matters. The\nAudit Firm, as part of its business, is frequently and continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses\nand their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and valuations for\ncorporate and other purposes. Neither BSGA nor Bitdeer had previously engaged the Audit Firm or any of its\naffiliates or unaffiliated representatives for any matters and had no prior relationship with the Audit Firm\nother than the engagement by an affiliate of the Sponsor for valuation services in connection with an\nunrelated transaction. BSGA paid the Audit Firm a non-contingent fixed fee of US$90,000 as compensation\nfor the review of Royson\u2019s opinions in connection with the proposed Business Combination.\nNeither Royson nor the Audit Firm received instructions from BSGA, Bitdeer or any of their respective\naffiliates. BSGA, Bitdeer and their respective affiliates did not impose any limitation on the scope of\nRoyson\u2019s or the Audit Firm\u2019s investigations of Bitdeer\u2019s value.\nReports of BSGA\u2019s Valuation Advisor\nRoyson rendered its valuation reports dated November 17, 2021, December 14, 2021 and March 7, 2023\nto BSGA on the fair market value of a 100% non-controlling equity interest of Bitdeer as of September 30,\n2021, December 13, 2021 and February 17, 2023 (\u201cFinal Appraisal Date\u201d), respectively, based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein.\nIn connection with rendering each of its valuation reports to the BSGA Board, Royson performed a\nnumber of processes and procedures, including the following:\nCollected and analyzed the relevant historical financial statements and other financial and operational\ninformation of Bitdeer received from Bitdeer\u2019s management (the \u201cManagement\u201d)\u037e\nConducted interviews with Bitdeer\u2019s management in relation to Bitdeer\u2019s history, operations, and\nprospects of its business\u037e\nResearched the general economic outlook and the outlook for the specific industry affecting the\nbusiness of Bitdeer, its industry and its markets\u037e\n137 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExamined the reasonableness of the information as well as other records and documents provided by\nthe Management, in light of their research and analysis on the industry and economic data\u037e\nDetermined the most appropriate valuation method for the valuation\u037e\nIdentified the comparable companies of Bitdeer\u037e\nDeveloped the appropriate discount rate that reflects the return of entities engaged in a similar line of\nbusiness and returns from other similar types of projects of Bitdeer\u037e\nEvaluated the business enterprise value of Bitdeer based on the assumptions and valuation methods\nstated in the report\u037e and\nConsulted, reviewed and replied on certain discussions with representatives of BSGA and Bitdeer and\ncertain parties and their financial and legal advisors.\nThe opinion of value provided by Royson is based on generally accepted valuation procedures and\npractices that rely extensively on the use of numerous assumptions and the consideration of many\nuncertainties, not all of which can be easily quantified or ascertained. Any variation to the assumptions and\nlimiting conditions presented in the following report could seriously affect Royson\u2019s opinion of value.\nRoyson has not audited, reviewed, or compiled the financial information provided to them and, accordingly,\nRoyson expresses no audit opinion or any other form of assurance on this information.\nIn addition, in arriving at its opinion, Royson assumed as relied, with BSGA\u2019s consent, on the following\ncontingent and limiting conditions: (i) public, industry, statistical, and other information furnished by others,\nupon which all or portions of this analysis is based is reliable, (ii) the information supplied by Management\nwas complete and accurate to the best of the Management\u2019s knowledge and that the financial statement\ninformation reflects the results of operations and financial and business condition of Bitdeer was in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, unless otherwise noted, (iii) the financial\nstatements and other related information supplied by Bitdeer were accepted as correct without further\nverification, (iv) no material facts have been withheld, (v) there will be no major changes in the existing\npolitical, legal, fiscal and economic conditions in which Bitdeer carries on its business, (vi) there will be no\nmajor changes in the current taxation law in the country where Bitdeer operates, that the rates of tax payable\nwill remain unchanged and that all applicable laws and regulations will be complied with, (vii) there will be no\nmaterial changes in the industry in which Bitdeer involves that would materially affect the revenue, profits or\ncash flows attributable to Bitdeer, (viii) Bitdeer and/or its partners will obtain the necessary licenses and\napprovals to provide its services, (ix) exchange rates and interest rates will not differ materially from those\npresently prevailing, (x) the availability of finance will not be a constraint on the forecasted growth of\noperations of Bitdeer, (xi) Bitdeer will maintain its competitiveness and market share through optimizing the\nutilization of its resources and expanding its marketing network, (xii) Bitdeer can keep abreast of the latest\ndevelopment of the industry such that its competitiveness and profitability can be sustained, (xiii) Bitdeer\nwill utilize and maintain its current operational, administrative and technical facilities to expand and increase\nits sales, (xiv) Bitdeer will be able to secure funds to repay its debts when they fall due, (xv) Bitdeer will\nretain and have competent management, key personnel, and technical staff to support its ongoing\noperations, (xvi) industry trends and market conditions for related industries will not deviate materially from\neconomic forecasts, and (xvii) Bitdeer has no material unrecorded and/or contingent asset/liability as at the\napplicable appraisal date.\nRoyson\u2019s opinion was based on business, economic, monetary, market and other considerations as they\nexisted and could reasonably be evaluated on, and the information made available to Royson as of, the date\nthereof. In particular, Royson noted that there was significant uncertainty in Bitdeer\u2019s industry and\nsignificant volatility in the future development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Subsequent developments\nmay have affected the opinion, and none of BSGA, Bitdeer, or Royson assume responsibility for updating or\nrevising the opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date thereof (regardless of the\nclosing date of the Business Combination). Royson\u2019s opinion is valid only as of the applicable appraisal date\nand Royson takes no responsibility for changes in market conditions and assume no obligation to revise\ntheir conclusion of value to reflect events or conditions which occur subsequent to the valuation date.\nThe following is a summary of the material analyses delivered by Royson to BSGA in connection with\nrendering valuation reports described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a\n138 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncomplete description of the analyses performed by Royson, nor does the order of analyses described\nrepresent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Royson. Except as otherwise noted, the\nfollowing information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or\nas of applicable appraisal date and is not necessarily indicative of the current market conditions.\nRoyson\u2019s Selection of Valuation Methods\nThe valuation approach is determined based on professional judgment and technical expertise after\ndetailed analysis on facts and circumstances. Key factors Royson considered include, among other criteria,\nbusiness nature and stage of development of the subject entity, the quantity and quality of the information\nprovided, access to available data, supply of relevant market transactions, type and nature of the subject\nasset, purpose and objective of the valuation. Royson has considered the three generally recognized\nvaluation approaches, namely cost approach, income approach, and market approach.\nUnder the cost approach, the fair market value of equity interest is determined based on the replacement\ncosts or reproduction costs of assets rather than the ability to generate streams of benefits in the future.\nThe value of a service company like Bitdeer is more driven by the future earnings to be generated than\nthe value of its assets. Bitdeer has established its own brand, its customer base and its business networks.\nThese are the intangible assets that exist in the business but not capitalized. Thus, the relationship between\nthe fair market value and the book costs is weak for Bitdeer. Therefore, Royson did not adopt the cost\napproach.\nUnder the market approach, there are two primary methods. The first, sometimes referred to as the\ncomparable transactions method, involves determining valuation multiples from sales of enterprises with\nsimilar financial and operating characteristics and applying those multiples to the subject enterprise. The\nsecond, sometimes referred to as the Guideline Publicly-Traded Comparable Method, involves identifying\nand selecting publicly traded enterprises with financial and operating characteristics similar to the enterprise\nbeing valued. Different value measures or market multiples of the comparable companies are calculated and\nanalyzed to induce a series of multiples that are considered representative of the industry average. Once\npublicly traded enterprises are identified, valuation multiples can be derived, adjusted for comparability, and\nthen applied to the subject enterprise to estimate the value of its equity or enterprise value.\nAccording to Royson\u2019s research, there were certain merger and acquisition transactions regarding\ncryptocurrencies mining companies that took place in the recent two years. However, there are limited\nhistorical and forecast operational and financial information available on these newly listed or acquired\nentities. Thus, the Comparable Transactions Method was not selected.\nOn the other hand, several major market players in the Bitcoin mining sector have been listed. Thus, the\nGuideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method has been selected as the principal valuation method for the\nvaluation of Bitdeer.\nFor the income approach, it relies on explicit financial forecasts which require many assumptions,\nincluding but not limiting to the forecasted Bitcoin price, the future total Bitcoin network hash rates, the size\nof transactions, the future transaction fees, the pace of market acceptance of cryptocurrency, the availability\nof mining rigs and mining farms, the stability of electricity supply, etc. It is considered as inferior to the\nmarket approach. In addition, the latest financial projection is not available for the 2023 Valuation Report and\nthus, the income approach is not selected.\nSelection of Comparable Publicly-traded Company Analysis\nIn applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method under the market approach, the fair\nmarket value is based on prices at which stocks of similar companies are trading in a public market. A \u201cvalue\nmeasure\u201d is usually a multiple computed by dividing the price of the guideline company\u2019s stock as at the\nvaluation date by certain relevant economic variable observed or calculated from the guideline company\u2019s\nfinancial statements.\nA major requirement in applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method is to identify\ncompanies that are comparable to the subject company in terms of business nature and associated risks.\nComparable companies for the 2023 Valuation Report were selected primarily based on the following criteria:\n139 \n* \n** \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(1) principally engaged in similar business (i.e., Bitcoin mining)\u037e (2) listed on a reputable capital market for\nnot less than 12 months from the Final Appraisal Date\u037e and (3) with disclosure and/ or recent market\nforecasts on their key performance and financial metrics (such as hash rate and earnings before interest, tax\nand depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d)) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on the\nforegoing criteria, Royson selected five companies which were considered as closely comparative to Bitdeer\n(the \u201cComparable Companies\u201d) listed in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for the 2023\nValuation Report. The Comparable Companies are considered as highly but not perfectly comparable with\nBitdeer in terms of capital structure, operating scale, product mix and business performance metrics. In\naddition, the Comparable Companies are major market players and have a majority of their revenue\ncontributed by Bitcoin mining operations. As such, Royson believes that the Comparable Companies are fair\nand representative for the purpose of issuing its 2023 Valuation Report for the proposed Business\nCombination. Descriptions of the Comparable Companies are summarized below:\nComparable Companies\nPrincipal Business\nMarket \nCapitalization \nas at the \nFinal Appraisal\nDate*\nHash rate as at \nJanuary 31, \n2023**\n1.

Royson applied the relevant industry multiples to the\nsubject company to determine a value for the subject company that is on a freely-traded basis.\nRoyson applied the market value of enterprise value (\u201cEV\u201d) multiple in its valuation of Bitdeer. EV\nequals to the sum of (1) market capitalization\u037e (2) value of total debt\u037e (3) value of preferred equity and non-\ncontrolling interest and less (4) value of cash and cash equivalents. EV is the value of a company\u2019s core\nbusiness operations that is available to all shareholders (debt, equity, preferred, etc.). Market capitalization\nadopted represents the average of the market capitalization of the Comparable Companies for the 15 trading\ndays prior to the Final Appraisal Date.\nHash rate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining. More simply, it is the\nspeed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be\nperformed. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and can process a lot of data in a single\nsecond. In the case of Bitcoin, the hash rate indicates the number of times hash values are calculated for\nPoW every second. Thus, hash rate is considered as one of the relevant economic multiples for this\nvaluation.\nIn recent years, the prices of Bitcoins have fluctuated greatly. The Bitcoin price decreased from\napproximately US$46,300 as at December 31, 2021 to approximately US$16,500 as at December 31, 2022, with\nthe peak on November 9, 2021 at US$67,600. As at the Final Appraisal Date, Bitcoin was valued at\napproximately US$24,300. The Bitcoin halving event is expected to take place in early 2024.\nThe EV-to-revenue ratio looks at the revenue generating ability in the same industry. Profitability and\nability to generate operating cash flows can be measured by EBITDA which is capital structure-neutral in\nnature. EBITDA is also useful for transnational comparisons because it ignores the distorting effects of\nindividual countries taxation policies.\nIn rendering the 2023 Valuation Report, Royson took into consideration changes in multiple aspects\nincluding but not limited to certain financial and operational information of Bitdeer, the market capitalization,\nrevenue and certain ratios of the Comparable Companies as at the Final Appraisal Date, as set forth below. In\nparticular, when applying the Guideline Publicly-traded Comparable Method, Royson applied the multiples of\n(1) EV-to-Forecasted/Actual Revenue for 2022\u037e (2) EV-to-Forecasted/actual EBITDA for 2022\u037e and (3) EV-to-\nHash rate as at January 31, 2023, which were the most recent available data of the Comparable Companies as\nof the Final Appraisal Date.\nBased on the publicly available market figures sourced from Bloomberg as of the Final Appraisal Date as\nwell as Bitdeer\u2019s updated financial and operating data provided by Bitdeer\u2019s management, Royson came up\nwith the following updated ratios of the Comparable Companies:\nAverage\nMedian\nFirst \nQuartile\nThird \nQuartile\nLow\nHigh\nEV-to-Forecasted/Actual Revenue for 2022\n5.12\n3.44\n3.18\n3.73\n2.16\n13.06\nEV-to-Forecasted/Actual EBITDA for 2022*\n14.10\n14.10\n11.3\n16.47\n9.36\n18.84\nEV-to-Hash rate as at 31 January 2023\n134.48\n113.94\n89.00\n170.62\n87.10\n221.75\nExcluded the Comparable Companies that had negative figure.\nThe indicated EV of Bitdeer is the weighted average of the product of the selected ratios of the\nComparable Companies generated and their relevant financial and operational information. Given the current\nmarket and recent developments of competitors and other crypto-based companies, the importance of\nrevenue and EBTIDA has increased, resulting in the suggested weighting. To derive the fair market value of\nthe entire equity interest, the net debts and non-operating assets and liabilities are first deducted from the\nindicated EV. Finally, the result is subject to a discount for a lack of marketability in order to derive the fair\nmarket value of the non-controlling, non-marketable equity interest in Bitdeer.\n141 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nReview by Audit Firm for Reasonableness of Valuation\nThe Audit Firm was retained by BSGA to perform a review on the valuation performed by Royson for its\nopinion. The Audit Firm, among other things:\nObtained and read Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer\u037e\nDiscussed with the Management, Royson and Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy firm engaged by\nBitdeer, to understand the business operations, the industry in which Bitdeer is operating and the\nsignificant matters that would affect the equity value of Bitdeer\u037e and\nDiscussed with the Management and Royson a number of key aspects of the valuation model and\nreport including the current market for crypto focused companies, bitcoin price, assumptions,\ncomparables and methodology used.\nThe review focused on the basis and reasonableness of the valuation, valuation methodology,\nassumptions and valuation parameters adopted by Royson. The Audit Firm determined the adoption of the\ncomparable companies selection was reasonable and aligned with generally accepted valuation practice. The\nAudit Firm also considered the calculation and market data used to determine the market multiples to be\nreasonable. The Audit Firm concluded that the valuation methodology, comparable company selection,\nadopted key parameters and calculations were generally accepted valuation procedures and concluded that\nthe business valuation performed by Royson to be reasonable.\nConclusions\nThe preparation of Royson\u2019s opinion was a complex, analytical process involving various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and the application of those\nmethods to the particular circumstances and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription.\nRoyson\u2019s 2023 Valuation Report, which was the report reviewed by the BSGA Board prior to approving\nthe final terms of the Business Combination, indicates that based upon the investigation, analysis and\nassumptions described herein and the appraisal method employed, the fair market value of the 100% non-\ncontrolling equity interest in Bitdeer as of Final Appraisal Date is reasonably stated to be one billion, two\nhundred and fifty six million (US $1,256,000,000).\nThe full text of the written opinions of Royson, dated November 17, 2021, December 14, 2021 and March 7, 2023,\nwhich set forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nreview undertaken in connection with the opinion, are attached to this proxy statement/\u200bprospectus as Annex D. You are\nencouraged to read the opinions in their entirety for a discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the scope of the review undertaken by Royson in rendering\nits opinions. Royson\u2019s opinions are directed to BSGA and addresses only their opinions on the fair market value of\n100% non-controlling equity interest in Bitdeer as of the respective appraisal date as set forth in each of the opinions.\nThe Royson opinions are not recommendations as to how any holder of BSGA ordinary shares should vote with respect\nto the Business Combination or any other matter. The summary of the opinions of Royson set forth above is qualified in\nits entirety by reference to the full text of the opinions.\nSelected Unaudited Financial and Other Information of Bitdeer\nIn connection with its consideration of the potential Business Combination, Bitdeer provided BSGA\nwith the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023. The\nSelected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023 were reviewed by\nthe BSGA Board in connection with its review of the updated valuation of Bitdeer in 2023. See the section\nentitled \u201c- Background of the Business Combination.\u201d\nThe Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate as of January 31, 2023 were\nprepared solely for internal use and not with a view toward public disclosure. BSGA did not prescribe or\nrelay any instructions, guidelines, parameters, inputs, assumptions or other directions to Bitdeer\u2019s\nmanagement with respect to the Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer and hash rate\ninformation included\n142 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin this proxy statement/prospectus. These unaudited financial information and hash rate information should\nnot be viewed as public guidance.\nThe Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer also includes adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS\nmeasure used by Bitdeer\u2019s management as a supplemental measure to review and assess Bitdeer\u2019s operating\nperformance. Bitdeer defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2. Such measure is not\nnecessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, such measure\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, Bitdeer\u2019s profit/(loss) for the\nperiods, as determined in accordance with IFRS.

IJW\u2019s opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the BSGA Board (solely in its capacity as such and not\nin any other capacity) in its evaluation of the Business Combination (and, in its engagement letter, IJW provided its\nconsent to the inclusion of the text of its opinion as part of this proxy statement/prospectus). IJW\u2019s opinion is limited\nsolely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by BSGA in the Business\nCombination and does not address BSGA\u2019s underlying business decision to effect the Business Combination or the\nrelative merits of the Business Combination as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that\nmight be available to BSGA. IJW\u2019s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder of BSGA\nshould vote or act with respect to the Business Combination or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, IJW, among other things:\nreviewed Selected Unaudited Financial Information of Bitdeer\u037e\nreviewed information relating to the industry in which Bitdeer operates\u037e\nreviewed certain internal information relating to expenses expected to result from the Business\nCombination\u037e\nconducted discussions with members of management and representatives of BSGA and Bitdeer\nconcerning the information described in the foregoing, as well as the business and prospects of\nBitdeer generally\u037e\nreviewed publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of\nbusiness of Bitdeer that IJW deemed relevant\u037e\nreviewed the Merger Agreement, including a draft dated March 7, 2023 of the Third Amendment\u037e\nreviewed BSGA\u2019s and Bitdeer\u2019s capital structure, both pre-Business Combination and post-Business\nCombination\u037e and\nconducted such other studies and analyses and took into account such other information as IJW\ndeemed appropriate.\nIn connection with its review, IJW, with the consent of the BSGA Board, relied on the information\nsupplied to, discussed with or reviewed by it for the purpose of its opinion being the best currently available\nestimates and judgment, good faith judgment on the competitive, operating and regulatory environment and\nrisks, and that there are no material misstatements and/or omissions of information. IJW did not assume any\nresponsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any such information. With\nthe consent of the BSGA Board, IJW relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of BSGA\nand its legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting\nmatters. With the consent of the BSGA Board, IJW has reviewed financial information provided and the\nunderlying assumptions for reasonableness, but expresses no opinion thereon. In addition, with the BSGA\nBoard\u2019s consent, IJW did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of Bitdeer or BSGA, nor was IJW furnished with any\nsuch evaluation or appraisal.\nIn rendering its fairness opinion to the BSGA Board, IJW primarily conducted a Selected Public\nCompanies Analysis and a Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. The following is a summary of the\nforegoing analysis conducted by IJW and presented to the BSGA Board.\nSelected Public Companies Analysis. IJW reviewed publicly available financial and stock market\ninformation of certain publicly traded companies that IJW deemed potentially comparable to the proprietary\ncrypto asset mining and hosting activities of Bitdeer. Based on its review, IJW considered the following 5\n144 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nselected companies (the \u201cGuideline Companies\u201d) to be relevant, given their business and financial\ncharacteristics, for purposes of IJW\u2019s analysis:\nRiot Platforms, Inc.\nMarathon Digital Holdings, Inc.\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.\nHut 8 Mining Corp.\nArgo Blockchain plc\nIJW reviewed, among other information, the closing stock prices as of February 17, 2023 (the date upon\nwhich the relevant terms of the merger documents were preliminarily agreed among the parties) of the\nGuideline Companies, as well as the trading prices for the fifteen trading days preceding the said date. IJW\nalso reviewed the EV of the Guideline Companies, calculated as fully diluted equity values based on an\naverage of the closing stock prices for the foregoing fifteen trading day period, plus total debt, preferred\nstock and non-controlling interests (as applicable), less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and plus or\nminus any non-operating assets and liabilities (as applicable), as multiples of 2022 revenue and EBITDA\nestimated from publicly available research analyst estimates and other publicly available information, as well\nas multiples of hashrate (EH/s).\nThe valuation multiples for the Guideline Companies ranged from revenue multiples of 2.16 to 13.06\n(with a mean of 5.12 and a median of 3.44), EBITDA multiples of 9.36 to 18.84 (with a mean and a median of\n14.10) and hashrate multiples of 87.10 to 211.75 (with a mean of 134.48 and a median of 113.94). Comparing\nBitdeer to the Guideline Companies, IJW noted that Bitdeer had comparatively higher revenue levels,\nparticularly from hosting activities, and higher EBITDA margins. Accordingly, IJW utilized the third quartile\nof valuation multiples: EV/revenue of 3.73, EV/EBITDA of 16.47 and EV/hashrate of 170.62. Applying the\nselected ranges of valuation multiples indicated EV reference ranges for Bitdeer of between US$700,000,000\nand US$1,503,000,000 and equity values of between US$944,000,000 and US$1,747,000,000. Applying a\nweighting to the results obtained from the selected valuation multiples of 40% to each of EV/revenue and\nEV/EBITDA and 20% to EV/hash rate (being that, from IJW\u2019s understanding, hash rate factors are likely\nreflected in the stock prices of the Guideline Companies), yielded an indicated equity value of\nUS$1,478,000,000. IJW next applied a discount for a lack of marketability of 15%, which implied a fair market\nvalue of equity of Bitdeer of US$1,256,000,000.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Using publicly available information, IJW reviewed the\nfinancial terms of selected precedent transactions in lines of business that it deemed potentially comparable\nto the proprietary cryptoasset mining and hosting activities of Bitdeer. Based on its review of the foregoing,\nIJW did not identify any such precedent transactions that it considered to be meaningful for purposes of its\nvaluation.\nIJW\u2019s opinion did not address BSGA\u2019s underlying business decision to effect the Business\nCombination or the relative merits of the Business Combination as compared to any alternative business\nstrategies or transactions that might be available to BSGA and did not address any legal, regulatory, tax, or\naccounting matters. IJW was not asked, nor did it offer, any opinion as to any terms of the Merger\nAgreement or any aspect or implication of the Business Combination, except for the fairness of the\nconsideration from a financial point of view to BSGA. IJW expressed no opinion as to what the value of the\nordinary shares or any other securities of BTG actually will be when issued pursuant to the Business\nCombination or the prices at which such ordinary shares or any other securities of BTG may trade at any\ntime. IJW did not express any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of Bitdeer or BSGA following the\nclosing of the Business Combination. In rendering its opinion, IJW assumed, with the BSGA Board\u2019s\nconsent, that the final executed form of the Third Amendment would not differ in any material respect from\nthe draft that it reviewed, that the Business Combination would be consummated in accordance with its\nterms without any waiver or modification that could be material to IJW\u2019s analysis, and that the parties to the\nMerger Agreement will comply with all the material terms thereof. In addition, representatives of BSGA\nadvised IJW, and IJW assumed, with the BSGA Board\u2019s consent, that the Business Combination would\nqualify as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes. IJW also was not requested to, and did not,\nparticipate in the structuring or negotiation of the\n145 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBusiness Combination. Except as described in this summary, the BSGA Board imposed no other instructions\nor limitations on IJW with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by IJW in rendering its\nopinion.\nIJW\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect\non, and the information made available to IJW as of, the date of its opinion, and IJW assumed no\nresponsibility to update the opinion for developments after the date thereof.\nIJW\u2019s opinion did not address the fairness of the Business Combination or any aspect or implication of\nthe Business Combination to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any creditors or\nother non-shareholder constituencies of BSGA or to Bitdeer. In addition, IJW did not express any opinion as\nto the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or\nemployees of any parties to the Business Combination, or any class of such persons, relative to the\nconsideration or otherwise.\nThe above summary of the analyses is not a complete description of IJW\u2019s opinion or the analyses\nunderlying, and factors considered in connection with, IJW\u2019s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion\nis a complex analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.\nIn arriving at its fairness determination, IJW considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, IJW made its fairness determination on the basis of its\nexperience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nThe consideration was determined through arms\u2019 length negotiations between BSGA and Bitdeer and\nwas approved by the BSGA Board. IJW did not recommend any specific consideration to BSGA or the BSGA\nBoard, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration\nfor the Business Combination.\nIJW was engaged by BSGA to provide its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to\nBSGA of the consideration. The terms of its engagement by BSGA were under the engagement letter between\nIJW and BSGA, dated as of February 25, 2023 (the \u201cIJW Engagement Letter\u201d). IJW will receive a fee for its\nservices based on the time incurred for providing such services. All time incurred in relation to the Fairness\nOpinion shall be invoiced on a monthly basis and become immediately due and payable upon the submission\nof the invoice. No part of IJW\u2019s fee is conditioned upon the conclusion expressed in its opinion or\ncontingent upon the closing of the Business Combination. BSGA has also agreed pursuant to the IJW\nEngagement Letter to reimburse IJW for certain expenses IJW has incurred in performing services\ncontemplated thereunder, and to indemnify IJW for certain liabilities, including liabilities under any statute or\ncommon law, arising out of its engagement.\nIJW may provide investment banking and other services to affiliates of BSGA and in the future may\nprovide services to such persons and may receive compensation for such services. Except for financial\nadvisory services rendered by IJW to affiliates of BSGA in connection with a prior business combination for\nwhich IJW charged a fee of approximately US$120,000, neither IJW nor any of its affiliates or unaffiliated\nrepresentatives has performed any services for Bitdeer, BSGA or their respective affiliates in the past three\nyears prior to the date of the Fairness Opinion.\nThe BSGA Board selected IJW as its financial advisor in connection with the Business Combination\nbecause IJW has substantial experience in similar transactions and possess significant valuation experience\nin the crypto asset and blockchain sectors. IJW is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, strategic transactions, corporate restructurings, and\nvaluations for corporate and other purposes.\nReasons for BSGA Board\u2019s Approval of the Business Combination\nBSGA was formed to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase,\nreorganization, or similar business combination with one or more business entities. As described above, the\nBSGA Board sought to do so by using the networks and industry experience of both the Sponsor, the BSGA\nBoard, and BSGA management to identify and acquire one or more businesses.\n146 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn evaluating the transaction with Bitdeer, the BSGA Board consulted with its legal counsel and\naccounting and other advisors. In determining that the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and\nthe transactions contemplated thereby are in BSGA\u2019s best interests, the BSGA Board considered and\nevaluated a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed below. In light of the\nnumber and wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby, the BSGA Board did not consider it practicable to, and did not\nattempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that the BSGA Board\nconsidered in reaching its determination and supporting its decision. The BSGA Board viewed its decision as\nbeing based on all of the information available and the factors presented to and considered by the BSGA\nBoard. In addition, individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. The BSGA Board\nrealized that there can be no assurance about future results, including results considered or expected as\ndisclosed in the following reasons. This explanation of BSGA\u2019s reasons for the Business Combination and all\nother information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light\nof the factors discussed under \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe members of the BSGA Board are well qualified to evaluate the Business Combination with Bitdeer.\nThe BSGA Board and management collectively have extensive transactional experience.\nIn particular, in addition to its review of Bitdeer\u2019s equity value and considerations to be paid in\nconnection with the proposed Business Combination (see \u201c- BSGA Board\u2019s Review of Valuation\u201d), the BSGA\nBoard considered the following reasons or made the following determinations, as applicable:\nBitdeer satisfies a number of acquisition criteria that BSGA had established to evaluate prospective\nbusiness combination targets. The BSGA Board considered the business, history, prospects,\ncredibility, and valuation of Bitdeer and its affiliates, and determined that Bitdeer satisfies a number of\ncriteria and guidelines set forth during the IPO, including (i) unique competitive advantage in the\nmarkets and/or underexploited growth opportunities that BSGA is uniquely positioned to identify\u037e (ii)\nstrong management team that can create significant value\u037e and (iii) potential to generate strong free\ncash flow.\nFavorable prospects for future growth. Information from BSGA and Bitdeer\u2019s management regarding\n(i) Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, services, management,\ncompetitive position, and strategic business goals and objectives\u037e (ii) general economic, industry,\nregulatory, and financial market conditions\u037e and (iii) opportunities and competitive factors within\nBitdeer\u2019s industry.\nWorld\u2019s largest scale of proprietary hash rate. Bitdeer was the world\u2019s largest holder of proprietary\nhash rate for Bitcoin as at June 30, 2021, according to Frost & Sullivan. Its proprietary hash rate\nprovides it with a clear edge in all of its business lines and anchors its unique business model.\nUnique business model powers organic hash rate expansion. Bitdeer established a business model\nthat allows it to reinforce its market-leading position and compete in terms of scaling up our\nproprietary hash rate.\nAmple power supply and low electricity cost secured by global mining datacenters. Bitdeer\nstrategically opened five mining datacenters in the United States and Norway, where low electricity\ncost and crypto-friendly policies support stable operations. With experience in site selection, facility\ndesign, construction and maintenance in over 30 locations around the globe, Bitdeer\u2019s dedicated\nglobal team for mining datacenter construction understands the critical needs of Bitcoin mining as\nwell as the complex and constantly evolving global landscape of electricity supply. They also have\nextensive connections with local electricity experts and power enterprises around the world.\nVisionary management team with a proven track record of innovation and execution. Bitdeer is led\nby a management team with extensive experience in the cryptocurrency industry, encompassing\nresearch and development, mining and sales of mining machines, and many of them are pioneers in\nmining datacenters construction and operation.\nIn particular, the BSGA Board considered Mr. Wu\u2019s holdings of BTG securities following the Business\nCombination, and his ability to sell substantially all such holdings yet still retain control over the\ncompany due to his BTG Class V Ordinary Share holdings. These aspects did not change BSGA\nBoard\u2019s determination because (i) the BSGA Board took notice that similar dual-class shareholding\n147 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nstructure had been adopted by other public companies for the benefit of their founders\u037e (ii) Mr. Wu\nwill be subject to lock-up\u037e (iii) upon Closing, Mr. Wu will still be subject to his fiduciary duties under\nthe laws of the Cayman Islands and the Amended BTG Articles (which form is included as Annex B to\nthis proxy statement/prospectus) in exercising his decision-making powers as an executive of BTG\u037e\nand (iv) the BSGA Board reviewed Mr. Wu\u2019s professional and industry experience, as well as his long\ntenure with Bitdeer.\nBest Available Opportunity. The BSGA Board determined, after a thorough review of other business\ncombination opportunities reasonably available to BSGA, that the proposed Business Combination\nrepresents the best potential business combination for BSGA based upon the process utilized to\nevaluate and assess other potential acquisition targets, and the BSGA Board\u2019s belief that such\nprocesses had not presented a better alternative.\nContinued Significant Ownership by Bitdeer. The BSGA Board considered that Bitdeer\u2019s existing\nequity holders would be receiving a significant amount of BTG Ordinary Shares in the proposed\nBusiness Combination and that Bitdeer\u2019s principal shareholders and key executives are \u201crolling over\u201d\ntheir existing equity interests of Bitdeer into equity interests in BTG. The current Bitdeer\nShareholders are expected to own approximately 93.6% of the outstanding BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares, constituting approximately 11.0% of the voting power of the BTG Ordinary Shares voting\ntogether as a single class, assuming none of BSGA\u2019s public shareholders exercise their redemption\nrights in connection with the Business Combination.\nUse of Retained Proceeds. As represented by Bitdeer\u2019s management, the proceeds to be delivered to\nBTG in connection with the Business Combination (including funds that remain in BSGA\u2019s trust\naccount after taking into effect redemptions), are expected to remain on the balance sheet of BTG\nafter Closing in order to fund Bitdeer\u2019s existing operations and support new and existing growth\ninitiatives. The BSGA Board considered this benefits to be realized as a result of the Business\nCombination.\nLikelihood of Closing the Business Combination. The BSGA Board believes that an acquisition by\nBSGA has a reasonable likelihood of closing without potential issues under applicable antitrust and\ncompetition laws and without potential issues from any regulatory authorities.\nThe BSGA Board also considered a variety of uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative\nfactors concerning the Business Combination, including but not limited to the following:\nBusiness risk. The risk that the future financial performance of Bitdeer may not meet the BSGA\nBoard\u2019s expectations due to factors in Bitdeer\u2019s control or out of Bitdeer\u2019s control, such as Bitdeer\u2019s\nfailure to continuously innovate, to attract and retain customers, to adapt to new businesses, to\nobtain sufficient capital, to maintain its competitive edge in the crypto mining business, among\nothers.\nIndustry risk. The risk that the cryptocurrency industry in which Bitdeer operates is significantly\nimpacted by the sharp fluctuations in Bitcoin prices and or significant adverse regulatory\ndevelopments.\nClosing of the Business Combination May Not Occur. The risks and costs to BSGA if the Business\nCombination is not completed, including the risk of diverting management focus and resources to\nother business combination opportunities, which could result in BSGA being unable to effect a\nbusiness combination within the timeframe set forth under BSGA\u2019s current charter, forcing BSGA to\nliquidate the trust account.\nCurrent Public Shareholders Exercising Redemption Rights. The risk that some of BSGA\u2019s current\npublic shareholders would decide to exercise their redemption rights, thereby depleting the amount of\ncash available in the trust account.\nClosing Conditions of the Business Combination. The fact that the Closing is conditioned on\nsatisfying certain closing conditions, many of which are not within BSGA\u2019s control.\nBSGA Shareholders Not Holding a Majority Position in BTG. The fact that BSGA Shareholders will\nnot hold a majority position in BTG following the Business Combination, which may reduce the\ninfluence that BSGA\u2019s current shareholders have on BTG\u2019s management.\nPost-Closing Corporate Governance. The fact that post-Closing, Mr. Jihan Wu will control the\nvoting power of all outstanding BTG Class V Ordinary Shares and the voting power of approximately\n88.3%\n148 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof total issued and outstanding BTG Ordinary Shares voting together as a single class assuming a No\nRedemption Scenario and that, all of Bitdeer\u2019s outstanding restricted share units vest and all\nremaining Bitdeer Ordinary Shares available for grant under the BTG Incentive Plan, which will have\none vote per share when granted, are granted to employees other than Mr. Jihan Wu. Given Mr. Jihan\nWu\u2019s voting power over the BTG Ordinary Shares as described in this paragraph, he will effectively\nbe able to nominate, appoint and remove the entirety of BTG\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Jihan Wu will\ntherefore have decisive influence over matters requiring shareholder approval by ordinary resolution\nand significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval by special resolution, including\nsignificant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of BTG or its assets.\nLitigation Related to the Business Combination. The risk of potential litigation challenging the\nBusiness Combination.\nNo Survival of Remedies for Breach of Representations, Warranties or Covenants of Bitdeer. The\nMerger Agreement provides that BSGA will not have any surviving remedies against Bitdeer or its\nequity holders after the Closing to recover for losses as a result of any inaccuracies or breaches of\nthe representations, warranties or covenants of Bitdeer set forth in the Merger Agreement. As a\nresult, BSGA Shareholders could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in the\nfinancial performance or worsening of financial condition of Bitdeer prior to the Closing, whether\ndetermined before or after the Closing, without any ability to recover for the amount of any damages.\nThe BSGA Board determined that this structure was appropriate and customary in light of the fact\nthat several similar transactions include similar terms and the current equity holders of Bitdeer will be,\ncollectively, the majority equity holders in BTG and therefore would bear a majority of any such\nlosses.\nTransaction Fees and Expenses Incurred by BSGA. The substantial transaction fees and expenses to\nbe incurred in connection with the Business Combination and the negative impact of such expenses\non BSGA\u2019s cash reserves and operating results if the Business Combination is not completed.\nNegative Impact Resulting from the Announcement of the Business Combination. The possible\nnegative effect of the Business Combination and public announcement of the Business Combination\nof BSGA\u2019s financial performance, operating results, and share price.\nOther Risks. Other factors that the BSGA Board deemed relevant, including various other risks\nassociated with the Business Combination, BSGA\u2019s business, and Bitdeer\u2019s business as described\nunder \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nSatisfaction of 80% Test\nAfter consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section entitled \u201cThe Business\nCombination Proposal\u202f-\u202fReasons for BSGA Board\u2019s Approval of the Business Combination,\u201d the BSGA\nBoard concluded that the Business Combination met the requirements disclosed in the IPO prospectus with\nrespect to BSGA\u2019s initial business combination, including that the Business Combination had a fair market\nvalue of at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the Trust Account at the time of execution of the Merger\nAgreement.\nInterests of BSGA Directors and Officers in the Business Combination\nThe BSGA Board concluded that the potential benefits that the BSGA Board expected BSGA and its\nshareholders to achieve as a result of the Business Combination outweighed the potentially negative factors\nassociated with the Business Combination. Accordingly, the BSGA Board determined that the Merger\nAgreement, the Business Combination, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nwere in BSGA\u2019s best interests.\nWhen you consider the recommendation of the Board in favor of approval of the Business Combination,\nyou should keep in mind that BSGA\u2019s directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that\nare different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder, including:\nIf we are unable to consummate an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline, we will,\nas promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of\nthe outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount\nthen on\n149 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndeposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net\nof interest that may be used by us to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses), divided by\nthe number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public\nshareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if\nany), subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and\nliquidate. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our private\nplacement rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by\nthe Combination Deadline.\nPrior to the IPO, our Sponsor held 1,437,500 Founder Shares. The Founder Shares will automatically\nconvert into an aggregate of 1,437,500 BTG Class A Ordinary Shares at the time of the Business\nCombination.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 292,500 BSGA Units at a\nprice of US$10.00 per unit for an aggregate purchase price of US$2,925,000. If we do not consummate\nthe Business Combination by the Combination Deadline, then the proceeds from the sale of the\nprivate placement units will be part of the liquidating distribution to the public shareholders and the\nunits held by our Sponsor will be worthless.\nOur Sponsor has made an investment for the Founder Shares at an average price per share of\napproximately US$0.017 prior to the consummation of the IPO. As a result of the significantly lower\ninvestment per share of the Sponsor as compared to the investment per share of our public\nshareholders (which was US$10.00 per unit), a transaction that results in an increase in the value of\nthe investment of the Sponsor in the Founder Shares (such as the Business Combination) may result\nin a decrease in the value of the investment of our Public Shareholders between (i) the purchase price\nthat the Sponsor paid for the Founder Shares and (ii) the price of the Public Shares, and considering\nthe substantial number of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares that the Sponsor will receive upon\nconversion of the Founder Shares, the Sponsor can earn a positive return on their investment, even if\nother BSGA shareholders have a negative return on their investment in BTG.\nThe Sponsor made an investment of US$2,950,000, consisting of the Sponsor\u2019s US$25,000 initial\ninvestment and the Sponsor\u2019s US$2,925,000 private placement units purchase price. Such investment\nrepresents an effective per share price of US$1.64. The Sponsor will lose such investment if we do not\ncomplete an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline.\nThe exercise of BSGA\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the\nterms of the transaction may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes\nor waivers are appropriate and in our shareholders\u2019 best interest.\nThe Sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating\ndistributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if BSGA fails to complete\nan initial business combination by the Combination Deadline. The Sponsor and our officers and\ndirectors have not received any consideration for such waiver.\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable\nto us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a\nprospective target business with which we have entered into a transaction agreement, reduce the\namount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a\nthird party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies\nheld in the Trust Account or to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the offering\nagainst certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.\nFollowing the Closing, the Sponsor would be entitled to the repayment of any working capital loan\nand advances that have been made to BSGA and remain outstanding. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, our Sponsor has not made any working capital loan or advances to us for\nworking capital expenses. If we do not complete the Business Combination within the required period,\nwe may use a portion of our working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the working\ncapital loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the working capital\nloans. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no such working capital loans were\noutstanding.\n150 \n\u2022 \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBSGA\u2019s current charter contains a waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine. With such waiver,\nthere could be business combination targets that may be suitable or worth consideration for a\ncombination with BSGA but not offered due to a BSGA director\u2019s duties to another entity. BSGA does\nnot believe that the potential conflict of interest relating to the waiver of the corporate opportunities\ndoctrine in current charter impacted its search for an acquisition target and BSGA was not prevented\nfrom reviewing any opportunities as a result of such waiver.\nThe foregoing interests present a risk that the Sponsor, BSGA\u2019s officers and directors, and their\naffiliates will benefit from the completion of a business combination, including in a manner that may not be\naligned with the Public Shareholders. As such, the Sponsor and BSGA\u2019s officers and directors may be\nincentivized to complete a business combination with a less favorable target company or on terms less\nfavorable to Public Shareholders rather than to liquidate. See the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u202f-\u202fRisks\nRelated to BSGA and the Business Combination\u202f-\u202fBSGA\u2019s directors and officers may have certain conflicts in\ndetermining to recommend the acquisition of Bitdeer, since certain of their interests, and certain interests of\ntheir affiliates and associates, are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder.\u201d\nAppraisal Rights\nAppraisal rights are available to holders of BSGA Ordinary Shares in connection with the Business\nCombination.\nUnder section 179 of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended), holders of BSGA Ordinary\nShares will have the right to dissent from the Business Combination. Should a holder of BSGA Ordinary\nShares wish to exercise their appraisal right, they must give written notice of their objection to the Business\nCombination to BSGA prior to the Special Meeting, or at the meeting but before the vote on the Business\nCombination. Such notice must include a statement that the BSGA shareholder proposes to demand payment\nfor their shares if the Business Combination is undertaken.\nAssuming that the Business Combination is approved, BSGA must give notice to any BSGA\nshareholder who gave written notice of their objection to the Business Combination within 20 days of the\ndate of the Special Meeting at which the Business Combination is approved. Within 20 days following the\ndate of receipt of that notice, the dissenting shareholder must give notice to BSGA of their election to\ndissent, which notice must include: (a) the shareholder\u2019s name and address\u037e (b) the number and class of\nshares in respect of which they dissent (which must be all of the shares that the shareholder holds in BSGA)\u037e\nand (c) a demand for payment of the fair value of the shares. Once such notice has been given to BSGA, the\ndissenting shareholder ceases to have any rights as a shareholder of BSGA except for the right to be paid\nthe fair value of their shares.\nWithin seven days of the expiration of the 20-day period in which a BSGA shareholder may serve notice\nof dissent (or seven days following the First SPAC Merger, whichever is the later), BSGA shall make a written\noffer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase their shares at a specified price that BSGA determine to be\ntheir fair value. If, within 30 days of the date on which that offer is made, BSGA and the dissenting\nshareholder agree upon the price to be paid for the shares, BSGA shall pay that amount to the shareholder\nupon the surrender of the certificates representing their shares.\nIf agreement on the price to be paid for the shares cannot be reached, within 20 days of the expiration of\nthe 30-day period referred to above the following procedure shall be followed:\nBSGA and the dissenting shareholder shall each designate an appraiser\u037e\nthe two designated appraisers together shall designate an appraiser\u037e\nthe three appraisers shall fix the fair value of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholder as of\nthe close of business on the day prior to the date on which the Business Combination was\napproved, excluding any appreciation or depreciation directly or indirectly induced by the Business\nCombination or its proposal, and that value is binding on BSGA and the dissenting shareholder for\nall purposes\u037e and\nBSGA shall pay to the dissenting shareholder that amount in money, upon the surrender of the\ncertificates representing their shares.\n151 \n(i) \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTotal Ordinary Shares Outstanding Upon Consummation of the Business Combination\nThe total number of ordinary shares to be issued and outstanding immediately following completion of\nthe Business Combination will be 112,869,011. We anticipate that the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders will hold 96.4%\nof our outstanding ordinary shares, and the current BSGA Shareholders will hold 3.6% of our outstanding\nordinary shares, immediately following completion of the Business Combination. This percentage (i) assumes\nthat no public shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, (ii) does not take into\naccount any Bitdeer\u2019s equity incentive award that are assumed by BTG in connection with the Business\nCombination and will be outstanding immediately following the Business Combination, (iii) does not take\ninto account any equity awards that may be issued under the proposed BTG Incentive Plan following the\nBusiness Combination, and (iv) does not take into account any Net Debt adjustments to the Merger\nConsideration.\nAnticipated Accounting Treatment\nThe Business Combination will be accounted for as a \u201creverse recapitalization\u201d in accordance with\nIFRS. Under this method of accounting, BSGA will be treated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company for financial\nreporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business\nCombination, the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders are expected to have a majority of the voting power of BTG, Bitdeer\nwill comprise all of the ongoing operations of combined company, Bitdeer will comprise a majority of the\ngoverning body of combined company, and Bitdeer\u2019s senior management will comprise all of the senior\nmanagement of combined company. Since BSGA does not meet the definition of a business under IFRS, the\ntransaction is outside the scope of IFRS 3, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, and it is accounted for as an equity-\nsettled, share-based payment transaction in accordance with IFRS 2,\u201cShare-based Payments\u201d. Accordingly,\nfor accounting purposes, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of Bitdeer issuing\nshares for the net assets of BSGA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BSGA will be stated\nat historical costs. Any difference in the fair value of the consideration deemed to have been issued by\nBitdeer and the fair value of BSGA\u2019s identifiable net assets represents a listing service received by Bitdeer\nand is recorded through profit and loss. No goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. Operations\nprior to the Business Combination will be those of Bitdeer.\nRedemption Rights\nPursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles, holders of Public Shares may elect to have their shares\nredeemed for cash at the applicable redemption price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)\nthe aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of\nthe Business Combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), by (ii) the total number of then-\noutstanding Public Shares. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, this would have amounted to\napproximately US$10.87 per share.\nYou will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Shares to be redeemed only if you:\n(a) hold Public Shares, or\n(b) hold Public Shares through Units and you elect to separate your BSGA Units into the\nunderlying public shares prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public\nshares\u037e and\nprior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 7, 2023, (a) submit a written request to Continental that\nBSGA redeem your public shares for cash and (b) deliver your public shares to Continental,\nphysically or electronically through DTC.\nHolders of outstanding BSGA Units must separate the underlying BSGA Ordinary Shares prior to\nexercising Redemption Rights with respect to the Public Shares. If the BSGA Units are registered in a\nholder\u2019s own name, the holder must deliver the certificate for its BSGA Units to Continental, with written\ninstructions to separate the BSGA Units into their individual component parts. This must be completed far\nenough in advance to permit the mailing of the certificates back to the holder so that the holder may then\nexercise his, her or its redemption rights upon the separation of the public shares from the BSGA Units.\n152 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a holder exercises its Redemption Rights, then such holder will be exchanging its Public Shares for\ncash and will no longer own shares of BSGA. Such a holder will be entitled to receive cash for its Public\nShares only if it properly demands Redemption and delivers its shares (either physically or electronically) to\nContinental in accordance with the procedures described herein. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe\nExtraordinary General Meeting\u202f\u202f-\u202f\u202fRedemption Rights\u201d for the procedures to be followed if you wish to\nredeem your public shares for cash.\nResolutions to be Voted Upon\nThe text of the resolution to be voted upon is as follows:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the amended and restated agreement and plan of merger dated December 15, 2021 (as\nit may be amended and / or restated from time to time, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), by and among Bitdeer\nTechnologies Group, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands (\u201cBTG\u201d), Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company with limited liability\nincorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (\u201cBitdeer\u201d), BSGA, Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British\nVirgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cBSGA Merger Sub 1\u201d), Blue Safari\nMerge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cBSGA\nMerger Sub 2\u201d), Bitdeer Merge Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the\nlaws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cBitdeer Merger Sub\u201d) and Blue Safari\nMini Corp.

Under\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5635(b), shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities when the\nissuance or potential issuance will result in a change of control.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, based on Bitdeer\u2019s and BSGA\u2019s current capitalization, we anticipate\nthat we will issue to the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders as consideration in the Business Combination, 108,758,873\nBTG Ordinary Shares. See the section entitled \u201cThe Business Combination Proposal - The Merger\nAgreement - Merger Consideration.\u201d Because the number of shares we anticipate issuing as consideration in\nthe Business Combination (1) will constitute more than 20% of BSGA\u2019s outstanding shares and more than\n20% of outstanding voting power prior to such issuance and (2) will result in a change of control of BSGA,\nwe are required to obtain shareholder approval of such issuance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(a)\nand (b).\nEffect of Proposal on Current Shareholders\nIf the Nasdaq Proposal is adopted, BTG would issue BTG Ordinary Shares representing more than 20%\nof the outstanding ordinary shares in connection with the Business Combination. The issuance of such\nsecurities would result in significant dilution to the BSGA Shareholders and would afford such shareholders\na smaller percentage interest in the voting power, liquidation value and aggregate book value of BSGA. If the\nNasdaq Proposal is adopted, assuming 108,758,873 ordinary shares are issued to the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders\nas consideration in the Business Combination, we anticipate that the Bitdeer\u2019s shareholders will hold 96.4%\nof our outstanding ordinary shares, and the current BSGA Shareholders will hold 3.6% of our outstanding\nordinary shares immediately following completion of the Business Combination. This percentage assumes\nthat no ordinary shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, does not take into\naccount any warrants or options to purchase our ordinary shares that will be outstanding following the\nBusiness Combination, or any equity awards that may be issued under our proposed Management Incentive\nPlan following the Business Combination.\nIf the Nasdaq Proposal is not approved and we consummate the Business Combination on its current\nterms, BSGA would be in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), which could result in the delisting of our\nsecurities from the Nasdaq Stock Market. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we\ncould face significant material adverse consequences, including:\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities\u037e\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities\u037e\na determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our\nsecurities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in\nthe secondary trading market for our securities\u037e\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the post-transaction company\u037e and\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIt is a condition to the obligations of BSGA and Bitdeer to close the Business Combination that BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, if the Nasdaq Proposal is not\nadopted, the Business Combination may not be completed unless this condition is waived.\n155 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nResolution to be Voted Upon\nThe full text of the resolution to be passed is as follows:\n\u201cRESOLVED that the issuance of up to 112,869,011 ordinary shares in connection with the Business\nCombination be approved and adopted in all respects.\u201d\nVote Required for Approval\nThis Nasdaq Proposal will be approved and adopted only if holders of at least a majority of the issued\nand outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual attendance or represented\nby proxy and entitled to vote and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Nasdaq\nProposal.

The BSGA\nBoard intends to adopt the BTG Incentive Plan, subject to approval from the holders of BSGA Ordinary\nShares. If approved, the BTG Incentive Plan will become effective upon the Closing and will be used by BTG\nfollowing the Closing.\nThe BSGA Board believes that BTG must offer a competitive equity incentive program if it is to\nsuccessfully attract and retain the best possible candidates for positions of substantial responsibility within\nBTG. The BSGA Board expects that the BTG Incentive Plan will be an important factor in attracting, retaining\nand rewarding high caliber employees who are essential to BTG\u2019s success and in providing incentive to\nthese individuals to promote the success of BTG.\nSummary of the BTG Incentive Plan\nThe following summary is not a complete statement of the BTG Incentive Plan and is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the complete text of the BTG Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as\nAnnex C to this proxy statement/prospectus.\nShares Available for Awards\nSubject to adjustment for specified changes in BTG\u2019s capitalization as set forth in the BTG Incentive\nPlan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of common share that may be issued under the BTG Incentive\nPlan will be equal to the product of (i) 2,548,933,157, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the\nMerger Agreement).\nThe following shares of common shares will become available again for the grant of a share award under\nthe BTG Incentive Plan: (i) any share issued pursuant to a share award that terminates, expires, or lapses for\nany reason\u037e (ii) any share delivered by the participant or withheld by BTG upon the exercise of any award\nunder the BTG Inventive Plan, in payment of the exercise price thereof or tax withholding thereon\u037e and (iii)\nany share issued pursuant to a share award that is forfeited by the participant or repurchased by BTG.\nAdministration\nThe BTG Incentive Plan will be administered by a Committee of one or more members of the Board to\nwhom the Board shall delegate the authority to grant or amend awards to participants other than any of the\nCommittee members. Subject to the terms of the BTG Incentive Plan, the Committee has full and final power\nand authority to make all decisions and determinations that may be required pursuant to the BTG Incentive\nPlan or as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to administer the BTG Incentive Plan, including:\ndetermine participants to receive awards\u037e the type and number of awards to be granted\u037e the terms and\nconditions of any award granted pursuant to the BTG Incentive Plan, including, but not limited to, the\nexercise price, grant price, or purchase price, any restrictions or limitations on the award, any schedule for\nlapse of forfeiture restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of an award, and accelerations or waivers\nthereof, any provisions related to non-competition and recapture of gain on an award\u037e prescribe the form of\neach notice of grant\u037e and correct any defect, supply any omission and reconcile any inconsistency in the\nBTG Incentive Plan. The Committee also has the authority to reduce the exercise price per share underlying\nan option, and establish, adopt, waive, or revise any rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or\nadvisable to administer the BTG Incentive Plan.\nTypes of Awards\nThe terms of the BTG Incentive Plan provide for the grant of share options, restricted share units, and\nrestricted shares.\nOptions. The Committee will be authorized to grant options to purchase shares of common share that\nare either \u201cqualified,\u201d meaning they are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code for\nincentive share options (\u201cISOs\u201d), or \u201cnonqualified,\u201d meaning they are not intended to satisfy the\nrequirements\n165 \u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Section 422 of the Code. Options granted under the BTG Incentive Plan will be subject to terms, including\nthe exercise price and the conditions and timing of exercise, determined by the Committee and specified in\nthe applicable award agreement. In general, the exercise price per share of common share for each non-\nqualified share option (\u201cNSO\u201d) granted under the BTG Incentive Plan will be a fixed or variable price related\nto the fair market value. The exercise price per share of common share for each ISO granted under the BTG\nIncentive Plan will be equal to the fair market value (or 110% of the fair market value, in the case of ISOs\ngranted to a more than 10% shareholder) of the share at the time of grant. The maximum term of an option\ngranted under the Incentive Plan will be ten years from the date of grant. Payment in respect of the exercise\nof an option may be made in cash or by check, or the Committee may, in its discretion and to the extent\npermitted by law, allow the payment to be made through a broker-assisted cashless exercise mechanism, a\nshare tender exercise, or by any other method that the Committee determines to be appropriate.\nRestricted Share Awards. The Committee will be authorized to award restricted shares under the BTG\nIncentive Plan. Each award of restricted share will be subject to the terms and conditions established by the\nCommittee, including any dividend or voting rights. Restricted share awards are shares of common share that\ngenerally are non-transferable and subject to other restrictions determined by the Committee for a specified\nperiod. Unless the Committee determines otherwise or specifies otherwise in an award agreement, if the\nparticipant terminates employment or services during the restricted period, then any unvested restricted\nshare is forfeited.\nRestricted Share Units. The Committee will be authorized to award restricted share unit awards under\nthe BTG Incentive Plan. The Committee will determine the terms of the restricted share units, including any\ndividend rights (and any performance goals and/or criteria upon whose attainment the restricted period shall\nlapse in part or full). Unless the Committee determines otherwise or specifies otherwise in an award\nagreement, if the participant terminates employment or services during the period of time over which all or a\nportion of the units are to be earned, then any unvested units will be forfeited.\nPlan Amendment or Termination.\nWith the approval of the Board, at any time and from time to time, the Committee has the authority to\nterminate, amend, modify, alter, suspend, or discontinue the BTG Incentive Plan or any portion thereof.\nEligibility\nPersons eligible to participate in the BTG Incentive Plan include persons recognized by the Committee,\ne.g., directors, employees and consultants, as determined by the Committee.\nTerms and Conditions of Awards\nAll Awards\nGenerally, the Committee will determine the terms of all awards under the BTG Incentive Plan, including\nthe vesting and acceleration of vesting of awards, provisions for the withholding of taxes, and payment of\namounts in lieu of cash dividends or other cash distributions with respect to BTG\u2019s common share subject to\nawards.\nAwards Requiring Exercise\nIncentive share options and, except as provided in the award agreement, nonqualified share options,\nmay not be transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during an employee\u2019s\nlifetime may be exercised only by the employee or the employee\u2019s guardian or legal representative. Upon the\ncessation of a participant\u2019s employment with BTG, an award requiring exercise will cease to be exercisable\nand will terminate and all other unvested awards will be forfeited, except that:\nAll share options held by the participant which were exercisable immediately prior to the participant\u2019s\ntermination of service with BTG other than for Cause (as defined in the BTG Incentive Plan) will,\nexcept as otherwise set forth in the option award agreement, remain exercisable until the tenth\nanniversary of the grant date to the extent that such options were vested and exercisable on the date\nof the participant\u2019s termination of employment or service\u037e\n166 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAll share options held by the participant which were exercisable immediately prior to the participant\u2019s\ntermination of service with BTG due to death or disability will remain exercisable until the tenth\nanniversary of the grant date to the extent that such options were vested and exercisable on the date\nof the participant\u2019s termination of employment on account of death or disability\nThe exercise price of each award requiring exercise will be determined by the Committee and set forth in\nthe Notice of Grant which may be a fixed or variable price related to the Fair Market Value of the Shares\u037e\nprovided that the exercise price of incentive share options shall be equal to the Fair Market Value on the date\nof grant\u037e and incentive share options granted to participants who own share of BTG possessing more than\n10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of share of BTG or any parent corporation, subsidiary\ncorporation or affiliate of BTG (a \u201cTen Percent Holder\u201d) must have an exercise price per share not less than\n110% of the fair market value of a share of common share on the effective date the incentive share option is\ngranted. Fair market value will be determined by the Committee consistent with the applicable requirements\nof Section 409A of the Code.\nAwards requiring exercise will have a maximum term not to exceed ten years from the date of grant.\nEffect of a Change in Capital Structure\nIn the event of a change in capital structure, the Committee may make such proportionate and equitable\nadjustments as it may deem appropriate to reflect such change with respect to (a) the aggregate number and\ntype of shares that may be issued under the BTG Incentive Plan\u037e (b) the terms and conditions of any issued\nand outstanding awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with\nrespect thereto)\u037e and (c) the grant or exercise price per share for any issued and outstanding awards under\nthe BTG Incentive Plan.\nNumber of Awards Granted to Employees, Consultants and Directors\nAs of the date hereof, no awards have been granted under the BTG Incentive Plan.\nResolutions to be Voted Upon\nThe full text of the resolutions to be proposed is as follows:\n\u201cRESOLVED that the BTG Incentive Plan is hereby authorized and approved, to be effective immediately\nupon the consummation of the Business Combination.\u201d\nVotes Required for Approval\nThe BTG Incentive Plan Proposal will be approved and adopted only if holders of at least a majority of\nthe issued and outstanding BSGA Ordinary Shares present in person physically or by virtual attendance or\nrepresented by proxy and entitled to vote and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nBTG Incentive Plan Proposal.

This discussion does not\naddress all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their\nindividual circumstances or status, including:\nour Sponsor or any member thereof\u037e\nbanks or financial institutions\u037e\ndealers or electing traders in securities that are subject to mark-to-market tax accounting rules\u037e\ntax-exempt entities (including private foundations)\u037e\ninsurance companies\u037e\nregulated investment companies\u037e\nreal estate investment trusts\u037e\npension plans\u037e\ncooperatives\u037e\ngovernment organizations\u037e\npartnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes (and investors therein)\u037e\ncertain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States\u037e\npersons that acquired BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares as compensation\u037e\npersons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of the shares of BSGA, Bitdeer, or,\nfollowing the Business Combination, BTG, by vote or value\u037e\npersons that hold BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares, or will hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, in\nconnection with a trade or business, permanent establishment, or fixed place of business conducted\noutside the United States\u037e\npersons that hold BSGA Securities or Bitdeer Shares, or will hold BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, as\npart of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction\u037e or\nU.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nIf a partnership (or any entity so characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Bitdeer\nShares, BSGA Securities or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, the tax treatment of such partnership and its\npartners will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership.\nPartnerships holding any Bitdeer Shares, BSGA Securities or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares and their partners\nshould consult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business\nCombination, ownership and disposition of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, or the exercise of redemption\nrights with respect to the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares.\nThis discussion is based on the Code, proposed, temporary and final Treasury regulations promulgated\nunder the Code, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. All of the\n169 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nforegoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax\nconsiderations described herein. This discussion does not address alternative minimum or Medicare\ncontribution tax considerations, the special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code or U.S.\nfederal taxes other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income taxation (such as estate or gift taxes), nor\ndoes it address any aspects of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxation.\nWe have not and do not intend to seek any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d)\nregarding any aspect of the Business Combination or the exercise of redemption rights. There can be no\nassurance that the IRS will not take positions that are inconsistent with those discussed below or that any\nsuch positions would not be sustained by a court.\nAs used herein, the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a person that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a\nbeneficial owner of BSGA Securities, Bitdeer Shares, or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received pursuant to\nthe Business Combination and is:\na citizen or individual resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia\u037e or\nan estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its\nsource.\nTHIS SUMMARY DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF\nALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION.\nHOLDERS OF BSGA SECURITIES OR BITDEER SHARES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS\nREGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION\nAND OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF BTG CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES AFTER THE\nBUSINESS COMBINATION, OR THE REDEMPTION OF THEIR BSGA CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES,\nINCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX\nLAWS.\nConsequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities\nSubject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth in this section entitled \u201c-\nConsequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities,\u201d in the opinion of Davis\nPolk & Wardwell LLP, the following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business\nCombination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities. As used in this section entitled \u201c-Consequences of the\nBusiness Combination to U.S. Holders of BSGA Securities,\u201d the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a U.S. Holder of\nBSGA Securities.\nSeparation of a BSGA Unit\nNo statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of an instrument such\nas a Unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The\nseparation of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Share and BSGA Right comprising a BSGA Unit should not be a\ntaxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because there are no authorities that directly\naddress instruments that are similar to the BSGA Units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court will\nagree with the characterization described above.\nConversion of a BSGA Right into BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares\nNo statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of instruments similar\nto the BSGA Rights for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear.\nWhile we believe that a U.S. Holder of BSGA Rights should not be required to recognize gain or loss upon\nthe receipt of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the conversion of the BSGA Rights, no assurance\ncan be given that the IRS or a court will agree with this treatment. If this treatment is respected, the tax basis\nof BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares acquired by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the terms of the BSGA Rights\nshould be equal to the U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the relevant ten BSGA Rights with respect to which the\nshare was issued. The holding period of such BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares should begin on the day after\nthe\n170 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconversion of the BSGA Rights into such BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares. U.S. Holders of BSGA Rights that\ndo not receive BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares with respect thereto (because they hold fewer than ten BSGA\nRights) should consult their tax advisers regarding their ability to claim a loss with respect to such non-\nconverted BSGA Rights.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, the term \u201cBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares,\u201d as used in the\nremainder of this discussion, includes any BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares a U.S. Holder receives upon the\nconversion of such holder\u2019s BSGA Rights in connection with the consummation of the Business\nCombination.\nQualification of the Initial Mergers as a Reorganization\nThe Initial Mergers should be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d described in Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code\n(an \u201cF Reorganization\u201d). However, there is no assurance that the IRS or any court will agree with this\nposition. U.S. Holders should be aware that the completion of the Business Combination is not conditioned\non the receipt of an opinion of counsel that the Initial Mergers (or any other aspect of the Business\nCombination) qualify as tax-free transactions. Neither BSGA nor BTG has requested or will request a ruling\nfrom the IRS with respect to any aspect of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination.\nAssuming that the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization:\na U.S. Holder that exchanges its BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Initial Mergers\ngenerally will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of such BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for\nBTG Class A Ordinary Shares,\nthe adjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received as a result of the\nInitial Mergers will equal the adjusted tax basis of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares surrendered in\nexchange therefor, and\na U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the exchange will include\nthe holding period in the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.\nThe exchange of BSGA Rights for BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, which in turn are exchanged for BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares, should also be a tax-free transaction to U.S. Holders of BSGA Rights, but it is\npossible that the IRS could take the position that such transactions are taxable to holders of BSGA Rights,\neven if the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization with respect to U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A\nOrdinary Shares.\nIf the Initial Mergers do not qualify as an F Reorganization, the tax consequences of the Initial Mergers\nwill depend on whether the Initial Mergers or any component thereof would qualify for tax-free treatment\nunder other provisions of the Code, and may be affected by BSGA\u2019s PFIC status and whether BTG is also a\nPFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe Initial Mergers if they do not qualify as an F Reorganization or otherwise as tax-free transactions\n(including the requirement to recognize gain in that event). In addition, U.S. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisers regarding whether the PFIC rules could apply to the transfer of their BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares\npursuant to the Initial Mergers if they do not qualify as an F Reorganization (regardless of whether the Initial\nMergers otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment).\nBecause the Initial Mergers will occur prior to the redemption of U.S. Holders that exercise redemption\nrights, U.S. Holders exercising such redemption rights will be subject to the potential tax consequences of\nthe Initial Mergers described above, and the PFIC rules described below will apply to any income or gain or\nrecognized with respect to the redemption. All U.S. Holders considering exercising redemption rights are\nurged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the potential tax consequences to them of the Initial\nMergers and an exercise of redemption rights.\nThe remainder of this disclosure assumes the Initial Mergers qualify as an F Reorganization.\nEffect of the Acquisition Merger\nThe implementation of the subsequent Acquisition Merger should not have an adverse effect on the\nU.S. federal income tax treatment of the exchange of BSGA Securities by U.S. Holders and accordingly, the\nBusiness Combination as a whole should be a nontaxable transaction to them for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\n171 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nConsequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer Shares\nSubject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations set forth in this section entitled \u201c-\nConsequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer Shares,\u201d the following are the material\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer Shares. As\nused in this section entitled \u201c-Consequences of the Business Combination to U.S. Holders of Bitdeer\nShares,\u201d the term \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a U.S. Holder of Bitdeer Shares.\nQualification of the Acquisition Merger as a Reorganization\nThe Acquisition Merger is intended to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d described in Section 368(a) of the\nCode (a \u201cReorganization\u201d). In connection with the effectiveness of this registration statement of which this\nproxy statement/prospectus is a part, Cooley LLP, counsel to Bitdeer, will issue an opinion to Bitdeer that the\nAcquisition Merger should qualify as a Reorganization (the \u201cCooley opinion\u201d). The Cooley opinion is\nprospective, dependent on future events, and based on customary assumptions and representations from\nBitdeer, BSGA, and BTG, as well as certain covenants and undertakings by Bitdeer, BSGA, BTG, and their\nrespective affiliates (together, the \u201ctax opinion representations and assumptions\u201d). If any of the tax opinion\nrepresentations and assumptions are incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate, or are violated, the validity of the\nCooley opinion may be affected, and the tax consequences of the Acquisition Merger could differ from those\ndescribed herein. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, but it is not binding on\nthe IRS or any court and there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the Acquisition Merger\u2019s\nqualification as a Reorganization or that a court will not sustain such a challenge. U.S. Holders should be\naware that the completion of the Business Combination is not conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of\ncounsel that the Acquisition Merger (or any other aspect of the Business Combination) qualifies as a tax-free\ntransaction. Further, Bitdeer has not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the IRS with respect to\nany aspect of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination.\nAssuming that the Acquisition Merger qualifies as a Reorganization:\na U.S. Holder that exchanges its Bitdeer Shares pursuant to the Business Combination generally will\nnot recognize gain or loss on the exchange of such Bitdeer Shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares,\nthe adjusted tax basis of a U.S. Holder in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received as a result of the\nBusiness Combination generally will equal the adjusted tax basis of the Bitdeer Shares surrendered in\nexchange therefor, and\na U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the exchange generally will\ninclude the holding period in the Bitdeer Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.\nIf the Acquisition Merger does not qualify as a Reorganization or any other tax-free transaction under\nthe Code, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the fair\nmarket value of the amount realized in the Acquisition Merger and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the\nBitdeer Shares exchanged therefor. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be\nlong-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in the Bitdeer Shares exceeds one year at\nthe time of the Acquisition Merger. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. Holders currently are\neligible for preferential tax rates, while the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The U.S.\nHolder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the Acquisition Merger generally\nwill be equal to their fair market value at the time of the Acquisition Merger, and the U.S. Holder\u2019s holding\nperiod in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received in the Acquisition Merger generally will commence on\nthe day following the Acquisition Merger. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the Acquisition Merger if it does not qualify as a Reorganization or any\nother tax-free transaction under the Code (including the requirement to recognize gain in that event). In\naddition, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding whether the PFIC rules could apply to the\ntransfer of their Bitdeer Shares pursuant to the Acquisition Merger if it does not qualify as a Reorganization\n(regardless of whether the Acquisition Merger otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment).\nConsequences of Ownership and Disposition of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\nTaxation of Distributions\nThe following discussion is subject to the discussion below under \u201c\u202f-\u202fPassive Foreign Investment\nCompany Rules.\u201d\n172 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as dividend income the amount of\nany distribution paid on BTG Class A Ordinary Shares to the extent the distribution is paid out of BTG\u2019s\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) on the\nday actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder. Because BTG may not maintain calculations of\nearnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that the full amount of\ndistributions (if any) paid by BTG will be reported as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nDividends received on BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will not be eligible for the dividends received\ndeduction generally allowed to corporations. Dividends received by certain other non-corporate U.S.\nHolders of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to tax at the lower capital gain tax rate currently\napplicable to \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including that BTG\nis not a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding year and certain holding\nperiod and other requirements are met. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the BSGA\nClass A Ordinary Shares may prevent the holding period from commencing prior to the termination of such\nrights. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the availability of such lower rate on\ndividends generally and in their particular circumstances.\nGain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\nThe following discussion is subject to the discussion below under \u201c\u202f-\u202fPassive Foreign Investment\nCompany Rules.\u201d\nA U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of\nBTG Class A Ordinary Shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the\ndisposition and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, each determined\nin U.S. dollars. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.\nHolder\u2019s holding period for such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares exceeds one year. Long-term capital gain\nrealized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder is currently eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deduction of\ncapital losses is subject to certain limitations.\nConsequences of a Redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares\nThe following discussion is subject to the discussion below under \u201c\u202f-\u202fPassive Foreign Investment\nCompany Rules.\u201d\nIn the event that a U.S. Holder\u2019s BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares are redeemed pursuant to the\nredemption provisions described in this proxy statement/prospectus under \u201cExtraordinary General Meeting\nof BSGA Shareholders\u202f-\u202fRedemption Rights,\u201d the treatment of the redemption for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes will generally depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the BSGA Class A Ordinary\nShares under Section 302 of the Code (in which case such redemption would be treated as described above\nunder the heading \u201c\u202f-\u202fGain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares\u201d) or rather as a distribution, in which case such redemption would be treated as described in\n\u201c\u202f-\u202fTaxation of Distributions\u201d  (except that the preferential rate for qualified dividend income will not apply).\nGenerally, whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of\nBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any shares constructively\nowned by the U.S. Holder described in the following paragraph) relative to all BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares\noutstanding both before and after such redemption (and treating BTG Class A Ordinary Shares as BSGA\nClass A Ordinary Shares for this purpose). The redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares generally will\nbe treated as a sale of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (rather than as a corporate distribution) if such\nredemption (i) is \u201csubstantially disproportionate\u201d with respect to the U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a \u201ccomplete\ntermination\u201d of the U.S. Holder\u2019s interest in us or (iii) is \u201cnot essentially equivalent to a dividend\u201d with\nrespect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\nIn determining whether any of the tests are satisfied, a U.S. Holder generally takes into account not only\nBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also any BSGA Class A Ordinary\nShares that are constructively owned by such U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in\naddition to shares owned directly, shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S.\nHolder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any shares the U.S. Holder has\na right to\n173 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nacquire by exercise of an option. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of\nour outstanding voting shares (including the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares and the BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares received in exchange therefor) actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately\nfollowing the redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares must, among other requirements, be less than\n80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S.\nHolder immediately before the redemption. Before the Business Combination, the BSGA Class A Ordinary\nShares may not be treated as voting shares for this purpose and, consequently, this substantially\ndisproportionate test may not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder\u2019s interest if\neither (i) all BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are\nredeemed or (ii) all BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the\nU.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of\nshares owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other shares\nof ours. The redemption of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will not be essentially equivalent to a\ndividend with respect to a U.S. Holder if it results in a \u201cmeaningful reduction\u201d of the U.S. Holder\u2019s\nproportionate interest in BSGA. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S.\nHolder\u2019s proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS\nhas indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small\nminority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may\nconstitute such a \u201cmeaningful reduction.\u201d\nIf none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption will be treated as a corporate distribution\nand taxed in the manner described above under \u201c\u202f-\u202fTaxation of Distributions\u201d  (except that the preferential\nrate for qualified dividend income will not apply). After the application of those rules, any remaining tax\nbasis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will be added to the U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis in its remaining shares, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in other\nshares constructively owned by such U.S. Holder.\nAny income or gain recognized with respect to the redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares will be\nsubject to the PFIC rules described below.\nU.S. HOLDERS OF BSGA CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES CONTEMPLATING THE EXERCISE OF THEIR\nREDEMPTION RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL,\nSTATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES THEREOF.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nThe treatment of U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares and BTG Class A Ordinary Shares\ncould be (and generally will be, in the case of U.S. Holders of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares) materially\ndifferent from that described above due to the application of the PFIC rules.\nIn general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in\nwhich (i) 50% or more of the value of its assets (generally determined on the basis of a weighted quarterly\naverage) consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income, or (ii) 75% or\nmore of its gross income consists of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest,\nroyalties, rents, investment gains, net gains from the sales of property that does not give rise to any income\nand net gains from the sale of commodities (subject to certain exceptions, such as an exception for certain\nincome derived in the active conduct of a trade or business). Cash and cash equivalents are, and\ncryptocurrency balances are likely, passive assets. The value of goodwill will generally be treated as an\nactive or passive asset based on the nature of the income produced in the activity to which the goodwill is\nattributable. For purposes of the PFIC rules, a non-U.S. corporation that owns, directly or indirectly, at least\n25% by value of the stock of another corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of the assets\nof the other corporation, and received directly its proportionate share of the income of the other corporation.\nPursuant to the start-up exception, a corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the\ncorporation has gross income (the \u201cstart-up year\u201d), if (1) no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC, (2) it\nis established to the satisfaction of the IRS that the corporation will not be a PFIC for either of the first two\ntaxable years following the start-up year, and (3) the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years\n(the \u201cstart-up exception\u201d). BSGA believes that it did not qualify for the start-up exception for its taxable year\nended December 31, 2021. Therefore, because BSGA is a blank-check company with no current active\n174 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusiness, based on the composition of BSGA\u2019s income and assets, BSGA believes that it was a PFIC for its\ntaxable years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.\nFurthermore, the PFIC status of BSGA may affect the PFIC status of BTG for BTG\u2019s taxable year ending\nDecember 31, 2023 because BTG should be treated as the same corporation as BSGA for purposes of the\nPFIC rules. Depending on the closing date of the Business Combination and the composition of BTG\u2019s\nincome and assets and the estimated value of BTG\u2019s assets, including goodwill, BTG may be a PFIC for its\ntaxable year ending December 31, 2023. BTG\u2019s PFIC status for any taxable year is a factual annual\ndetermination that can be made only after the end of that year and will depend on the composition of BTG\u2019s\nincome and assets and the value of its assets from time to time (including the value of its goodwill, which\nmay be determined in large part by reference to the market price of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares from\ntime to time, which could be volatile) and, for the taxable year in which the Business Combination occurs, the\nincome and assets, and the value of the assets, of its predecessor BSGA. In addition, the risk of BTG being a\nPFIC for any taxable year will increase if its market capitalization declines substantially during that year.\nFurthermore, whether and to which extent BTG\u2019s income and assets, including goodwill, will be characterized\nas active or passive will depend on various factors that are subject to uncertainty, including BTG\u2019s future\nbusiness plan and the application of laws that are subject to varying interpretation. For example, there is no\nauthority that directly addresses the proper treatment of certain items of BTG\u2019s income, such as income from\nproprietary cryptocurrency mining, hash rate sharing, or hosting for purposes of the PFIC rules and,\nalthough BTG currently treats these items of income as active, such treatment is uncertain. Moreover, certain\nof BTG\u2019s business activities generate passive income and, although the amount of such income is currently\nsmall, BTG\u2019s risk of being a PFIC will increase if the proportion of BTG\u2019s revenue earned from such business\nactivities increases in future taxable years. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that BTG will not be a\nPFIC for its current or any future taxable year.\nEven if BTG is not a PFIC for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023, or any subsequent taxable year,\nif BSGA is or was a PFIC (as BSGA believes to be the case for its 2021 and 2022 taxable years, and which may\nbe the case for its 2023 taxable year) for any taxable year during the holding period of a U.S. Holder in its\nBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, and such U.S. Holder did not (or could not) make any of the PFIC Elections\n(as defined below), although not free from doubt, BTG would be treated as a PFIC as to a U.S. Holder who\nexchanges BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares in connection with the Initial\nMergers with respect to such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, unless such U.S. Holder makes a purging\nelection with respect to its shares. Under one type of purging election, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to\nhave sold such shares at their fair market value and any gain recognized on such deemed sale will be treated\nas an \u201cexcess distribution,\u201d as described below. As a result of this election, the U.S. Holder will have\nadditional basis (to the extent of any gain recognized in the deemed sale) and, solely for purposes of the\nPFIC rules, a new holding period in such holder\u2019s BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. In the absence of a purging\nelection, such U.S. Holder would be treated for purposes of the PFIC rules as if it held such BTG Class A\nOrdinary Shares for a period that includes its holding period for the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares\nexchanged therefor. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the\npurging elections rules to their particular circumstances.\nIn addition, any income or gain recognized by a U.S. Holder electing to have its BSGA Class A Ordinary\nShares redeemed, as described above under the heading \u201c\u202f-\u202fConsequences of Ownership and Disposition of\nBTG Class A Ordinary Shares\u202f-\u202fConsequences of a Redemption of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares,\u201d would\ngenerally be subject to a special tax and interest charge if such U.S. Holder did not make a qualified electing\nfund (\u201cQEF\u201d) election for BSGA\u2019s first taxable year as a PFIC in which such U.S. Holder held (or was deemed\nto hold) such shares, a QEF election along with an applicable purging election, or a mark-to-market election\n(collectively, the \u201cPFIC Elections\u201d).\nIf BTG is a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owns BTG Class A Ordinary Shares and\nany entity in which it owns equity interests is also a PFIC (a \u201cLower-tier PFIC\u201d), the U.S. Holder will be\ndeemed to own their proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of each Lower-tier PFIC and will be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax according to the rules described above on (i) certain distributions by a\nLower-tier PFIC and (ii) dispositions of shares of Lower-tier PFICs, in each case as if the U.S. Holders held\nsuch shares directly, even though the U.S. Holders will not receive any proceeds of those distributions or\ndispositions.\n175 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf BSGA or BTG is a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period\nof a U.S. Holder of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or other\ndisposition (including certain pledges) of its BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be allocated ratably over the\nU.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for such BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. The amounts allocated to the taxable\nyear of the sale or disposition and to any year before BTG became a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income.\nThe amount allocated to each other taxable year will be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for\nindividuals or corporations, as applicable, for that taxable year, and an interest charge will be imposed on the\nresulting tax liability for each such year. Furthermore, to the extent that distributions received by a U.S.\nHolder in any taxable year on its BTG Class A Ordinary Shares exceed 125% of the average of the annual\ndistributions on the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received during the preceding three taxable years or the\nU.S. Holder\u2019s holding period, whichever is shorter, the excess distributions will be subject to taxation in the\nsame manner.\nIn general, a U.S. Holder of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares may avoid the adverse PFIC tax\nconsequences described above in respect of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares if it has made and maintains a\ntimely and valid QEF election to include in income its pro rata share of BSGA\u2019s (and its successor BTG\u2019s) net\ncapital gains (as long-term capital gains) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current\nbasis, in each case, whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which\nBSGA\u2019s (or its successor BTG\u2019s) taxable year ends. In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF\nelection, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC Annual Information Statement from BSGA or BTG, as the case\nmay be. BSGA will endeavor to make available to U.S. Holders a PFIC Annual Information Statement, upon\nrequest, with respect to its taxable year ended December 31, 2022. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder of\nBSGA Rights is entitled to make a QEF election with respect to the BSGA Rights. Under proposed Treasury\nregulations, for purposes of the PFIC rules, the holding period of BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares received\nwith respect to BSGA Rights (and the holding period of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares received with respect\nthereto) could include the holding period for the Rights. Therefore, assuming a QEF election is not available\nwith respect to the BSGA Rights, a U.S. Holder of BSGA Rights may be subject to the general PFIC rules\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph with respect to the shares underlying the BSGA Rights, even if the U.S.\nHolder made a QEF election with respect to its other BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares, unless a purging\nelection is made. U.S. Holders of BSGA Rights should consult their tax advisers regarding whether and how\nthe PFIC rules apply to their BSGA Rights or the underlying BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares.\nAlternatively, if a U.S. Holder owns shares in a company that is a PFIC and the shares are \u201cregularly\ntraded\u201d on a \u201cqualified exchange,\u201d such U.S. Holder could make a mark-to-market election that would result\nin tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above. The BSGA Class A\nOrdinary Shares and BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be treated as regularly traded for any calendar year in\nwhich more than a de minimis quantity of the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares or BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares, as applicable, are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter.\nNasdaq, where the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares are listed and the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares are\nexpected to be listed, is a qualified exchange for this purpose. If a U.S. Holder makes (or has made) the mark-\nto-market election for the first taxable year of BSGA or BTG in which it is or was treated as a PFIC with\nrespect to such U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder generally will recognize as ordinary income any excess of the fair\nmarket value of the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares at the end of each taxable year over their adjusted tax\nbasis, and will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the BTG Class\nA Ordinary Shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net\namount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes the\nmark-to-market election, the U.S. Holder\u2019s tax basis in the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be adjusted to\nreflect the income or loss amounts recognized. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares in a year in which BTG is a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will\nbe treated as an ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a\nresult of the mark-to-market election, with any excess treated as capital loss). If a U.S. Holder makes the\nmark-to-market election, distributions paid on BTG Class A Ordinary Shares will be treated as discussed\nunder \u201c\u202f-\u202fTaxation of Distributions\u201d above. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the\navailability and advisability of making a mark-to-market election in their particular circumstances. U.S.\nHolders should note that there is no provision in the Code, Treasury regulations or other official IRS\nguidance that would give them the right to make a mark-to-market election with respect to any Lower-tier\nPFIC, the shares of which are not regularly traded, and, therefore, the general rules applicable to ownership\nof a PFIC\n176 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndescribed above could continue to apply to a U.S. Holder with respect to any Lower-tier PFIC of BTG, even if\nthe U.S. Holder made a mark-to-market election with respect to the BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nIf BTG is (or is treated with respect to a particular U.S. Holder as) a PFIC for any taxable year during\nwhich a U.S. Holder owns any BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in\napplicable Treasury regulations, the U.S. Holder will be required to file annual reports with the IRS with\nrespect to BTG and any Lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the\ndetermination of whether BSGA or BTG is a PFIC for any taxable year and the potential application of the\nPFIC rules to their ownership of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nU.S. Holders that exchange their Bitdeer Shares for BTG Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the\nBusiness Combination are required to retain permanent records pertaining to the Acquisition Merger and\nmake such records available to any authorized IRS officers and employees. Additionally, such U.S. Holders\nthat, immediately before the completion of the Acquisition Merger, own at least 1% (by vote or value) of\nBitdeer capital stock or, in certain instances, Bitdeer \u201csecurities\u201d with a basis of at least US$1 million are\nrequired to attach a statement to their U.S. federal income tax returns for the taxable year in which the\nAcquisition Merger is completed containing certain information prescribed by applicable Treasury\nregulations.\nPayments of dividends and sales (including redemption) proceeds that are made within the United\nStates or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting and\nbackup withholding, unless (i) the U.S. Holder is a corporation or other \u201cexempt recipient\u201d or (ii) in the case\nof backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it\nis not subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a\nU.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a\nrefund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain U.S. Holders who are\nindividuals (and certain specified entities) may be required to report information relating to their ownership\nof BSGA Securities, Bitdeer Shares or BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, or non-U.S. accounts through which\nthey are held.\nU.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to their\nBSGA Securities, Bitdeer Shares and BTG Class A Ordinary Shares.\nBritish Virgin Islands Tax Considerations\nUnder the BVI Companies Act, BSGA is exempt from all forms of BVI taxes\u037e all dividends, interest,\nroyalties and other amounts payable by BSGA, and any gain realized on any shares, debt obligations or\nother securities of BSGA, are exempt from BVI taxes\u037e and no BVI estate, inheritance, succession or gift taxes\nare payable with respect to any shares, debt obligations or other securities of BSGA.\nConsequently, the Initial Mergers will not give rise to any material BVI tax consequences for BSGA or\nthe holders of their BSGA Ordinary Shares.\nCayman Islands Tax Considerations\nThe following summary contains a description of certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of\nthe acquisition, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive\ndescription of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase ordinary shares. The\nsummary is based upon the tax laws of Cayman Islands and regulations thereunder as of the date hereof,\nwhich are subject to change.\nProspective investors should consult their professional advisers on the possible tax consequences of\nbuying, holding or selling any shares under the laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.\nThe following is a discussion on certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of an investment in\nthe BTG Class A Ordinary Shares. The discussion is a general summary of present law, which is subject to\n177 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nprospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor\u2019s\nparticular circumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman\nIslands law.\nUnder Existing Cayman Islands Laws:\nPayments of dividends and capital in respect of BTG Securities will not be subject to taxation in the\nCayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of interest and principal or a dividend or\ncapital to any holder of BTG Class A Ordinary Shares, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the BTG\nClass A Ordinary Shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax. The Cayman Islands\ncurrently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of BTG Securities or on an instrument of transfer in\nrespect of a BTG Security.\nBTG has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited\nliability and, as such, has applied for and expects to obtain / obtained an undertaking from the Governor in\nCabinet of the Cayman Islands in the following form:\nThe Tax Concessions Law\nUndertaking as to Tax Concessions\nIn accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, BTG\nplans to apply an undertaking from the Governor in Cabinet:\n(a) that no law which is hereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on\nprofits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to BSGA or its operations\u037e and\n(b) in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the\nnature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable:\n(i) on or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of BSGA\u037e or\n(ii) by way of the withholding in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section\n6(3) of the Tax Concessions Law.\nThese concessions shall be for a period of TWENTY years from the date of such undertaking.\nThe Cayman Islands currently levy no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income,\ngains or appreciations and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no\nother taxes likely to be material to BTG levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands save certain stamp\nduties which may be applicable, from time to time, on certain instruments executed in or brought within the\njurisdiction of the Cayman Islands.\n178 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nINFORMATION RELATED TO BSGA\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or\n\u201cour\u201d refer to BSGA prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.\nOverview\nBSGA was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on February 23, 2021, and was formed for the\npurpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or\nsimilar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company originally had until June 14, 2022\nto consummate a Business Combination, subject to extensions of up to two times, each by an additional\nthree months (for a total of up to 18 months). BSGA has elected to effectuate such two extensions, as a result\nof which the deadline for consummating its initial business combination has been extended to December 14,\n2022. On December 5, 2022, BSGA held an extraordinary general meeting at which its shareholders approved\nthe extension of the date by which BSGA has to consummate a business combination up to four (4) times for\nan additional three months each time from December 14, 2022 to December 14, 2023. In order to extend the\ntime available for BSGA to consummate an initial business combination, BSGA is committed to depositing\nUS$0.15 for each BSGA Public Share that has not been redeemed into the Trust Account for each three-\nmonth extension. In connection with the extension of business combination period, US$41.99 million was\nreleased from the Trust Account to satisfy the redemptions. BSGA made two deposits in total of\nUS$515,516.40 to the Trust Account and extended the date by which BSGA has to complete a business\ncombination from December 14, 2022 to June 14, 2023. Following such redemptions and the deposit, the\namount of funds remaining in the Trust Account is approximately US$18.6 million.\nIf BSGA is unable to complete its initial business combination by June 14, 2023 or by the applicable\ndeadline as may be extended by BSGA up to December 14, 2023 pursuant to the Existing BSGA Articles (or a\nlater date approved by its shareholders) (the \u201cCombination Deadline\u201d), it will: (i) cease all operations except\nfor the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days\nthereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price,\npayable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest\nearned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to pay its taxes or to fund its\nworking capital requirements (less up to US$50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the\nnumber of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019\nrights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to\napplicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the\napproval of its remaining shareholders and board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to\nits obligations under BVI law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThere will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Private Placement Units,\nwhich will expire worthless if BSGA fails to complete its initial business combination within the time period\nfor consummating a business combination as set forth under the BSGA Existing Articles.\nOffering Proceeds Held in Trust\nOn June 14, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 5,000,000 BSGA Units, at US$10.00 per Unit, generating\ngross proceeds of US$50,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of\n292,500 Private Placement Units in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of\nUS$2,925,000. The underwriters exercised their over-allotment option simultaneously with the IPO for an\nadditional 750,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of US$10.00 per Unit, generating gross\nproceeds of US$7,500,000.\nFollowing the closing of our IPO, an amount of US$58,075,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the\nUnits our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in the Trust Account which is invested\nin U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-\nended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7\nof the Investment Company Act, as determined by use, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a\nbusiness combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account.\n181 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a total of approximately US$59.6 million and US$58.1\nmillion, respectively, of the net proceeds from the sale of the units in the IPO (including the over-allotment\nunits), the private placements, and the extension payments to extend the time available for the Company to\nconsummate the initial Business Combination were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of\nthe Company\u2019s public shareholders with Continental acting as trustee.\nBusiness Combination Activities\nOn December 15, 2021, the Merger Agreement was entered into by and among BTG, Bitdeer, BSGA,\nBSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger Sub 2, Bitdeer Merger Sub and BSGA Sub, amending and restating the\nagreement and plan of merger dated November 18, 2021, by and among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) BSGA Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into BSGA with\nBSGA being the surviving entity, (ii) immediately following the First SPAC Merger, BSGA will merge with and\ninto BSGA Merger Sub 2, with BSGA Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity, and (iii) following the Initial\nMergers, Bitdeer Merger Sub will merge with and into Bitdeer, with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and\nbecoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG. The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement are collectively referred to as the Business Combination. The consummation of the\nBusiness Combination remains subject to customary closing conditions.\nRedemption Rights\nPursuant to BSGA Existing Articles, our shareholders (except the Initial Shareholders) will be entitled to\nredeem their public shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account (currently anticipated to be no less than\napproximately US$10.87 per ordinary share), net of taxes payable. The Initial Shareholders do not have\nredemption rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly.\nAutomatic Dissolution and Subsequent Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination\nIf BSGA does not complete a business combination within by the Combination Deadline, it will trigger\nthe automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of its Articles of Association.\nThe occurrence of such an event has the same effect as if BSGA had formally gone through a voluntary\nliquidation procedure under BVI law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from BSGA Shareholders to\ncommence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. If BSGA is unable to consummate its\ninitial business combination within such time period, it will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten\nbusiness days thereafter, redeem 100% of BSGA\u2019s outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the\nfunds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the\nTrust Account and not necessary to pay its taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. In the event of its\ndissolution and liquidation, the rights of BSGA will expire and will be worthless.\nThe proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors\nthat are in preference to the claims of our public shareholders. Although BSGA will seek to have all vendors,\nservice providers (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target\nbusinesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,\ninterest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public\nshareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such\nagreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including, but not\nlimited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims\nchallenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a\nclaim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute\nan agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, BSGA will perform an analysis of\nthe alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a\nwaiver if management believes that such third-party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to\nus than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to\nexecute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are\nbelieved by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to\nexecute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a\nwaiver.\n182 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMaxim Group LLC, the underwriter in BSGA\u2019s IPO, has not executed agreements with us waiving such\nclaims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that entities will agree to\nwaive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or\nagreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect\nthe amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent\nany claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with\nwhich we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to\nbelow the lesser of (i) US$10.87 per Unit and (ii) the actual amount per Unit held in the Trust Account as of\nthe date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than US$10.87 per share due to reductions in the\nvalue of the Trust Assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any\nclaims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor\nwill it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of IPO against certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such\nindemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to\nsatisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of BSGA.\nTherefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our\nofficers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by\nvendors and prospective target businesses.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) US$10.87 per\nUnit and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of\nthe Trust Account is less than US$10.87 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each\ncase less taxes payable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or\nthat it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would\ndetermine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While\nBSGA currently expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against Sponsor\nto enforce its indemnification obligations to BSGA, it is possible that BSGA\u2019s independent directors in\nexercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, BSGA\ncannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not\nbe less than US$10.87 per Unit.\nIf BSGA files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not\ndismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may\nbe included in its bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of\nour public shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure\nyou we will be able to return US$10.87 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a\nbankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any\ndistributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy\nlaws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could\nseek to recover some or all amounts received by our public shareholders. Furthermore, our Board may be\nviewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and\nthereby exposing itself and BSGA to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the\nTrust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be\nbrought against us for these reasons.\nEach of the Initial Shareholders has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of the\nTrust Account or other assets with respect to the Private Placement Units they held.\nFacilities\nWe maintain our principal executive offices at The Sun\u2019s Group Center, 29 Floor, 200 Gloucester Road,\nWan Chai, Hong Kong. An affiliate of our Sponsor is providing this space for a fee of US$10,000 per month.\nWe consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\nEmployees\nBSGA has two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of\nhours to its matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to its affairs. BSGA\u2019s\nexecutive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to BSGA\u2019s\nbusiness. BSGA does not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business\ncombination.\n183 \n",

This duty\nhas been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge,\nskill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are\ncarried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which\nthat director has.\nAs set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes\na duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some\ninstances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by\nthe shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of\npermission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by\nshareholder approval at general meetings.\nEach of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers\nmay have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or\ndirector is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his\nor her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an\nacquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or\ncontractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present\nsuch acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, subject to his or her\nfiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity\noffered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or\nher capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and\ncontractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe,\nhowever, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially\nundermine our ability to complete our business combination.\nOur Sponsor, officers and directors may become officers or directors of other special purpose\nacquisition companies. Notwithstanding that, such officers and directors will continue to have a pre-existing\nfiduciary obligation to us and we will, therefore, have priority over any special purpose acquisition\ncompanies they subsequently join. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential\nconflicts of interest:\nNone of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and,\naccordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business\nactivities.\nIn the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of\ninvestment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the\nother entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in\n188 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndetermining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. For a complete\ndescription of our management\u2019s other affiliations, see \u201c- Directors and Officers.\u201d\nOur Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to our\nFounder Shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business\ncombination. Additionally, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption\nrights with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination\nwithin 12 months after the closing of this offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of this offering\nif we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). If\nwe do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds\nof the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption\nof our public shares and rights will expire worthless. With certain limited exceptions, the Founder\nShares will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor until the earlier of (1) six months\nafter the completion of our initial business combination and (2) the date on which we consummate a\nliquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization, or other similar transaction after our initial\nbusiness combination that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their\nordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale\nprice of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds US$12.00 per share (as adjusted for share\nsplits, share capitalizations, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the\nlike) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our initial business\ncombination, the Founder Shares will be released from the lock-up. With certain limited exceptions,\nthe private placement units, private placement shares, private placement rights and the Class A\nordinary shares underlying such rights will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor\nuntil 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our Sponsor and officers\nand directors may directly or indirectly own ordinary shares and rights following this offering, our\nofficers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target\nbusiness is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.\nGiven the difference between (i) the purchase price that the Sponsor paid for the Founder Shares, and\n(ii) the price of the Public Shares, and considering the substantial number of BTG Class A Ordinary\nShares that the Sponsor will receive upon conversion of the Founder Shares, the Sponsor can earn a\npositive return on their investment, even if other BSGA shareholders have a negative return on their\ninvestment in BTG.\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular\nbusiness combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included\nby a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.\nThe conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and\ndirectors have certain interests in the Business Combination, which may create actual or potential conflicts\nof interest, and these interests are, to the extent material, described in the section entitled \u201cThe Business\nCombination Proposal\u202f-\u202fInterests of BSGA Directors and Officers in the Business Combination.\u201d The\nforegoing interests present a risk that the Sponsor, BSGA\u2019s officers and directors, and their affiliates will\nbenefit from the completion of a business combination, including in a manner that may not be aligned with\nthe Public Shareholders. As such, the Sponsor and BSGA\u2019s officers and directors may be incentivized to\ncomplete a business combination with a less favorable target company or on terms less favorable to Public\nShareholders rather than to liquidate.\nAccordingly, if any of the above officers or directors become aware of a business combination\nopportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or\ncontractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such\nbusiness combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the\nopportunity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law. We do not believe,\nhowever, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will materially affect our ability\nto complete our initial business combination, because the specific industry focuses of a majority of these\nentities differ from our focus on consumer/lifestyle businesses and the type or size of the transaction that\nsuch companies would most likely consider are of a size and nature substantially different than what we are\ntargeting.\n189 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated\nwith our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination\nwith such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an\nindependent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions\nfor the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial\nbusiness combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nIn the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our\nSponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us,\nto vote any Founder Shares held by them (and their permitted transferees will agree) and any public shares\npurchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination.\nLimitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nBVI law does not limit the extent to which a company\u2019s articles of association may provide for\nindemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any provision providing indemnification may be\nheld by the BVI courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud\nor the consequences of committing a crime. Under our memorandum and articles of association, we indemnify\nagainst all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement\nand reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings for any person\nwho:\nis or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed\nproceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the\nperson is or was our director\u037e or\nis or was, at our request, serving as a director or officer of, or in any other capacity is or was acting\nfor, another body corporate or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprises.\nThese indemnities only apply if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to our best\ninterests and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his\nconduct was unlawful.\nThis standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation\nLaw for a Delaware corporation. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may\nbe permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have\nbeen advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the\nSecurities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nEmployment Agreements\nBSGA has not entered into any employment agreements with its executive officers, and has not made\nany agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment.\nExecutive Officers and Director Compensation\nNo executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation\nof any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing\nshareholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates prior to the consummation of a\nbusiness combination. However, such individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred\nin connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing\ndue diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket\nexpenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board\nof directors and audit committee, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged.\n190 \n",

We intend to effectuate our\ninitial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the\nprivate placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business\ncombination, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot\nassure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. Unless otherwise stated or\nunless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cour company,\u201d and \u201cBSGA\u201d refer to Blue\nSafari Group Acquisition Corp.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 18, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cOriginal Merger\nAgreement\u201d) dated November 18, 2021 by and among us, Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company\nincorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and one wholly-owned subsidiary of\nthe Company (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company\nincorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (\u201cBitdeer\u201d).\nOn December 15, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (as\namended from time to time, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Bitdeer\nTechnologies Group, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands (\u201cBTG\u201d), (iii) Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cMerger Sub 1\u201d), (iv) Blue Safari Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands\nbusiness company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cMerger Sub 2\u201d), (v) Bitdeer Merge Limited, an\nexempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cMerger Sub 3\u201d, and together with BTG, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the\n\u201cAcquisition Entities\u201d), (vi) Merger Sub, and (vii) Bitdeer, to amend and restate the Original Merger\nAgreement.\nThe Merger Agreement amended and restated the Original Merger Agreement to effect a change in\nstructure of the Business Combination without affecting any underlying economic interests, whereby (a)\nMerger Sub 1 will merge with and into our Company with us being the surviving entity (the \u201cFirst SPAC\nMerger\u201d) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG, (b) immediately following the First SPAC Merger,\nwe will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the \u201cSecond SPAC\nMerger\u201d, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the \u201cInitial Mergers\u201d), and (c) following the Initial\nMergers, Merger Sub 3 will merge with and into Bitdeer (the \u201cAcquisition Merger\u201d and together with the\nInitial Mergers, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of BTG. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein were unanimously\napproved by the boards of directors of each of us, BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger\nSub and Bitdeer.\nThe Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (Business Combination)\nare expected to be consummated after obtaining the required approval by the shareholders of our Company,\nBTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub, and Bitdeer and the satisfaction of certain\nother customary closing conditions. For more information, see the Current Report on Form 8-K dated\nDecember 15, 2021.\n191 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 30, 2022, we entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of\nMerger (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d, and the Merger Agreement as amended by such Amendment, the \u201cFirst\nAmended Merger Agreement\u201d) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and\nBitdeer, to amend the Merger Agreement. The First Amendment extends the termination date upon which\neither we or Bitdeer may terminate the Merger Agreement, from May 31, 2022 to September 1, 2022. In\naddition, pursuant to the First Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate\nprincipal amount of US$1,993,000 to us to fund any amount that may be required in order to extend the period\nof time available for us to consummate a business combination and for our working capital. Such loans will\nonly become repayable upon the closing of the Business Combination.\nOn December 2, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and\nPlan of Merger (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger\nSub and Bitdeer, to amend the Merger Agreement. The Second Amendment extends the termination date\nupon which either we or Bitdeer may terminate the Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier\nof (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the then applicable deadline for us to complete a business combination in\naccordance with our organizational documents. In addition, pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer will\nprovide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of US$2,584,141 to us to fund any\namount that may be required in order to extend the period of time available for us to consummate a business\ncombination and for our working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the closing of the\nBusiness Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we received US$2,545,800 under such loan.\nOn December 5, 2022, the holders of 4,031,612 BSGA Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their\nright to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately US$10.41505502 per share, for an\naggregate redemption amount of approximately US$41.99 million.\nOn March 7, 2023, BSGA entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and\nPlan of Merger (the \u201cThird Amendment\u201d, and the Second Amended Merger Agreement as amended by such\nThird Amendment, the \u201cThird Amended Merger Agreement\u201d) with BTG, BSGA Merger Sub 1, BSGA Merger\nSub 2, BSGA Merger Sub 3, BSGA Sub and Bitdeer. The Third Amendment revises the definition of \u201cPer\nShare Equity Value\u201d to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) US$1,180,000,000 by (ii) Bitdeer Total Shares.\nPursuant to the Third Amendment, the parties thereto also agreed to remove the American Depository Share\nstructure previously contemplated under the Second Amended Merger Agreement and instead issue\nordinary shares of BTG as considerations to be paid pursuant to the Third Amended Merger Agreement.\nResults of Operations\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Our only\nactivities from inception through December 31, 2022 were organizational activities and those necessary to\nprepare for the Initial Public Offering, and, following our initial public offering, identifying a target business\nwith which to engage in a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenue until\nafter the completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the\nform of interest income on marketable securities held after the Initial Public Offering. We expect that we will\nincur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and\nauditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing,\na Business Combination.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of US$3,917,800, which consists of operation\ncosts amounting to US$4,660,233, offset by the interest income from investments in our Trust Account of\nUS$742,433.\nFor the period from February 23, 2021 (Inception) to December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of\nUS$1,239,720, which consists of operation costs amounting to US$1,241,824, offset by the interest income\nfrom investments in our Trust Account of US$2,104.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn June 14, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 5,000,000 BSGA Units. Each BSGA Unit consists of one\nBSGA Ordinary Share and one BSGA Right to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the\n192 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsummation of an initial business combination. The BSGA Units were sold at an offering price of US$10.00\nper Unit, generating gross proceeds of US$50,000,000. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to\npurchase up to 750,000 additional BSGA Units to cover over-allotments, if any, which the underwriters\nexercised in full simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. The total aggregate issuance by us of\n5,750,000 units at a price of US$10.00 per unit resulted in a total gross proceeds of US$57,500,000.\nAs of June 14, 2021, a total of US$58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement\n(as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of BSGA\u2019s public\nshareholders. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (\u201cPrivate\nPlacement\u201d) with BSG First Euro Investment Corp., our Sponsor, of 292,500 units (the \u201cPrivate Units\u201d) at a\nprice of US$10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of US$2,925,000. The Private Units are identical\nto the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of\nthe Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration\nStatement) until 30 days after the completion of BSGA\u2019s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers\nwere granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the\nPrivate Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.\nFollowing the IPO and the sale of the Private Units, a total of US$58,075,000 was placed in the Trust\nAccount, and we had US$884,500 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related\nto the Initial Public Offering, and available for working capital purposes. We incurred US$4,158,799 in\ntransaction costs, including US$1,150,000 of underwriting fees, US$2,012,500 of deferred underwriting fees,\nthe fair value of the representative shares of US$478,857, and US$517,442 of other offering costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, there was US$1,064,156 of cash used in operating activities. Net\nloss of US$917,800 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account\namounting to US$742,433 and offset by changes in current assets and liabilities of US$3,596,077.\nFor the period from February 23, 2021 (Inception) to December 31, 2021, there was US$398,627 of cash\nused in operating activities. Net loss of US$1,239,720 was resulting from formation costs paid by the Sponsor\nof US$7,169, changes in current assets and liabilities of US$836,028, offset by interest earned on cash and\nmarketable securities held in Trust Account amounting to US$2,104.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had US$487,303 of cash on hand and working capital deficit of\nUS$6,602,257.\nThe Company expect to incur increased expenses since becoming a public company (for legal, financial\nreporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with the initial business\ncombination.\nOn June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, we deposited into our\nTrust Account an additional US$575,000 (representing US$0.10 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the\ncombination period from June 14, 2022 to September 14, 2022. On September 6, 2022, using the loan amount\nreceived to date, we deposited into our Trust Account an additional US$575,000 (representing US$0.10 per\nClass A ordinary share) to extend the period for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination from\nSeptember 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, we\ndeposited into our Trust Account an additional US$257,758.20 (representing US$0.15 per Class A ordinary\nshare) to extend the period for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination from December 14, 2022\nto March 14, 2023. On March 6, 2023, we further deposited into our Trust Account an additional\nUS$257,758.20 to extend the period for BSGA to consummate its initial business combination from March 14,\n2023 to June 14, 2023. It is uncertain that we will be able consummate a business combination by any of such\ndates. If a business combination is not consummated by the required dates, there will be a mandatory\nliquidation and subsequent dissolution. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern\nconsiderations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-15, \u201cDisclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity\u2019s\nAbility to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, and\nsubsequent dissolution, should we be unable to complete a business combination, raises substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern. If a business combination is not consummated by this date,\n193 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthere will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments have been made to the\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities should we be required to liquidate after June 14, 2023.\nBased upon the above analysis, management determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt\nabout the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial\nstatements are issued.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements\nas of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated\nentities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been\nestablished for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-\nbalance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or\ncommitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\nContractual Obligations\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term\nliabilities other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of US$10,000 for office space, utilities\nand secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on June 14, 2021 and will continue\nto incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our\nliquidation.\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public\nOffering, or US$2,012,500. The deferred fee will be payable in cash to the underwriters solely in the event\nthat we complete a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms\nof the underwriting agreement.\nPursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an aggregate\nprincipal amount of US$2,584,141 to us to fund any amount that may be required in order to extend the period\nof time available for us to consummate a business combination and for our working capital. Such loans will\nonly become repayable upon the closing of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, we received\nUS$2,545,800 under such loans.\nOn March 1, 2021, we issued a promissory note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which we may borrow up to\nan aggregate principal amount of $200,000. The promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the\ndate that we consummate the IPO of our securities or the date on which we determine not to conduct an IPO.\nThe maturity date of the promissory note was August 31, 2022, provided that we may in our sole discretion,\nand upon written notice to the Sponsor, extend such maturity date for an additional six months in the event\nthat we have not repaid in full the principal amount and accrued interest by August 31, 2022 pursuant to the\namended Promissory Note issued on May 30, 2022. On August 31, 2022, we issued an extension notice to the\nSponsor, to extend the maturity date of the Promissory Note for an additional six (6) months from August 31,\n2022 to February 28, 2023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had borrowed $200,000 under the\npromissory note.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual\nresults could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting\npolicies:\nClass A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nWe account for the BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with\nthe guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from\n194 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEquity.\u201d The BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption is classified as a liability\ninstrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares (including\nBSGA Class A Ordinary Shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder\nthereof or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is\nclassified as temporary equity. At all other times, BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares are classified as\nshareholders\u2019 equity. BSGA Class A Ordinary Shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to\nbe outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, all BSGA Class\nA Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity,\noutside of the shareholders\u2019 equity section of our balance sheet\nNet Loss Per Ordinary Share\nWe comply with the accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 260, \u201cEarnings Per Share.\u201d\nNet loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary\nshares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. We have two classes\nof shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Earnings and losses\nare shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have\nany dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary\nshares and then share in the earnings of us. As a result, diluted loss per ordinary share is the same as basic\nloss per ordinary share for the period presented. We do not believe there is significant estimation\nuncertainty and therefore we do not expect potential impact on earning per share.\n195 \n",

As of June\n30, 2022, we were the world\u2019s second largest holder of proprietary hash rate, which is defined as hash rate\ngenerated from proprietary mining machines\u037e by allocating part of our proprietary hash rate for sale, we were\nthe world\u2019s largest supplier of hash rate, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing\nmarket, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, according to\nFrost & Sullivan.\nWe mine cryptocurrencies for our own account and serve the cryptocurrency mining community by\nproviding innovative, reliable and easy-to-use cryptocurrency mining solutions. Headquartered in\nSingapore, we currently operate five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway with an\naggregate electricity capacity of 522MW as of June 30, 2022, which had increased to 775MW by the end of\n2022 by expanding our footprints to six mining datacenters globally. From these mining datacenters, we\ngenerate managing hash rate which is categorized into proprietary and hosting hash rate. As of June 30,\n2022, our proprietary hash rate reached 4.2 EH/s and accounted for 1.8% of the total Bitcoin network hash\nrate, making us the second largest holder of proprietary hash rate across the globe, according to Frost &\nSullivan. Together with the 6.3 EH/s hosting hash rate generated from mining machines hosted in our mining\ndatacenters, we possessed a total of 10.5 EH/s of managing hash rate as of June 30, 2022, accounting for\napproximately 4.6% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate.\nTo date, we primarily operate three business lines - \u201cproprietary mining,\u201d \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and\n\u201chosting.\u201d Proprietary mining refers to cryptocurrency mining for our own account, which allows us to\ndirectly capture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency. We offer two types of hash rate sharing\nsolutions, Cloud Hash Rate and Hash Rate Marketplace. Through Cloud Hash Rate, we sell our proprietary\nhash rate to customers. We offer hash rate subscription plans at fixed price and share mining income with\nthem under certain arrangements. As of June 30, 2022, our Cloud Hash Rate business achieved a market\nshare of 37.4% as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing market, according to Frost &\nSullivan. Through Hash Rate Marketplace, we connect reliable third-party hash rate suppliers with hash rate\nusers to facilitate hash rate sales and generate revenue from charging service fees. Our hosting services\noffer customers one-stop mining machine hosting solutions encompassing deployment, maintenance and\nmanagement services for efficient cryptocurrency mining. Among a wide selection of hosting services,\ncustomers can either subscribe to our Cloud Hosting service for the specified mining machines from which\nthey derive computing power under a \u201cgroup-buying\u201d model, or send their mining machines to our mining\ndatacenters for hosting under the General Hosting option or the Membership Hosting option. Historically,\nour hosting hash rate were generated from Cloud Hosting and General Hosting. All of our three business\nlines are supported by Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent software platform, which offers\nsoftware support to significantly reduce time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade and\nsubstantially decrease operation and maintenance headcount.\nWe source mining machines from a wide variety of manufacturers and traders with whom we have built\nrobust relationships over the years. As a result, the majority of our mining machines are spot machines for\nthe most recent and most commonly used models procured at a favorable price, which ensures high energy\nefficiency and stable hash rate supply both in quality and in quantum. We also engage in the sales of mining\nmachines from time to time. We stay at the forefront of technology development. As a market player who is\nable to obtain a hash rate unit of 1TH/s through our hash rate slicing technology, we have been successfully\nmaintaining a less than 5% fluctuation for 98% of our hash rate sales contracts.\nWe have achieved significant operational and financial results in recent periods. As of June 30, 2022, we\ngenerated 4.2EH/s proprietary hash rate from our proprietary mining machines and operated mining\ndatacenters with an aggregate electricity capacity of 522MW. Our revenue increased by 110.0% from US$88.8\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$186.4 million for the year ended December 31,\n196 TABLE OF CONTENTS\n2020, and further increased by 111.7% to US$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the first\nsix months in 2022, we generated US$179.6 million in total net revenue, as compared to US$219.7 million\ngenerated for the first six months in 2021. We incurred net loss of US$27.9 million and US$55.8 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, generated net profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and incurred net loss\nof US$25.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 195.2% from\nUS$16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$48.7 million for the year ended December 31,\n2020, and further increased by 479.2% to US$281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, our adjusted EBITDA was US$68.2 million, as compared to US$183.2 million for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2021. However, our recent growth trends may not continue and we may not be\nable to maintain or increase our profitability over the long term.\nThe crypto asset market, especially the price of Bitcoin, has been highly volatile. Recent industry-wide\ndevelopments, including the continued industry-wide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of\ncryptocurrency exchange FTX (including its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge\nfund Three Arrows, crypto miners Compute North and Core Scientific and crypto lenders Celsius Network,\nVoyager Digital and BlockFi, are beyond our control. We are not directly affected by these recent incidents,\nas we do not have any counterparty credit exposure to the above-mentioned firms nor expect their potential\nbankruptcy to have any direct impact on our business or operations.\nThat being said, the decrease and volatility of Bitcoin price as a result of the recent industry-wide\ndevelopments has affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, our\nproprietary mining business has become less profitable due to the drop in Bitcoin price. For the hash rate\nsharing and hosting businesses, the demand for such products has become lower due to the relatively\nbearish market on Bitcoin and the crypto asset market in general. However, we believe that, as compared to\nmany other participants in the crypto assets markets, we are more resilient to cryptocurrency price volatility\nas our \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and \u201chosting\u201d businesses allow us to smooth the impact of cryptocurrency price\nvolatility, as compared to \u201cproprietary mining.\u201d\nOur Strengths\nWe believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our\ncompetitors.\nWorld\u2019s leading scale of proprietary hash rate\nWe are the second largest holder of proprietary hash rate for Bitcoin across the globe, according to\nFrost & Sullivan. As of June 30, 2022, our proprietary hash rate operated in our global mining datacenters\nreached 4.2 EH/s and accounted for 1.8% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate. Our proprietary hash rate\nprovides us with a clear edge across our business lines and anchors our unique business model. High\nproprietary hash rate increases our chance of success in obtaining cryptocurrency rewards. It also allows a\nstable supply of hash rate products to our customers through Cloud Hash Rate. As a result, we achieved a\nmarket share of 37.4% in the cloud hash rate sharing market as measured by hash rate for sale as of June 30,\n2022, according to Frost & Sullivan. Leveraging our track record of operating the Cloud Hash Rate business,\nwe boosted user confidence in our brand and was able to launch Hash Rate Marketplace as our hash rate\nretail platform in the first half of 2021. In addition to proprietary hash rate, we also generate hosting hash\nrate, the other category of our total managing hash rate, from mining machines that are hosted in our mining\ndatacenters. Together with the 6.3 EH/s hosting hash rate, we managed a total of 10.5 EH/s hash rate as of\nJune 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, we operated five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and\nNorway to support our proprietary and hosting hash rate.\nUnique business model powers organic hash rate expansion by generating instant and continuous cash\nWe have established a business model that allows us to constantly reinforce our market-leading\nposition and outpace our competitors in terms of scaling up our proprietary hash rate. A prevailing strategy\nto profit from proprietary hash rate is mining. The cryptocurrencies mined can be sold at a profit when their\nmarket value is high enough to cover the cost of mining machines, electricity fees and other mining-related\nexpenses. While we remain engaged in proprietary mining business to capture the high appreciation\npotential of\n197 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncryptocurrency, we strategically allocate a significant amount of proprietary hash rate to hash rate sales\nthrough Cloud Hash Rate, to enable instant cash pay-back upon customers\u2019 subscription to our hash rate\nplans. We have successfully boosted sales for hash rate, in particular, for long-term hash rate subscription\nplans (i.e., plans with a term longer than 720 days) by providing an increasing amount of reliable and\ntransparent hash rate supply. We generally generate proceeds from hash rate sales under long-term hash rate\nsubscription plans that approximate the purchase cost of mining machines. Therefore, we are able to\ncontinuously grow our proprietary hash rate by funding the purchase of additional mining fleets with the\ninstant cash collected from hash rate sales using our existing mining fleets, significantly reducing our pay-\nback period to one month, compared to the long pay-back period associated with cryptocurrency mining\nactivities, which is typically from 6 to 18 months, according to Frost & Sullivan. This unique model also\nallows us to smooth the impact of cryptocurrency price volatility as our proceeds from hash rate sales are\nless directly related to cryptocurrency price compared to proprietary mining.\nAmple power supply and low electricity cost secured by global mining datacenters\nWe strategically opened five mining datacenters in the United States and Norway, where low electricity\ncost and crypto-friendly policies support stable operations. As of June 30, 2022, our mining datacenters had\na power supply of 522MW. We plan to expand our footprints to six mining datacenters across the globe to\nincrease our total electricity capacity to approximately 1,374MW, including 452MW power supply under\nconstruction and 400MW power supply \u201cin the pipeline,\u201d contracted but not yet under active construction.\nOur premier mining datacenters allowed us to successfully lower the average electricity cost of our mining\ndatacenters to US$40/MWh for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was significantly below the\nestimated global average of US$49/MWh during the same period, according to Frost & Sullivan. Our ability\nto secure ample power supply with low electricity cost is underpinned by our top-notch experience and\ncapabilities in global mining datacenters deployment and operation. We pioneer in deploying and operating\nmining datacenters globally. With experience in site selection, facility design, construction and maintenance\nin over 30 locations around the globe, our dedicated global team for mining datacenter construction\nunderstands the critical needs of Bitcoin mining as well as the complex and constantly evolving global\nlandscape of electricity supply. They also have extensive connections with local electricity experts and\npower enterprises around the world. We are the first in the industry to develop the \u201cPERT\u201d approach to\nsecure prime locations for our mining datacenters, which stands for a comprehensive site selection approach\nencompassing local electricity and cryptocurrency mining Policy, Electricity cost, Resources and\nconnections, and Technical feasibility. We believe we can continue to apply this systematic approach, our\ninsights and rich execution experience to global mining datacenter construction in the future, and hence\nachieve advantages in electricity capacity and electricity costs among our competitors.\nVisionary management team with a proven track record of innovation and execution\nOur success is driven by a passionate, visionary, tech-savvy and entrepreneurial management team with\na proven execution track record. This management team is led by our founder, Mr. Jihan Wu, a pioneer and\nleading figure in the cryptocurrency industry. Mr. Wu is viewed as an early advocate of cryptocurrency who\nintroduced the Bitcoin Whitepaper into the Sinophone world. Our management team has extensive\nexperience in the cryptocurrency industry, encompassing research and development, mining and sales of\nmining machines, and many of them are pioneers in mining datacenters construction and operation.\nOur Growth Strategies\nWe intend to focus on the following key strategies to grow our business.\nBuild a hash rate retail platform to facilitate the growth of the mining community\nWe believe that we have been and will continue to be a major contributor to the crypto-economy, with\nour vision to build a one-stop hash rate retail platform for the mining community. Since our inception, by\ndelivering high quality and reliable hash rate, we boost consumer confidence and stimulate demand for hash\nrate without heavily relying on marketing campaigns. We have seen growth in hash rate sales as a result of\nour efforts.\n198 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs we increase our scale of operations and generate more hash rate over time, we have rolled out\nmultiple product offerings, based on which we aim to create a hash rate retail platform that is uniquely\npositioned to serve both hash rate users and suppliers. Not only are we the largest supplier of hash rate\nourselves as of June 30, 2022, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing market,\naccording to Frost & Sullivan, we proactively partner with third-party hash rate suppliers, some of which are\ncustomers of our hosting services. Abundant supply of hash rate attracts and retains hash rate users to our\nHash Rate Marketplace. By building this retail platform, we aim to establish a cryptocurrency mining\ncommunity that is centered around and reinforced by our operations, where hash rate users and suppliers\nget to continually empower each other. We aim to deliver diverse, quality and transparent hash rate products\nthat lower the entry barrier of cryptocurrency mining as well as hash rate supply. We believe that the mining\ncommunity surrounding us will grow and prosper as a result, and that we will significantly benefit from being\nat the core of this mining community.\nContinue to scale up our mining datacenters\nWe believe mining datacenter capacity is critical to growing our proprietary hash rate and building the\ninfrastructure needed to support our booming hosting business. We currently operate five mining\ndatacenters in the United States and Norway, and plan to continue to scale up our mining datacenters across\nthe globe, by expanding existing mining datacenters and constructing new ones. To this end, we are actively\nstrategizing our mining datacenter expansion and are paying special attention to North American, North\nEurope, Central Asia and Southeast Asia, where we have the most connections and experience with. We are\nalso exploring innovative partnership models, including joint venture, to better work with our local partners\nand scale up our mining datacenters in a more efficient manner.\nContinue to enrich our product and services portfolio by supporting diversified crypto protocols\nWhile our services primarily support PoW protocol currently, we intend to enrich our product and\nservice portfolio by providing mining services covering new crypto protocols, including PoS, DPoS, PoST\nand PoC, and steadily increase the weight of new business to diversify revenue streams and attract new\ncustomers who are users of these new crypto protocols.\nImprove our product and service quality through more powerful Minerplus support\nWhile we have accumulated a large user base for Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent\nsoftware platform that significantly reduces time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade\nand substantially decreases operation and maintenance headcount, we intend to continuously upgrade\nMinerplus to provide more miners with professional and value-added support regarding real-time mining\ndatacenter and mining machine monitoring, hash rate protection and virus detection and removal, etc., to\nboost mining efficiency. Minerplus\u2019s hash rate monitoring function also enables us to keep track of the\nquality of third-party hash rate products on Hash Rate Marketplace and we can therefore ensure hash rate\nsuppliers admitted to Hash Rate Marketplace are able to provide hash rate products that meet our quality\nstandard. With access to a larger amount of data generated from mining activities through Minerplus, we\nexpect to gain a better understanding of the quality of power supply in different mining sites as well as the\ndemands and pain points of miners. We intend to create data-driven synergies including discovering prime\nmining site locations, determining the metrics of diverse hash rate products that cater to hash rate users\u2019\nneeds as well as offering more advanced mining machine deployment and operation solutions.\nOur Business Lines and Software Infrastructure\nTo date, we primarily operate three business lines\u202f-\u202f\u201cproprietary mining,\u201d \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and\n\u201chosting,\u201d all of which are supported by Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent software\nplatform, to enhance operational efficiency.\nProprietary mining\nWe mine cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoins, for our own account. Proprietary mining allows us to\ncapture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency to support our future expansion and operation. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022,\n199 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespectively, we generated US$37.5 million, US$88.5 million, US$191.7 million, US$111.3 million and US$41.0\nmillion in revenue from proprietary mining. Historically, approximately 50% of our proprietary hash rate was\nutilized to support our proprietary mining, with the rest available for sale to customers through Cloud Hash\nRate. However, we retain the flexibility to allocate our proprietary hash rate to either proprietary mining or\nCloud Hash Rate, primarily based on our view of the Bitcoin market trends.\nHash rate sharing\nWe offer two types of hash rate sharing solutions, Cloud Hash Rate and Hash Rate Marketplace, to\nsupport cryptocurrency mining activities globally with convenient, transparent and reliable hash rate.\nCloud Hash Rate. Through Cloud Hash Rate, customers enter into hash rate contracts with us to\nsubscribe to the hash rate derived from our proprietary mining machines, saving themselves from\npurchasing, installing or hosting mining machines. Cloud Hash Rate features authentic and\ntransparent hash rate products as users can track the hash rate output on their chosen third-party\nmining pool, easily ascertain that they receive the right value and receive payments directly from\nmining pools. With our hash rate slicing and hash rate scheduling technologies, we are able to\nmaintain a less than 5% fluctuation for 98% of our hash rate contracts and provide our customers\n100% continuous online computing power for series of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Filecoin,\nLitecoin, Nervos CKB, Zcash, etc., subject to stable electricity supply. We offer our customers\nvarious hash rate subscription plans, primarily under (i) \u201cclassic mode\u201d and (ii) \u201caccelerator mode\u201d,\nwhich enables customers to shorten investment costs recovery cycle. After a user subscribes to a\ncloud hash rate plan, mining pool operators connect the cloud hash rate generated from our mining\nmachines to blockchain network for a period specified in the cloud hash rate plan subscribed to and\ncryptocurrency rewards are delivered directly to the crypto wallet of the Cloud Hash Rate customer.\nFor plans under \u201cclassic mode\u201d, we generate revenue from fees paid to subscribe the hash rate as well\nas electricity, which maintains the mining machines that produce the subscribed hash rate. For hash\nrate subscription plans under \u201caccelerator mode\u201d, while customers enjoy lower hash rate subscription\nfees compared to \u201cclassic mode\u201d, on top of the aforementioned hash rate and electricity subscription\nfees, we are also entitled to sharing part of the mining rewards net of the electricity cost the customer\npaid for once that customer\u2019s investment cost is recovered, which is defined as the cumulative mining\nreward received from the mining pool equals the amount of hash rate subscription fees paid upfront\nand the electricity fee paid and used to date. This unique model of selling cloud hash rate allows us\nto smooth the impact of Bitcoin price volatility as our income from hash rate sales are less directly\nrelated to cryptocurrency price compared to proprietary mining. When Bitcoin price appreciates, we\ncan capture part of the benefits as the demand of hash rate will be driven up\u037e when Bitcoin price\ndepreciates, we are still able to recover costs or generate revenue from hash rate sales. We use\nstandard agreement with our customer for Cloud Hash Rate. For the years ended December 31, 2019,\n2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, we generated US$43.5\nmillion, US$78.3 million, US$124.2 million US$62.0 million and US$74.9 million in revenue from Cloud\nHash Rate.\nHash Rate Marketplace. We connect supply of hash rate from mining machines owned by third parties,\nsuch as miners or mining datacenter owners, with our user base with hash rate demands, allowing\nsuch hash rate suppliers to access our large base of high-quality customers. With the newly rolled-\nout Hash Rate Marketplace, we offer a marketplace that is able to utilize excessive hash rate in the\nnetwork and expand ways of monetization for third-party hash rate suppliers, accelerating their cash\npay-back to support future expansion. For transactions completed on Hash Rate Marketplace, the\nthird-party hash rate suppliers will be responsible for providing hash rate and post-sale services,\npursuant to the negotiated terms between these third-party hash rate suppliers and customers, with\nwhich we have no involvement and we generate revenue by charging service fees. Revenue\ngenerated from Hash Rate Marketplace was immaterial prior to June 30, 2022.\nHosting\nWe offer three types of hosting services, Cloud Hosting, General Hosting and Membership Hosting, to\nmeet customers\u2019 diverse demands for professional hosting solutions and lower the prohibitive upfront\ninvestment costs associated with mining datacenter construction, deployment and operation.\n200 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCloud Hosting. We provide retail miner customers with one-stop mining machine hosting solutions,\nenabling them to gain access to stable supply of computing power from specified mining machines in\na capital-light manner. Through Cloud Hosting, users participate in a customer group, pay an upfront\nfee for the computing power produced by the specified mining machines, and subscribe to the\nhosting service for the same mining machines. As such, customers may enjoy the computing power\nderived from specified mining machines over the life of such mining machines to generate\ncryptocurrency rewards. Traditionally, a miner has to purchase and physically possess a mining\nmachine, deploy and operate it in a mining datacenter in order to gain access to all the computing\npower generated from that specified mining machine. Cloud Hosting provides an innovative\nalternative by providing hosting service for the specified mining machines that produce computing\npower for the Cloud Hosting customers, saving the customers the need to pick up the mining\nmachine, construct one\u2019s own mining datacenter, and operate and deploy the mining machine.\nSpecifically, we are responsible for the operation and maintenance of mining datacenter that hosts the\nmining machines, as well as mining machine operation, maintenance and repair. As such, we\nsignificantly lower the upfront investment and expertise threshold for retail miners, providing them\nwith the same opportunity of cryptocurrency returns as major and sophisticated miners. We also\nprovide complete set of cloud hosting technical solutions and resources to ensure operational\nefficiency. Our first-of-its-kind \u201cgroup-buying\u201d model allows retail miners to purchase the computing\nservice from and maintenance service for as little as one mining machine, further lessening the\nupfront investment burden. Similar to the Cloud Hash Rate \u201caccelerator mode\u201d subscription plans, in\n2021, we launched the \u201caccelerated payback mode\u201d for Cloud Hosting, where customers can enjoy a\nfavorable rate for the upfront fee compared to \u201cclassic mode\u201d  (i.e., the traditional arrangement). Under\nthe standard agreements with our customers for Cloud Hosting, we charge customers an upfront fee\nso they can secure the procurement of computing power from the specified mining machines. We also\ncharge a maintenance fee for our electricity supply, daily maintenance and repair care. We are entitled\nto a portion of the mining profit of an \u201caccelerated payback mode\u201d customer after the customer\nrecovers the investment cost, which is defined as the mining reward earned from the mining pool\nequals the upfront fee paid and the maintenance fee and other fees incurred to date. For the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, the\nrevenue generated from Cloud Hosting was nil, US$2.9 million, US$7.6 million, US$6.0 million and\nUS$6.8 million, respectively. We did not generate any revenue from mining profit sharing from plans\nunder Cloud Hosting\u2019s \u201caccelerated payback mode\u201d for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022.\nGeneral Hosting. We offer hosting solutions to professional miner customers who send their mining\nmachines to our mining datacenters for hosting. Specifically, we provide server room, professional\nsupport from technical and managerial personnel, supporting power, network and security monitoring\nfacilities, among others, and carry out routine maintenance, system configurations, troubleshooting\nand daily reporting to ensure a smooth operation of the hosted mining machines. At the customers\u2019\noption, we also provide assistance for deployment, installation and removal of hosted mining\nmachines and repairment of mining machines. Under the standard agreements with General Hosting\ncustomers, we charge monthly service fees, which include costs of operating and maintaining the\nmining machines, costs of electricity and other costs mainly related to mining machine deployment\nand repair. We generated no revenue prior to December 31, 2020 and revenue of US$18.3 million,\nUS$0.9 million and US$53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, from General Hosting.\nMembership Hosting. We offer a membership program for large-scale miner customers who seek stable,\nlong-term supply of hosting capacity and send their mining machines to our mining datacenters for\nhosting purpose. In addition to the hosting services we provide to customers under General Hosting\nmentioned above, customers of this membership program enjoy program benefits, including, among\nother things, (i) early, priority and exclusive access to the newly available hosting capacity that is\nsufficient for large-scale miners, upon a new mining datacenter becomes available and (ii) favorable\npricing terms for our hosting services such as mining datacenter and mining machine operations and\nmaintenance as well as mining machine deployment. We charge membership fees, and service fees,\nwhich include costs of operating and maintaining the mining machines, costs of electricity and other\ncosts mainly related to mining machine deployment and repair. For our Membership Hosting\ncontracts,\n201 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npayment terms are individually negotiated and may differ among customers. Through this membership\nprogram, we seek to facilitate risk control and stable hosting income from large-scale miner customers\nby providing them reliable and long-term hosting capacity. We also intend to leverage our\nMembership Hosting to facilitate the growth of Hash Rate Marketplace as we encourage some of the\nMembership Hosting customers to become hash rate suppliers on our Hash Rate Marketplace. We\ngenerated no revenue from Membership Hosting prior to June 30, 2022.\nThe major differences between Cloud Hosting and General Hosting are the source of mining machines,\nthe intended customer base and the business model that we generate revenue from. Cloud Hosting leverages\nmining machines from existing mining fleets owned by us and serves retail miner customers under a \u201cgroup-\nbuying\u201d model, with an upfront fee charged at the commencement of the service and continuing maintenance\nfees charged throughout the whole service process. General Hosting, just like other industry players, hosts\nmining machines received from professional miner customers that look to expand their mining operation in\nexchange for monthly hosting fees. We expect to continue offering existing Cloud Hosting plans but no\nlonger as our mainstream product. In the near future, we expect to focus on further expanding our General\nHosting services by allocating a greater portion of our growing mining datacenter capacity to General\nHosting. We believe that focusing on General Hosting will enable us to maximize assets utilization with\nminimal capital expenditure for our growing mining datacenter capacity, maximize overall scale of hash rate\nsupported by our software platform Minerplus which may lead to future business opportunities, and improve\nthe operational efficiency by serving professional customers.\nMinerplus\u202fis our self-developed integrated intelligent software platform that offers software support to\nsignificantly reduce time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade and substantially\ndecrease operation and maintenance headcount. The functions of Minerplus mainly encompasses real-time\nmining datacenter and hash rate monitoring as well as virus detection and removal. Minerplus enables\nintelligent management of our proprietary mining business and enhances product and service quality of\nCloud Hash Rate and our hosting services. We also provide standalone Minerplus service to third-party\nmining datacenters.\nMeasures to prevent unauthorized or impermissible customer access\nWe have established anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) processes, know your customer (\u201cKYC\u201d)\nprocedures and IP address geo-blocking measures, to prevent unauthorized and impermissible access to our\nhash rate products by U.S. customers and customers from other jurisdictions where we have identified laws\nor regulations that restrict the offering of our hash rate products. These measures generally encompass the\nfollowing key steps: 1) following IP address and customer identification, IP addresses located in regions\nsuch as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Crimea Area, will be blocked, and IP addresses in most other\nareas, including the United States, will be asked to complete AML and KYC procedures prior to purchasing\nour products and services\u037e 2) following and based on the results of customer due diligence process,\ncustomers from the United States or other applicable jurisdictions will be denied purchase of our hash rate\nproducts\u037e 3) transactions and the KYC status of the customers will be subject to our monitoring and periodic\nreview.\nFor a discussion of the risks relating to offering our hash rate products to U.S. customers and/or\ncustomers from other jurisdictions where such offering may be restricted, see the section entitled \u201cRisk\nFactors\u202f-\u202fRisks Related to Bitdeer\u202f-\u202fRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Other Legal Matters\u202f-\u202f\nBitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing business may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction if Bitdeer is not able to avoid\noffering or selling its hash rate products to U.S. customers. Additionally, Bitdeer\u2019s hash rate sharing\nbusiness may be deemed as securities offerings in other jurisdictions where it is offered.\u201d\nOur Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies and Protocols Involved in Our Business\n89.1%, 96.5%, 96.9% and 95.9% of our proprietary mining revenue for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 respectively were generated from Bitcoin mining.\nThe remaining mining yield were generated from Zcash, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin and other\ncryptocurrencies that are less mainstream, as illustrated below:\n202 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nYear ended \nDecember 31,\n2019\nYear ended \nDecember 31, 2020\nYear ended \nDecember 31, 2021\nSix months ended \nJune 30, 2022\nUSD\u2019000\n%\nUSD\u2019000\n%\nUSD\u2019000\n%\nUSD\u2019000\n%\nBTC\n33,371\n89.1\n85,355\n96.5\n185,656\n96.9\n39,297\n95.9\nZEC\n1,379\n3.7\n1,419\n1.6\n3,220\n1.7\n751\n1.8\nETH\n981\n2.6\n781\n0.9\n14\n0.0\n3\n0.0\nLTC\n642\n1.7\n252\n0.3\n597\n0.3\n118\n0.3\nBCH\n480\n1.3\n204\n0.2\n180\n0.1\n18\n0.0\nDCR\n357\n1.0\n153\n0.2\n54\n0.0\n90\n0.2\nDASH\n175\n0.5\n14\n0.0\n-\n-\n-\n-\nETC\n86\n0.1\n138\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCKB\n-\n-\n177\n0.2\n272\n0.1\n22\n0.1\nDOGE\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,239\n0.6\n294\n0.7\nXCH\n-\n-\n-\n-\n165\n0.1\n43\n0.1\nHNS\n-\n-\n-\n-\n137\n0.1\n34\n0.1\nFIL\n-\n-\n-\n-\n129\n0.1\n327\n0.8\nSC\n-\n-\n-\n-\n30\n0.0\n-\n-\nNMC\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n10\n0.0\nELA\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3\n0.0\nTotal\n37,471\n100.0\n88,493\n100.0\n191,693\n100.0\n41,010\n100.0\n78.8%, 84.5%, 93.4% and 95.8% of our Cloud Hash Rate revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019,\n2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 were generated from hash rate plans subscribed for\nBitcoin mining. In the second half of 2021, we commenced mining operation on a proprietary basis for\nFilecoin, which adopted PoST protocol, and also offered computing power sharing solutions regarding\nFilecoin mining under our Cloud Hash Rate business. While we intend to enrich our product and service\nportfolio by providing mining services covering new crypto protocols, including PoS, DPoS, PoST and PoC,\nwe have not determined the type of cryptocurrency to expand our operations.\nPolicies and Procedures Related to Our Cryptocurrencies\nWe obtain cryptocurrencies from proprietary mining and also generally accept cryptocurrencies as\npayment for services available to customers, such as Cloud Hash Rate, Cloud Hosting, General Hosting\nand Membership Hosting. We generally do not hold cryptocurrencies obtained through business operation,\nincluding mining and otherwise, and promptly convert them into fiat currency. The cryptocurrencies held by\nus as of December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and June 30, 2022 were US$1.1 million, US$9.6 million, US$6.2 million\nand US$3.1 million, respectively and accounted for 1.2%, 5.2%, 1.6% and 1.7% of our total revenue in the\ncorresponding periods.

Please see the section entitled \u201c-\nOur Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices\u201d below for more details on the related procedures in\nthis regard.\nPrior to June 30, 2021, we did not leverage cryptocurrencies that we held, including Bitcoin, to generate\nadditional income, through lending, hedging or otherwise, nor did we convert our fiat currencies into\ncryptocurrencies for the same purposes. In the second half of 2021, we explored new options, such as short-\nterm cryptocurrency lending and purchase of short-term wealth management products using\ncryptocurrencies converted from our fiat currencies, in addition to direct deposits of fiat currencies at fixed\nrates, in order to optimize our cash management cycle and generate a higher return on cash not otherwise\nused in our operating activities. Specifically, during the second half of 2021, we lent 30 million USDC, which\nwe converted from our fiat currencies, to Matrixport Group at a fixed annual interest rate of 8.25% and\nreceived approximately US$0.7 million interest income\u037e we also converted our fiat currencies into 30 million\nUSDT and purchased a short-term wealth management product in the same amount from Matrixport Group.\nThe wealth management product was an unsecured USDT fund offered by Matrixport Group at variable rates\nof return, and we received approximately US$0.7 million investment income from such product in the second\nhalf of 2021. Both the loan and the wealth management product were fully redeemed and collected by the end\nof 2021. In addition, because we generally do not hold cryptocurrencies, while the incomes we received were\ninitially in cryptocurrencies, they were promptly converted into fiat currencies following receipt. During the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022, we lent loans in a total amount of approximately US$50.0 million to\nMatrixport Group and received approximately US$0.4 million interest income. We also purchased wealth\nmanagement products in a total amount of approximately US$150.0 million from Matrixport Group and\nreceived approximately US$0.3 million in return. Both the loans and the wealth management products were\nfully collected and redeemed as of June 30, 2022. To date, we have not experienced, either directly or\nindirectly, prohibitions from redeeming or withdrawing crypto assets. All of our cryptocurrency loans and\ncryptocurrency wealth management products had been fully redeemed by December 2022, and we do not\nanticipate to actively participate in such activities in the foreseeable future.\n204 \n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not have any outstanding cryptocurrency\nlending to Matrixport Group or any outstanding wealth management product purchased from Matrixport\nGroup or otherwise. All lending or wealth management products previously purchased from Matrixport Group\nhad been fully collected or redeemed by the end of December 2022. In light of recent concerns over the lack\nof regulations with regards to digital asset based products in general, we do not anticipate entering into any\ndigital asset based lending or wealth management products with Matrixport Group or otherwise in the\nforeseeable future.\nWe are open to more options to generate additional income by leveraging our cryptocurrencies and fiat\ncurrencies in the future\u037e however, we prioritize our operating activities in terms of cash usage and will ensure\nthat our cash, short-term investment and anticipated proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrencies in\nconnection with our principal business will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated working capital\nrequirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 18 months from the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Therefore, we currently do not expect to actively expand our cryptocurrency lending\nand investing activities, and may engage in fewer such activities depending on various factors, including\naforementioned cash reserve and anticipated working capital requirements. We monitor our investments\nclosely and limit our exposure to the investment risk by including in our operation strategy the requirements\nto invest only in robust wealth management products and the investments need to be redeemed within the\nsame fiscal quarter.\nWe will evaluate each digital asset in our portfolio, or that we propose to hold or acquire in the future,\nto determine whether it would likely be considered a security as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities\nAct and consequences thereof, in consultation with outside counsel, as applicable at the time. We will base\nour analysis on relevant case law, applying the frameworks established by the U.S. Supreme Court and taking\ninto consideration relevant guidance by the SEC and its staff, including the SEC\u2019s \u201cFramework for\n\u2018Investment Contract\u2019 Analysis of Digital Assets\u201d issued by the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial\nTechnology. Prior to holding or acquiring any digital assets, we would undertake customary due diligence\nregarding the digital asset in order to gather facts necessary to make such a determination.\nHowever, such framework adopted by us to determine whether certain digital assets are \u201csecurities\u201d\ninvolves risk-based judgements by us, is not based on a legal standard or determination binding on any\nregulatory body, and therefore is inherently associated with a number of risks. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, with the exception of certain centrally issued digital assets that have received \u201cno-\naction\u201d letters from the SEC staff, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only digital assets which senior officials at\nthe SEC have publicly stated are unlikely to be considered securities. However, such statements are not\nofficial policy statements by the SEC and reflect only the speakers\u2019 views, which are not binding on the SEC\nor any other agency or court and cannot be generalized to any other digital asset. It is possible that a change\nin the governing administration or the appointment of new SEC commissioners could substantially impact\nthe views of the SEC and its staff.\nThus a particular digital asset\u2019s status as a \u201csecurity\u201d in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high\ndegree of uncertainty and if a regulator disagrees with our characterization of a digital asset, we may be\nsubject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition. Current and future legislation and SEC-rulemaking and\nother regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the\nmanner in which Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing\npurposes. In particular, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of\n\u201csecurity\u201d by SEC rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another\nexemption is available, including transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies among owners and\nrequiring registration of trading platforms as \u201cexchanges.\u201d It will then likely become difficult or impossible\nfor the digital asset to be traded, cleared or custodied in the United States through the same channels used\nby non-security digital assets, which in addition to materially and adversely affecting the trading value of\nthe digital asset is likely to cause substantial volatility and significantly impact its liquidity and market\nparticipants\u2019 ability to convert the digital asset into U.S. dollars.\nFor a more comprehensive discussion of the relevant risks, please see the sections entitled \u201cRisk\nFactors\u202f-\u202fRisks Related to Bitdeer\u202f-\u202fRisks Related to Cryptocurrencies\u202f-\u202fThere is no one unifying principle\ngoverning the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies nor whether cryptocurrencies are securities in any\nparticular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature of an\n205 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninvestment in Bitdeer or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies, such as cryptocurrencies, in a manner that\nadversely affects Bitdeer\u2019s business, prospects or operations\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Bitdeer -\nRisks Related to Cryptocurrencies - If Bitdeer were deemed an \u2018investment company\u2019 under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for Bitdeer to continue its\nbusiness as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on Bitdeer\u2019s business.\u201d\nOur Cryptocurrencies Storage and Custodial Practices\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022,\nsubstantially all of our cryptocurrencies were held in custody by Matrixport Group and our disposal of\ncryptocurrencies, at spot price on the date of disposal, was primarily to Matrixport Group, a related party.\nFollowing our separation from BitMain Technologies Holding Company, we entered into two custody\nagreements with Matrixport Group on February 10, 2021 through our subsidiaries, pursuant to which we\nappointed Matrixport Group to (i) establish a custody account for the deposit of cryptocurrencies to be held\nby Matrixport Group on our behalf, and (ii) act as the custodian of the cryptocurrencies that are delivered to\nthe designated blockchain address under our custody accounts. For more information, please see the section\nentitled \u201cRisk Factors\u202f-\u202fBitdeer may not have adequate sources of recovery if the cryptocurrencies held it us\nare lost, stolen or destroyed due to third-party cryptocurrencies custodial services or if Bitdeer cannot\nredeem or withdraw its cryptocurrencies invested in crypto lending or investing activities. Such incidents\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nOur custody accounts in Matrixport Group are protected by username, password, and hardware tokens.\nWe are able to view the assets in the custody account and relevant transfers via Matrixport Group\u2019s custody\nsystem. We are able to receive, withdraw and dispose of cryptocurrencies with the custody account. Each\nwithdrawal request is subject to verification by a person designated by us, and if withdrawal is up to certain\nlimit, to additional verification procedure applied by Matrixport Group, including calling a separately\ndesignated person or requesting additional written confirmation. We note that Matrixport Group offers a\nrobust security infrastructure designed to safeguard its custody clients from crypto fraud. The generation\nand storage of, and the transaction signing by, the private keys are all under encryption in hardware security\nmodules (HSMs) that provide tamper evidence, tamper resistance and tamper responsiveness features to\nsafeguard the private keys and make sure no staff of Matrixport Group or anyone can have access to plain\ntext of private keys. In extreme cases, private keys can be recovered by Matrixport Group\u2019s disaster recovery\nmeasure. Private keys have been sharding into eight pieces that will be stored in an encrypted hard disk\nwhich will then be kept in physical safe deposit boxes in different banks. These sharding pieces are\naccessible only to certain qualified employees of Matrixport Group, who must obtain prior permission and\nmust follow \u201cSegregation of Duty and Least Knowledge Principle\u201d under which such employees have right\nto recover the private keys but no right to trigger the withdrawal function from customers\u2019 designated\naccounts. All crypto transactions will be monitored by Matrixport Group\u2019s central security system. If an\nunusual transaction is identified, an alert will be issued to the relevant customer in real time for transaction\nverification purposes.\nAll withdrawal and transfer of assets shall be permitted by applicable laws and regulations and\nMatrixport Group\u2019s internal policies and procedures. Matrixport Group is obligated to keep and maintain, or\ncause to be kept, accurate books and records with respect to any custody account and assets in accordance\nwith applicable law. Statements of assets, along with a ledger of receipts and disbursements of assets is\navailable to us via Matrixport Group\u2019s custody system. Under the custody agreements, we are obligated to\npay to Matrixport custody fees as a percentage of the value of the cryptocurrencies in U.S. Dollars under\ncustody, monthly management fees as negotiated, and withdrawal fees if applicable. We incurred\napproximately US$0.3 million and US$0.08 million service fees, respectively, including primarily custody fees,\nto Matrixport Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022, while the\nservice fees we paid to Matrixport Group for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 were immaterial.\nOur Proprietary Mining Datacenters\nWe have built and currently operate three proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and two\nin Norway with an aggregate electricity capacity of 522MW in use as of June 30, 2022. We have initiated the\nexpansion of our existing mining datacenters and had achieved access to a total electricity capacity of\n775MW by the end of 2022 and 1,374MW thereafter. The locations of our mining datacenters in use, under\nconstruction and \u201cin the pipeline\u201d are illustrated in the diagram below.\n206 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNotes:\nAs of June 30, 2022. Out of 452MW of capacity under construction, 253MW had been completed within\n2022, with the rest to be completed afterwards.\nAs of June 30, 2022\nIn the pipeline includes 400MW power supply contracted but not yet under active construction\nTexas Mining Datacenters. Our mining datacenter in Rockdale, Texas became operational in February\n2019 and has 386MW electricity capacity in use as of June 30, 2022. We had increased the electricity\ncapacity of this mining datacenter to 562MW from the expansion of our facilities by the end of 2022.\nNorway Mining Datacenters.

We had added 26MW and 50MW of\nelectricity capacity to each of the two mining datacenters by the end of 2022 from the upgrade of the\ntwo facilities. Additionally, we plan to add additional 400MW of electricity capacity from the\nexpansion of facilities of the mining datacenter in Tydal, Norway.\nTennessee Mining Datacenter. Our mining datacenter in Knoxville, Tennessee became operational in\nMay 2020 and we had 86MW electricity capacity in use as of June 30, 2022.\nWashington Mining Datacenter. Our mining datacenter in Pangborn, Washington became operational in\nMay 2018 and we had 13MW electricity capacity in use as of June 30, 2022.\nWe have accumulated knowledge and expertise in the global landscape of electric power supply, which\nenables us to select prime locations to construct mining datacenters. We are currently exploring other sites\nfor constructions of our mining datacenters with an initial focus on North American, North Europe, Central\nAsia and Southeast Asia.\nAgreements Related to Our Proprietary Mining Datacenters\nLease Agreement for the Mining Datacenter in Rockdale, Texas\nOn June 6, 2018, Dory Creek, LLC, our subsidiary (formerly as Bitmain Inc.\u2019s subsidiary), entered into a\nLease Agreement with Alcoa USA Corp. (\u201cAlcoa\u201d), by the First Amendment of Lease dated October 18, 2018,\nby the Second Amendment of Lease dated May 1, 2019, by the Third Amendment of Lease dated May 11,\n2021, by the Fourth Amendment to the Lease dated May 11, 2021, by the Fifth Amendment to Lease dated\nSeptember 15, 2021 and the Sixth Amendment to Lease dated October 25, 2021, pursuant to which we\n207 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nlease land, certain buildings and improvements on the land, a certain portion of Alcoa\u2019s power delivery\nnetwork (\u201cPUN\u201d) and the non-exclusive right to use certain common areas in Rockdale Texas, for the\noperation of a blockchain data processing software and hardware center (\u201cData Center\u201d) as well as the office\nuse and a technology repair facility related to the Data Center. Alcoa sells and conveys to us a 100%\nownership interest in a certain PUN power circuit and the associated downstream components, subject to\ncertain power delivery restrictions. Upon termination of the Lease Agreement, our interest and ownership in\nthe PUN will revert to Alcoa. For the period from June 6, 2018 through December 31, 2018, we paid Alcoa a\nlump sum rent of US$250,000. In 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2020, we paid US$2,400,000 and\nUS$2,125,000 rent to Alcoa under the Lease Agreement. We have an option to extend the term of this lease\nfor two successive periods of five years (each such period an \u201cExtension Term\u201d). If applicable, on each\nJanuary 1 during the Extension Term, the annual fixed rent shall increase by the greater of 2.5% or the\npercentage of the change in the CPI, not to exceed 5% in any single year between the first month and the\neleventh month during the previous year.\nLand Lease Agreement for the Molde Mining Datacenter in Fr\u00e6na Municipality, Norway\nOn November 15, 2019, we entered into a land lease agreement with Troll Housing AS through Norway\nHash Technologies AS, our subsidiary, as amended by three addenda (i.e., Addendum 1, Addendum 2 and\nAddendum 3) we entered into on December 6, 2020, March 22, 2021 and March 22, 2021, respectively,\npursuant to which we lease land located at Klempert\u00e5svegen 1, 6440 Elnesv\u00e5gen, Norway to support our\nMolde mining datacenter with 67MW capacity. For the existing 30MW specified in Addendum 1, land rent is\ncalculated based on the installed capacity of datacenter, with a unit price of NOK0.01 per kW prior to\nJanuary 1, 2021 and NOK0.02 per kW starting from January 1, 2021. For the subsequent expansion of 37MW\nspecified in Addendum 2 and the future potential expansions referred to in Addendum 3, the land rent is\ninvoiced monthly and comprises two components, Monthly Rent 1 and Monthly Rent 2. Monthly Rent 1 is\ncalculated based on datacenter capacity, with a fixed unit price of NOK0.0060 per kWh. Monthly Rent 2 is\ncalculated using floating unit price, being adjusted downwards as total energy use, from the total capacity of\nMolde and Tydal mining datacenters excluding the existing 30MW specified in Addendum 1, goes up. The\nfloating unit price for Monthly Rent 2 is NOK0.014 per kWh, NOK0.012 per kWh, NOK0.008 per kWh and\nNOK0.004 per kWh when energy used from datacenter capacity is high than 30MW and lower than 107MW,\nhigher than or equal to 107MW and lower than 247MW, higher than or equal to 247MW and lower than\n427MW, and higher than and equal to 427MW, respectively. The land lease for the corresponding expansion\nwill be invoiced upon the relevant mining datacenter expansions are finished and delivered to us, the\nexpansion pass the inspection before power-on and the power grid company completes the corresponding\n132-22kV transformer upgrade. The term of the lease agreement is from December 1, 2019 to December 31,\n2029, renewable within the term.\nLand Lease Agreement for the Tydal Mining Datacenter in Tydal Municipality, Norway\nOn April 8, 2021, we entered into a land lease agreement with Tydal Datacenter AS through Norway\nOn April 8, 2021, we entered into a land lease agreement with Tydal Datacenter AS through Norway\nHash Technologies AS, our subsidiary, pursuant to which we lease land located at Kirkvollen\nIndustriomr\u00e5de, 7590 Tydal, Norway to support our Tydal mining datacenter. The land lease will be invoiced\nupon the relevant mining datacenter expansions are finished and delivered to us, the expansion pass the\ninspection before power-on and the power grid company completes the corresponding 132-22kV transformer\nupgrade. The land rent comprises two components, Monthly Rent 1 and Monthly Rent 2. Monthly Rent 1 is\ncalculated based on datacenter capacity, with a fixed unit price of NOK0.0060 per kWh. Monthly Rent 2 is\ncalculated according to Addendum 3 of Land Lease Agreement for the Molde Mining Datacenter in Norway\ndated March 22, 2021 (See Land Lease Agreement for the Molde Mining Datacenter in Norway). The term of\nthe lease agreement is from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2031, renewable within the term.\nCommercial Purchase and Sale Agreement for the Mining Datacenter in Knoxville, Tennessee\nOn February 26, 2018, Bitmain Inc. entered into a commercial purchase and sale agreement with Kemet\nFoil Manufacturing LLC, FKA Cornell Dublilier pursuant to which it purchased from Kemet Foil\nManufacturing LLC, FKA Cornell Dublilier a tract of land of approximately 9.88 acres improved with a 77,678\nsquare foot industrial building together with all fixtures, landscaping, improvements, and appurtenances,\nlocated at 5101 S. National Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914, for a consideration of\n208 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nUS$3,600,000. On March 20, 2018, Bitmain Inc. transferred a quitclaim deed of the aforementioned track of\nland to Carpenter Creek LLC, our subsidiary, in consideration of the sum of one dollar and other good and\nvaluable considerations.\nVacant Land Purchase and Sale Agreement for the Mining Datacenter in Pangborn, Washington\nOn August 3, 2017, we entered into a vacant land purchase and sale agreement with Blackhawk\nDevelopment Inc through Antcreek, LLC, our subsidiary, pursuant to which we purchased from Blackhawk\nDevelopment Inc a tract of land of 3 acres located at BLA of Parent Parcel 93700000002, East Wenatchee, WA\n98802 for a consideration of US$400,000. We use the land to support the operation of our mining datacenter\nin Pangborn, Washington.\nEnergy\nWe have built, and will continue to make significant investment in building strong partnerships with\nlocal electricity experts and power enterprises. Through these partnerships, we successfully lowered the\naverage electricity cost of our proprietary mining datacenters to US$40/MWh for the year ended December\n31, 2021, which was significantly below the estimated global average of US$49/MWh during the same period,\naccording to Frost & Sullivan. We entered into electric power supply agreements with electricity suppliers to\nsecure low electricity costs for our mining datacenters in Rockdale, Texas, and in Norway.\nWe consider environmental protection vitally important and have implemented measures in the\noperation of our business, in particular mining datacenters, to ensure our compliance with all applicable laws\nand regulations in the United States, Norway and other applicable jurisdictions. Our hash rate expansion\nstrategy is energy conscious. We constantly monitor the operation of our mining machines and replace old\nmining machines models with new ones periodically to optimize energy efficiency. As a result, we\nsuccessfully lowered our average energy consumption from 47.3j/T as of December 31, 2020 to 39.2j/T as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and further to 36j/T as of June 30, 2022. Through years of experience in and deep insight\ninto the global power supply market, we are able to discover outstanding mining construction resources that\nare both cost-efficient and environmentally friendly.\nWe stick with high environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and constantly increase the\nratio of power supply generated from carbon-free energy. The ratio of our carbon-free power supply reached\napproximately 53% as of June 30, 2022, and is expected to increase to approximately 64% upon completing\nthe construction of all mining datacenters \u201cin the pipeline\u201d. The ratio of our carbon-free power supply, as\nused herein, represents the weighted average ratio of carbon-free power supply at our datacenters,\nweighting in the respective electricity capacity at each datacenter. To be more specific, it is calculated by\ndividing (x) the sum of ratio of carbon-free power supply multiple by electricity capacity at each of our\ndatacenters, by (y) the total electricity capacity contributed by all our datacenters.\nAccording to the latest available statistics regarding energy structure of power supply from respective\nlocal authorities or suppliers as of June 30, 2022, (i) the power supply in our mining datacenter in Pangborn,\nWashington was 100% carbon-free, almost entirely supported by hydroelectric resources, (ii) the power\nsupply in our mining datacenters in Molde and Tydal, Norway was 100% carbon-free, primarily supported by\nwind and hydroelectric resources, (iii) the power supply in our mining datacenter in Rockdale, Texas was\napproximately 46% carbon-free, supported by clean energy resources such as wind, nuclear, solar and\nhydroelectric, as well as traditional energy resources such as gas and coal, and (iv) the power supply in our\nmining datacenter in Knoxville, Tennessee was approximately 60% carbon-free, supported by clean energy\nresources, such as unclear, hydroelectric and solar, as well as traditional energy resources such as clean-\nburning natural gas units. To further improve the ratio of our carbon-free power supply, we intend to engage\na carbon offset strategy consultant to formulate a carbon emissions offsetting plan for our mining\ndatacenters in Texas.\nSales and Marketing\nHistorically, we attracted and retained our customers by offering high-quality products and services,\nwithout heavily relying on online or offline advertising campaigns to promote the sales of our products and\n209 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nservices. The quality of our products and services is demonstrated by the 100% continuous hash rate online\nrate and minimum customer complaints.\nTechnologies\nWe stay at the forefront of technology development and have built prominent research and\ndevelopment capabilities. We benefit from our continuous investment in research and development as well as\nour strong and expanding research and development talent pool. Our core technical team has an average of\nover eight years of experience in major market players in the cryptocurrency industry. We have obtained\npatents to support key technologies underpinning our operations.\nOur technology capabilities drive the differentiation of our business. In particular, the following\ntechnologies enable us to constantly improve our proprietary mining efficiency, offer differentiated and\nquality products and services, and minimize impacts to the environment.\nHash rate slicing. We supply our customers the subscribed amount of hash rate by first dividing hash\nrate into \u201ctime slices,\u201d each encompasses a certain number of calculations over a period of time.\nThrough hash rate slicing, hash rate is divided into \u201ctime slices\u201d by algorithm instead of by manual\nintervention and then submitted to multiple mining pool accounts to support multiple users. Our\nability to generate a minimum hash rate unit of 1TH/s enables us to adjust hash rate allocation\naccurately and dynamically, and optimize operating metrics automatically in order to minimize\nfluctuations in terms of quantum in hash rate supply under Cloud Hash Rate.\nHash rate scheduling. We are able to achieve redeployment of hash rate across different mining\nmachines through hash rate scheduling. When a single machine fails, hash rate from other mining\nmachines can be instantly dispatched to ensure timing stability of hash rate supply. As a result, we\nare able to maintain a hash rate online rate of 100% under Cloud Hash Rate.\nReal-time monitoring. Minerplus supports efficient and constant monitoring, automated operation and\nmaintenance as well as data analysis for mining machines of different models under different brands,\nlocated in mining datacenters of different sizes in different locations. We have developed a highly\nefficient monitoring model adopting a procedure of prediction\u202f-\u202ffeature analysis\u202f-\u202fdata processing\u202f-\u202f\nreverse operation, which is able to accurately identify and quickly scan the monitored objects, and\nreturn operating data of the mining machine in real-time.\nClean energy. We have taken various measures to increase the ratio of clean energy in support of the\noperations of our mining datacenters. As of June 30, 2022, our non-carbon energy supply ratio\nreached approximately 53%. Our research and development team has started the feasibility\nassessment of the use of solar power to support our mining datacenters. We have also spent\nconsiderable efforts in minimizing the impact on the local environment. For example, instead of\nbuilding new plants from the ground, we renovated Panasonic\u2019s abandoned plants and Alcoa\u2019s\ndeserted aluminum smelter plants when constructing our mining datacenters in Tennessee and Texas.\nSee the section entitled \u2018\u2018- Energy\u201d above for more details.\nCompetition\nFor our proprietary mining business, we compete with mining operations throughout the world. We\ncompete to solve new blocks on the basis of our total number of mining machines, the degree of mining\ndifficulty and the efficiency of our mining. We also compete to acquire new mining machines, to obtain\naccess to facilities and prime location of mining operations, to electricity, to develop or acquire new\ntechnologies and to raise capital.\nFor our hash rate sharing business line, we compete on both the quantity and the quality of our hash\nrate supply, which depends on our mining datacenter resources, the total number of our mining machines,\nour ability to involve third-party hash rate suppliers and our access to technologies to maintain hash rate\nsupply stability. We achieved a 37.4% market share as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate\nsharing market, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, as of\nJune 30, 2022, according to Frost & Sullivan. While we face competition from hash rate suppliers like\nFROGBT, we also seek cooperation with these third-party hash rate suppliers and build synergy-generating\nrelationships by\n210 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nintroducing them to our Hash Rate Marketplace and connecting them to our hash rate users. Together with\nother market players, we make available diverse and quality hash rate products on our Hash Rate\nMarketplace, facilitate the growth of our user base, and both third-party hash rate suppliers and ourselves\ncan enjoy the faster cash payback enabled by a thriving Hash Rate Marketplace.\nFor our hosting service, we compete with other hosting operations globally. Our competitiveness\ndepends on our ability to supply hosting space and power, our deployment, management and operation\ncapabilities, the value of our service offering to customers, the availability of mining equipment and\ntechnologies, etc. Our innovative computing and hosting service \u201cgroup-buying\u201d model under Cloud\nHosting gives us a clear advantage. We also enjoy the first-mover advantage in mining datacenter\ndeployment and operation as well as mining machine management.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries for cryptocurrency mining and related services. Our\ncompetitors include Argo Blockchain PLC, Bit Digital, Inc., Bitcoin Investment Trust, Bitfarms Technologies\nLtd., Blockchain Industries, Inc, Cipher Mining Inc., Coinbase, Inc., Core Scientific, Inc., Digihost\nInternational, Inc., DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc., DPW Holdings, Inc., HashChain Technology, Inc., Hive\nBlockchain Technologies Inc., Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., Hut 8 Mining Corp., Layer1\nTechnologies, Inc., Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc., MGT Capital Investments, Inc., Northern Data AG,\nOverstock.com Inc., Riot Blockchain, Inc. and TeraWulf Inc. Many of our competitors are well-known\nworldwide players and we face competitors that are larger than us and have advantages over us in terms of\neconomies of scale and financial and other resources. Some of our competitors may also have stronger brand\nnames, greater access to capital, longer histories, longer relationships with their suppliers or customers and\nmore resources than we do. Furthermore, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in the industry\nmore promptly and efficiently. As such, we expect that competition in our markets will continue to be intense.\nIntellectual Property\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we owned eight registered patents, 10 registered\ncopyrights, 114 registered trademarks and 171 registered domain names. We are also in the process of\napplying for six registered patents. The protection of our intellectual property and all corresponding rights\nthroughout the world, including our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos, trade names, domain\nnames, goodwill, patents, copyrights, works of authorship (whether or not copyrightable), software and\ntrade secrets, know-how, and proprietary and other confidential information, together with all applications,\nregistrations, renewals, extensions, improvements and counterparts in connection with any of the foregoing,\nis important to the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by filing\napplications in various patent, trademark and other government offices, and relying on applicable laws and\nregulations in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We have\nroutinely entered into confidentiality and invention disclosure and assignment agreements with our\nemployees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with external parties with whom we conduct\nbusiness to control access to, and use and disclosure of, our proprietary information.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we had 160 full-time employees, and one part-time\nemployee. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining\nagreement. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not\nexperienced any material disputes with our employees in our history.\nSeasonality\nOur hash rate level is typically slightly lower in summer as temperature affects mining machine\nperformance regarding hash rate generation.\nGovernment Regulation\nDue to the relatively short history of cryptocurrencies, and their emergence as a new asset class,\ngovernment regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with increased interest\nexpressed by U.S. and internal regulators. For example, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the U.S. Department\n211 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof Justice published a report entitled \u201cCryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework\u201d in October 2020 that\ndetailed the Department\u2019s view with respect to cryptocurrencies and the tools at the Department\u2019s disposal\nto deal with threats posed by cryptocurrencies. In March 2021, the nominee for Chair of the SEC expressed\nthe need for investor protection along with promotion of innovation in the cryptocurrency space.\nGovernment regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is under active consideration by the United\nStates federal government via its agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as by similar entities in other\ncountries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations also may\napply to our activities and other activities in which we may participate in the future. Other governmental or\nsemi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies\nengaged in blockchain or cryptocurrency businesses. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in\nregulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called \u201cinitial coin offerings\u201d) and has made\nstatements and official promulgations as to the status of certain cryptocurrencies as \u201csecurities\u201d subject to\nregulation by the SEC.\nThe effect of any regulatory change, either by the Federal, state, local or foreign governments or any\nself-regulatory agencies on us is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we are unaware\nof significant adverse governmental or regulatory action adverse to Bitcoin or Ethereum mining in the United\nStates, there is no guarantee that future regulation or adverse action will not take place and interpretation of\nexisting regulations in a manner adverse to our business is possible.\nIn addition, various foreign jurisdictions either have adopted, or may adopt, laws, regulations or\ndirectives that affect cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency networks, and their users and participants. Such laws,\nregulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States, may negatively impact the acceptance\nof cryptocurrencies by users, merchants and service providers outside of the United States, and may\ntherefore impede the growth of cryptocurrencies. A number of Eastern European and Asian countries\ncurrently have a more restrictive stance toward cryptocurrencies and, thereby, have reduced the rate of\nexpansion of cryptocurrency use, as well as cryptocurrency transaction processing, in each of those\ncountries. Presently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position\nadverse to our main cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of\nexchange\u037e however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our\nbusiness in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability.\nAs the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further\nregulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities.\nFacilities\nOur principal executive offices are located at #09-03/04, Aperia Tower 1, 8 Kallang Avenue, Singapore\n339509, where we lease an approximately 440 square meters facility. This facility houses our administrative\nheadquarters and research and development center. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and\nadequate to meet our current needs. If we need to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add\nemployees, we believe that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any such expansion of\nour operations.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. We have been, and may\nfrom time to time in the future, be subject to various legal and administrative proceedings arising in the\nordinary course of our business. Such claims or legal actions, even if without merit, could result in the\nexpenditure of significant financial and management resources and potentially result in civil liability for\ndamages.\n212 \n",

The executive officers have also agreed to disclose in confidence to BTG all\ninventions, designs and trade secrets which they conceive, develop or reduce to practice during the\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment with BTG and to assign all rights, title and interest in them to BTG, and assist\nBTG in obtaining and enforcing patents, copyrights and other legal rights for these inventions, designs and\ntrade secrets.\nIn addition, each executive officer has agreed to be bound by non-competition and non-solicitation\nrestrictions during the term of his or her employment and typically for one year following the last date of\nemployment. Specifically, each executive officer has agreed not to (i) engage in, or otherwise directly or\nindirectly being employed by or acting as a consultant or lender to, or being a director, officer, employee,\nprincipal, agent, stockholder, member, owner or partner of, or permitting the executive officer\u2019s name to be\nused in connection with the activities of, any other business or organization which competes, directly or\nindirectly, with BTG\u037e (ii) solicit from any customer doing business with BTG during the term\u037e or (iii) otherwise\ninterfere with the business or accounts of BTG.\nBTG has also entered into indemnification agreements with each of BTG\u2019s directors and executive\nofficers. Under these agreements, BTG agrees to indemnify BTG\u2019s directors and executive officers against\ncertain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by reason of their\nbeing a director or officer of BTG.\nForeign Private Issuer Status\nBTG is an exempted company limited by shares incorporated in 2021 under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands. After the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG will report under the Exchange Act as a\nnon-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, the determination\n218 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer\u2019s most recently\ncompleted second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to BTG on\nJune 30, 2022. For so long as BTG qualifies as a foreign private issuer, it will be exempt from certain\nprovisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including:\nthe rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current\nreports on Form 8-K with the SEC\u037e\nthe sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in\nrespect of a security registered under the Exchange Act\u037e\nthe sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and\ntrading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time\u037e and\nthe selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation Fair\nDisclosure, or Regulation FD, which regulates selective disclosure of material non-public information\nby issuers.\nBTG will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal\nyear. In addition, BTG intends to publish its results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed\npursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material\nevents will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information BTG is required to file with\nor furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC\nby U.S. domestic issuers. Accordingly, after the Business Combination, BTG shareholders will receive less or\ndifferent information about BTG than a shareholder of a U.S. domestic public company would receive.\nBTG is a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status, and, after the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination, will be listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq market rules permit a foreign private issuer like BTG\nto follow the corporate governance practices of its home country. Certain corporate governance practices in\nthe Cayman Islands, which is BTG\u2019s home country, may differ significantly from Nasdaq corporate\ngovernance listing standards. Among other things, BTG is not required to have:\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors\u037e\na compensation committee consisting of independent directors\u037e\na nominating committee consisting of independent directors\u037e or\nregularly scheduled executive sessions with only independent directors each year.\nAlthough not required and as may be changed from time to time, BTG intends to have, as of the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, a majority-independent board of directors, a majority-\nindependent compensation committee and a nominating committee. Subject to the foregoing, BTG intends to\nrely on the exemptions listed above. As a result, you may not be provided with the benefits of certain\ncorporate governance requirements of Nasdaq applicable to U.S. domestic public companies.\nControlled Company Status\nAfter the completion of the Business Combination, Mr. Jihan Wu will control a majority of the voting\npower of BTG\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, BTG will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the\nmeaning of applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these corporate governance standards, a company of\nwhich more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a\n\u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including\nthe requirements (1) that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) that its\nboard of directors have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a\nwritten charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities and (3) that its board of directors\nhave a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors\nwith a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities. BTG expects to utilize these\n\u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions for at least some period following the Business Combination, as it does\nnot expect its board of directors, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee following the Business Combination to meet the afore-mentioned independence requirements.\nPending such determination, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies\nthat are subject\n219 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto all of these corporate governance requirements. If BTG ceases to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and its\nshares continue to be listed on Nasdaq, BTG will be required to comply with these standards and, depending\non the board\u2019s independence determination with respect to its then-current directors, BTG may be required\nto add additional directors to its board in order to achieve such compliance within the applicable transition\nperiods.\nDirector Independence\nAs a result of Mr. Jihan Wu holding a majority of the voting power of BTG\u2019s outstanding ordinary\nshares, BTG will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. Therefore, BTG will\nnot be required to comply with certain corporate governance rules that would otherwise apply to us as a\nlisted company on Nasdaq, including the requirement that compensation committee and nominating and\ncorporate governance committee be composed entirely of \u201cindependent\u201d directors (as defined by Nasdaq\u2019s\nlisting rules). As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d the board of directors of BTG will not be required to include a\nmajority of \u201cindependent\u201d directors.\nNonetheless, we anticipate that BTG will have three \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined in the Nasdaq\nlisting standards and applicable SEC rules. In addition, we anticipate that Guang Yang, Sheldon Trainor-\nDeGirolamo and Naphat Sirimongkolkasem will qualify as independent directors for the purpose of serving\non the audit committee of BTG under SEC rules.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nBTG has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to its directors, officers and\nemployees. BTG seeks to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. BTG\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets out the principles designed to guide BTG\u2019s\nbusiness practices\u202f-\u202fcompliance, integrity, respect and dedication. The code applies to all directors, officers,\nemployees and extended workforce, including the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nOperating Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief People Officer. Relevant sections of the code\nalso apply to members of the BTG board of directors. BTG expects its suppliers, contractors, consultants,\nand other business partners to follow the principles set forth in its code when providing goods and services\nto BTG or acting on BTG\u2019s behalf.\n220 \n",

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,\nestimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set\nforth under the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d sections and elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-\nlooking statements.\nOverview\nBitdeer is a world-leading technology company for the cryptocurrency mining community. As of June\n30, 2022, we were the world\u2019s second largest holder of proprietary hash rate, which is defined as hash rate\ngenerated from proprietary mining machines\u037e by allocating part of our proprietary hash rate for sale, we were\nthe world\u2019s largest supplier of hash rate, as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing\nmarket, which is defined as a market where players sell part of their hash rate to customers, according to\nFrost & Sullivan.\nWe mine cryptocurrencies for our own account and serve the cryptocurrency mining community by\nproviding innovative, reliable and easy-to-use cryptocurrency mining solutions. Headquartered in\nSingapore, we currently operate five proprietary mining datacenters in the United States and Norway with an\naggregate electricity capacity of 522MW as of June 30, 2022, which we had increased to 775MW by the end\nof 2022 by expanding our footprints to six mining datacenters globally. From these mining datacenters, we\ngenerate managing hash rate which is categorized into proprietary and hosting hash rate. As of June 30,\n2022, our proprietary hash rate reached 4.2 EH/s and accounted for 1.8% of the total Bitcoin network hash\nrate, making us the second largest holder of proprietary hash rate across the globe, according to Frost &\nSullivan. Together with the 6.3 EH/s hosting hash rate generated from mining machines hosted in our mining\ndatacenters, we possessed a total of 10.5 EH/s of managing hash rate as of June 30, 2022, accounting for\napproximately 4.6% of the total Bitcoin network hash rate.\nTo date, we primarily operate three business lines - \u201cproprietary mining,\u201d \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and\n\u201chosting.\u201d Proprietary mining refers to cryptocurrency mining for our own account, which allows us to\ndirectly capture the high appreciation potential of cryptocurrency. We offer two types of hash rate sharing\nsolutions, Cloud Hash Rate and Hash Rate Marketplace. Through Cloud Hash Rate, we sell our proprietary\nhash rate to customers. We offer hash rate subscription plans at fixed price and share mining income with\nthem under certain arrangements. As of June 30, 2022, our Cloud Hash Rate business achieved a market\nshare of 37.4% as measured by hash rate for sale in the cloud hash rate sharing market, according to Frost &\nSullivan. Through Hash Rate Marketplace, we connect reliable third-party hash rate suppliers with hash rate\nusers to facilitate hash rate sales and generate revenue from charging service fees. Our hosting services\noffer customers one-stop mining machine hosting solutions encompassing deployment, maintenance and\nmanagement services for efficient cryptocurrency mining. Among a wide selection of hosting services,\ncustomers can either subscribe to our Cloud Hosting service for the specified mining machines from which\nthey derive computing power under a \u201cgroup-buying\u201d model, or send their mining machines to our mining\ndatacenters for hosting under the General Hosting option or the Membership Hosting option. Historically,\nour hosting hash rate were generated from Cloud Hosting and General Hosting. All of our three business\nlines are supported by Minerplus, our self-developed integrated intelligent software platform, which offers\nsoftware support to significantly reduce time needed for daily maintenance and mining machine upgrade and\nsubstantially decrease operation and maintenance headcount. We source mining machines from a wide\nvariety of manufacturers and traders with whom we have built robust relationships over the years. We also\nengage in the sales of mining machines from time to time.\n221 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022,\nrespectively, 42.2%, 47.5%, 48.6%, 50.7% and 22.8% of our revenue was generated from proprietary mining,\nand 49.0%, 42.0%, 31.5%, 28.2% and 41.7% of our revenue was generated from Cloud Hash Rate. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, 1.6%, 1.9%, 2.7%\nand 3.8% of our revenue was generated from Cloud Hosting, a new service launched in 2020. We also\nlaunched General Hosting in 2021, which contributed 4.6%, 0.4% and 29.5% of our total revenue for the year\nended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. We generated immaterial revenue\nfrom Hash Rate Marketplace and no revenue from Membership Hosting prior to June 30, 2022. For the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, 8.5%,\n8.5%, 11.6%, 17.2% and 0.2% of our revenue was generated from the sales of mining machines.\nWe have historically achieved significant growth in recent periods. Our revenue increased by 110.0%\nfrom US$88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$186.4 million for the year ended December\n31, 2020, and further increased by 111.7% to US$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the\nfirst six months in 2022, we generated US$179.6 million in total net revenue, as compared to US$219.7 million\ngenerated for the first six months in 2021. We had gross loss of US$10.1 million and US$23.2 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and generated gross profit of US$241.4 million,\nUS$142.8 million and US$69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June\n30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We incurred net loss of US$27.9 million, US$55.8 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020, respectively, generated net profit of US$113.8 million and US$82.6 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2021, and incurred net loss of US$25.2 million\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 195.2% from US$16.5 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2019 to US$48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and further\nincreased by 479.2% to US$281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022, our adjusted EBITDA was US$68.2 million, as compared to US$183.2 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021. However, our recent growth trends may not continue and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase our profitability over the long term.\nRecent Developments\nRecent events impacting our business are as follows:\nBusiness Combination\nOn December 15, 2021, an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended\nfrom time to time, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) was entered into by and among Bitdeer Technologies Group\n(\u201cBTG\u201d), Bitdeer, Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (\u201cBSGA\u201d), Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin\nIslands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cBSGA Merger Sub 1\u201d), Blue Safari\nMerge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cBSGA\nMerger Sub 2\u201d), Bitdeer Merge Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the\nlaws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cBitdeer Merger Sub\u201d) and Blue Safari\nMini Corp. (\u201cBSGA Sub\u201d), amending and restating that agreement and plan of merger dated November 18,\n2021, by and among Bitdeer, BSGA and BSGA Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) BSGA\nMerger Sub 1 will merge with and into BSGA with BSGA being the surviving entity (the \u201cFirst SPAC\nMerger\u201d), (ii) following the First SPAC Merger, BSGA will merge with and into BSGA Merger Sub 2, with\nBSGA Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the \u201cSecond SPAC Merger,\u201d and together with the First\nSPAC Merger, the \u201cInitial Mergers\u201d), and (iii) following the Initial Mergers, Bitdeer Merger Sub will merge\nwith and into Bitdeer (the \u201cAcquisition Merger,\u201d and together with the Initial Mergers, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with\nBitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG.\nOn May 30, 2022, parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a First Amendment to Amended and\nRestated Agreement and Plan of Merger to extend the termination date upon which either BSGA or Bitdeer\nmay terminate the Merger Agreement, from May 31, 2022 to September 1, 2022.\nOn December 2, 2022, parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Second Amendment to Amended\nand Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger to further extend the termination date upon which either BSGA\n222 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nor Bitdeer may terminate the Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and\n(ii) the then applicable deadline for BSGA to complete a business combination in accordance with BSGA\u2019s\norganizational documents.\nOn March 7, 2023, parties to the Merger Agreement entered into a Third Amendment to Amended and\nRestated Agreement and Plan of Merger to revise the definition of \u201cPer Share Equity Value\u201d to the quotient\nobtained by dividing (i) US$1,180,000,000 by (ii) Bitdeer Total Shares. The parties also agreed to remove the\npreviously contemplated American Depository Share structure and instead issue ordinary shares of BTG as\nconsiderations to be paid.\nThe Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are collectively referred to\nas the \u201cBusiness Combination.\u201d The consummation of the Business Combination remains subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nReorganization\nSeparation from BitMain Technologies Holding Company\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the period from January 1, 2021 to January 26,\n2021, the Cloud Hash Rate business, the proprietary mining business and the business of providing dynamic\nhosting solutions (collectively, the \u201cBitdeer Business\u201d), and the mining pool business, including the\nownership of and registration right to the domain name btc.com (the \u201cBTC.com Pool Business\u201d or \u201cBTC\u201d),\nwere operated through a number of entities controlled by BitMain Technologies Holding Company\n(\u201cBitmain\u201d). We were created for the purpose of separating the Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool\nBusiness following a corporate reorganization of Bitmain in order to effectuate the separation. The\nseparation from Bitmain resulted in the transfer of certain assets, liabilities and contracts related to the\nBitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool Business at their historical book values from Bitmain to the\nCompany on January 26, 2021, when Bitmain distributed by way of dividend in kind the shares of the\nCompany to the then existing Bitmain shareholders. Immediately after the separation from Bitmain, the\nCompany and its subsidiaries began operating on a stand-alone basis.\nSeparation of the BTC.com Pool Business\nIn February 2021, we established Blockchain Alliance Technologies Holding Company (\u201cBlockchain\nAlliance\u201d) for the purpose of separating the BTC.com Pool Business following our corporate reorganization.\nThe separation was consummated on April 15, 2021, when we distributed by way of dividend in kind the\nshares of Blockchain Alliance to our then existing shareholders.\nBasis of Preparation\nThe combined financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and the period from\nJanuary 1, 2021 to April 15, 2021 have been prepared to capture the stand-alone Bitdeer Business, which has\nhistorically operated as part of Bitmain. The assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of the BTC.com Pool\nBusiness were also excluded from these financial statements. There are limitations inherent in the preparation\nof these financial statements since our business was previously part of a larger organization.\nThe combined statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss) for the years ended December\n31, 2019 and 2020 and the period from January 1, 2021 to April 15, 2021 include all revenue and cost directly\nattributable to the Bitdeer Business. These include certain common operating and administrative expense\nincurred by the Bitdeer Business in conjunction with other business operations of Bitmain and BTC,\nincluding financial, human resources, office administration and other support functions. These costs have\nbeen allocated on a basis considered reasonable by management using either specific identification or\nproportional allocations based on usage, headcount, or other reasonable methods of allocation.\nThe consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2021, the condensed consolidated\nstatement of financial position as of June 30, 2022, the consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive income of the Bitdeer Business for the period from April 16, 2021 to June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2021 and the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the\n223 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 are prepared on a consolidated basis. For further information on the basis of\npresentation, please refer to Note 2(a) to the combined and consolidated financial statements as of December\n31, 2020 and 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and Note 2 to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, which are\nincluded elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nKey Performance Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics presented below, to evaluate our\nbusiness and performance.\nHash Rate\nWe believe hash rate is an important metric for assessing the strength of our business. \u201cHash rate\u201d is a\nmeasure of computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a PoW blockchain,\nsuch as Bitcoin, representing the number of calculations per second that can be performed. Cryptocurrency\nmining is a competitive process in that only the first miner who solves a particular mining puzzle through\nnumerous calculations can get the mining reward. Accordingly, the more hash rate we possess, as a\npercentage of the entire network hash rate for a particular cryptocurrency, the higher possibility we have in\nresolving a block on the network blockchain, and hence a greater chance of success in obtaining\ncryptocurrency rewards. We calculate and report our hash rate in EH/s. One exahash equals one quintillion\nhashes per second. As of June 30, 2022, we possessed proprietary hash rate of 4.2 EH/s, accounting for 1.8%\nof the total Bitcoin network hash rate, according to Frost & Sullivan.\nElectricity Capacity\nElectricity capacity is another key metric to evaluate our business and operation given the energy\nintensive nature of cryptocurrency mining. Cryptocurrency mining is conducted through intensive\ncomputations, and the generation of the hash rate used in such computations requires large amounts of\nelectricity. As a result, the growth of our business, such as proprietary mining and hash rate sales through\nCloud Hash Rate, relies on a sustainable and increasing supply of a significant amount of electricity, which\nis currently supported by our proprietary mining datacenters. As of June 30, 2022, our electricity capacity\nwas 522MW.\nElectricity Cost\nAs our business operations consume a large amount of electricity and electricity cost in operating\nmining machines accounts for a significant portion of our overall cost of revenue, we strive to maintain our\nleadership position in the global electricity cost curve by building mining datacenters worldwide, where low\nelectricity cost supports stable operations. As such, we see electricity cost a key indicator of our business\nperformance. Our premier mining datacenters allowed us to successfully lower the average electricity cost of\nour mining datacenters to US$40/MWh for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was significantly below\nthe estimated global average of US$49/MWh during the same period, according to Frost & Sullivan.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measure\nIn evaluating our business, we consider and use a non-IFRS measure, adjusted EBITDA, as a\nsupplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based\npayment expenses under IFRS 2. We present this non-IFRS financial measure because they are used by our\nmanagement to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We also believe that the\nuse of this non-IFRS measure facilitates investors\u2019 assessment of our operating performance. These\nmeasures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result,\nyou should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, our profit/(loss) for\nthe periods, as determined in accordance with IFRS.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling these non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest\nIFRS performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We\nencourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n224 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of profit/(loss) for the relevant period to adjusted EBITDA\nfor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.

Hence, our ability to generate revenue from this business line is directly\naffected by the market price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price may also impact the use of our mining machines.\nOur proprietary mining business breaks even so long as it is economically beneficial for us to continue to\noperate our mining machines, and that is essentially when the mining machines contribute positive cash flow\n(i.e., when the variable cost to mine one Bitcoin, namely the electricity cost, equals the market price of a\nBitcoin). Based on this overarching principle, our electricity cost to mine one Bitcoin is approximately\nUS$10,000. Such estimate is based on the following assumptions: (i) the Bitcoin network hash rate remains\n239.4EH/s, which was the hash rate as of January 9, 2023, according to Frost & Sullivan\u037e (ii) our average\nmining machine energy consumption remains at 35.5j/T, which represents the average mining machine energy\nconsumption as of November 30, 2022\u037e and (iii) electricity cost remains at US$0.047/ kWh, which represents\nour average electricity price in November 2022. The estimate of approximately US$10,000 is essentially the\n\u201cshutdown Bitcoin price\u201d for our proprietary mining business, indicating that as long as the Bitcoin price is\nhigher than US$10,000, we would continue to operate our mining machines and such operation would be\neconomically beneficial to us.\nAccording to Frost & Sullivan, the Bitcoin price as of December 31, 2022 was US$16,576 per Bitcoin and\nthe average daily price of Bitcoin in 2022 was approximately US$28,254 per Bitcoin. Hence, we expect our\nproprietary mining activities to continue to recoup cash unless the Bitcoin price experiences a drastic drop to\nclose to half of the current price. See the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Bitdeer - Risks\nRelated to Bitdeer\u2019s Business, Operations, Industry and Financial Condition - Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations\nhave been and are expected to continue to be significantly impacted by Bitcoin price fluctuation.\u201d In\naddition, the depreciation and impairment potential of our mining machines may be affected by the volatility\nof the market prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. See the section entitled \u201c- Our ability to procure\nmining machines at a lower cost\u201d below. On the other hand, a drop in Bitcoin price may also create an\nopportunity for us to add cheaper mining machines to our mining fleets. We also generate a large percentage\nof revenue from Cloud Hash Rate, which offers hash rate to be utilized by third-party miners. As a result,\nrevenue from this business line is also correlated with Bitcoin price and volatility.\nThe appreciation potential of Bitcoin is high due to several factors. Bitcoins are inherently scarce, given\nthey are designed to have a finite supply of 21 million associated with a depreciating rewarding mechanism,\n225 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntermed \u201chalving,\u201d under which the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is reduced in half every four years.\nThe growing recognition of Bitcoins also attracts large investment into the Bitcoin economy, as evidenced\nby an increasing installed network hash rate of Bitcoin globally, and increasing adoption of Bitcoin as an\ninvestment instrument and a payment method. Further, more countries are establishing clear and robust\nregulations to create a more stable environment for Bitcoin mining and trading, which may facilitate the\ndemand for Bitcoins and Bitcoin price appreciation. The Bitcoin price has soared by 236% from the last peak\nat US$20,089 on December 17, 2017 to US$67,562 on November 9, 2021, according to Frost & Sullivan.\nHowever, there are a number of other factors that contribute to changes in Bitcoin price and volatility,\nincluding, but not limited to, Bitcoin market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, utility of Bitcoin, and\nidiosyncratic events such as exchange outages or social media. These factors have contributed to the\ndepreciation of Bitcoin. For example, recent industry-wide developments, including the continued industry-\nwide fallout from the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of cryptocurrency exchanges FTX (including its\naffiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, crypto miners Compute\nNorth and Core Scientific and crypto lenders Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and BlockFi, have led to a\ndrop in Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin price has dropped significantly from its last peak on November 9, 2021 to\nUS$15,986 on November 22, 2022, its lowest point since the last peak.\nWhile we have seen clear growth in both of our proprietary mining and Cloud Hash Rate business, we\nhave limited ability to predict Bitcoin price and its volatility, which we expect to continue to affect our future\nearnings and cash flows.\nBitcoin Price, January 2016\u202f-\u202fDecember 2022\nSource: Frost & Sullivan\nOur ability to maintain our leadership position in proprietary hash rate\nA prevailing strategy to profit from proprietary hash rate is mining. The cryptocurrencies mined can be\nsold at a profit when their market value is high enough to cover the cost of mining machines, electricity fees\nand other mining-related expenses. Bitcoins are intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult\nto mine, rendering hash rate critical in the mining industry. Possessing a higher share of network hash rate\ntranslates to a higher likelihood of generating mining awards.\nWe strive to maintain our leadership position in proprietary hash rate. In particular, we have established\na business model that allows us to constantly reinforce our market-leading position and outpace our\ncompetitors in terms of scaling up our proprietary hash rate. We strategically allocate a significant amount of\nproprietary hash rate to hash rate sales through our Cloud Hash Rate business, to enable instant cash pay-\nback upon customers\u2019 subscription to our hash rate plans. We generally generate proceeds from hash rate\nsales under long-term hash rate subscription plans that approximate the purchase cost of mining machines.\nWe are able to achieve such a premium against mining machine purchase cost as our hash rate subscription\nplans save hash rate buyers the efforts from complex mining operation and maintenance and have built brand\nrecognition among customers. Therefore, we are able to continuously grow our proprietary hash rate by\nfunding the purchase of additional mining fleets with the instant cash collected from hash rate sales using\nour existing mining fleets, significantly reducing our pay-back period to one month, compared to the long\npay-back period\n226 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nassociated with cryptocurrency mining activities, which is typically from 6 to 18 months, according to Frost\n& Sullivan. We intend to continuously scale up our infrastructure and proprietary hash rate in this efficient\nmanner in order to maintain and reinforce our leading position in proprietary hash rate. However, whether we\ncan achieve a premium through this model depends on various factors, such as the supply and demand in\nboth mining machines and global mining datacenters, whether miners prefer conducting mining operations\non their own and technology advancements. Short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations is another contributing\nfactor as quickly adjusting the pricing of our hash rate subscriptions plans to reflect such price change is\ndifficult, if not impossible. Whether this approach will remain effective will affect our ability to add more\nmining fleets to support the scale-up of our infrastructure and hash rate.\nOur ability to procure mining machines at a lower cost\nDepreciation of mining machines remained one of the few largest costs we incurred in our business\noperations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and\n2022. Depreciation of mining machines is directly affected by the purchase price of these machines.\nAlong with the increase in market value of cryptocurrencies, the demand for the most recent and\nefficient mining machines has also increased, leading to scarcity in the supply of and thereby an increase in\nthe price of mining machines. As a result, the cost of new machines can be unpredictable, and could also be\nsignificantly higher than our historical cost for new mining machines. Based on our well-established network\nwith upstream mining machine suppliers and traders, we believe that we are able to secure spot machines for\nthe most recent and most commonly used models at a relatively low price for a majority of our mining\nmachines and thereby lowering depreciation of mining machines. On the other hand, a decrease in market\nvalue of cryptocurrencies may present opportunities for us to procure cheaper mining machines. For\nexample, in light of the recent decrease and volatility of Bitcoin price, we are in the process of establishing a\nfund to purchase mining machines from financially distressed miners, if the value and quality of such mining\nmachines are satisfactory to us.\nHowever, whether we are able to successfully procure mining machines at a low price is subject to a\nnumber of factors, including our brand strength, our mining machine purchase channels, and supply and\ndemand of mining machines, some of which may not be entirely within our control. Even if we are able to\nprocure mining machines at a lower cost, the depreciation and impairment potential of our mining machines\nmay nevertheless be affected by the volatility of the market prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We\nmay need to reconsider the appropriateness of the current useful life, the residual value and the depreciation\nmethod of our mining machines based on the change in cryptocurrency prices on a yearly or more frequently\nbasis. In addition to the reassessment of depreciation, we may also need to assess whether any indications\nare present which will result in impairments of our mining machines. For example, impairments may be\nnecessary if the expected operating profits from the mining machines show a significant decline from\nprevious forecasts, which may be caused if the market price of Bitcoin drops below the mining machine shut-\ndown price.\nOur ability to effectively maintain our leadership position in the global electricity cost curve\nElectricity cost was the other largest cost, besides depreciation of mining machines, that we incurred in\nour business operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2022.\nOur ability to secure ample power supply with low electricity cost is underpinned by our top-notch\nglobal mining datacenters deployment and operation experience and capabilities. We pioneer in deploying\nand operating mining datacenters globally. Our dedicated global team for mining datacenter construction\nunderstands the critical needs of mining as well as the complex and continuously evolving global landscape\nof electricity supply. They also have extensive connections with local electricity experts and power\nenterprises around the world, giving us a clear advantage in mining datacenter construction, and hence in\nelectricity capacity and electricity costs among our competitors. We were able to optimize our electricity cost\nstructure and successfully lowered the average electricity cost of our proprietary mining datacenters to\nUS$40/MWh for the year ended 2021, which was significantly below the estimated global average of\nUS$49/MWh during the same period, according to Frost & Sullivan. Whether our current cost-saving efforts\nor our forward strategy in this regard is effective for maintaining our leadership position in the global\nelectricity cost curve will affect our ability to control our costs.\n227 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOur business judgments regarding pricing strategy and resource allocation\nOur business operations involve constant and important decision-making regarding the pricing of our\nproducts and services as well as allocation of mining resources. Our pricing strategy is based on our\nestimates of market trends. As we operate three business lines, we have to decide the allocation of\nproprietary hash rate between \u201cproprietary mining\u201d and \u201chash rate sharing\u201d as well as the allocation of\nmining datacenter capacity among \u201cproprietary mining\u201d, \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and \u201chosting\u201d. While allocating\nmore mining resources to \u201chash rate sharing\u201d and \u201chosting\u201d services may facilitate cash payback and mining\ndatacenter expansion, we have to forgo Bitcoin\u2019s huge appreciation potential to some extent as we could\nearn more Bitcoins by allocating the same mining resources to \u201cproprietary mining\u201d, and vice versa. We\nspend great efforts in making decisions in the Company\u2019s best interest, taking into account Bitcoin price,\nnetwork hash rate, the amount of cash we need and our view on the market opportunities for acquiring\nmining machines or expanding mining datacenters at low cost, etc. However, we cannot guarantee that our\ndecisions could bring the Company the best results every time, and we anticipate our business judgments\nwill continue to affect the results of our operations.\nOur ability to upgrade and expand our offerings\nCrypto-economy is characterized by continuous fluctuations and frequent innovations. Therefore, our\nfuture success is dependent on our ability to diversify our income structure to reduce exposure to\nfluctuations of the price of Bitcoin, the most significant type of cryptocurrency involved in our business\noperation, and maintain our market-leading position by upgrading and expanding our offerings. We launched\nMinerplus in January 2021 to improve operational efficiency for our proprietary mining business and miner\ncustomers. We expect to further expand our hosting service and generate more revenue from the service. We\nare in the process of building an efficient hash rate trading marketplace connecting third-party hash rate\nsuppliers and hash rate buyers. We intend to enrich our product and service portfolio by providing mining\nservices covering new crypto protocols, including Proof-of-Stake (\u201cPoS\u201d), Delegated Proof-of-Stake\n(\u201cDPoS\u201d), Proof-of-Spacetime (\u201cPoSt\u201d) and Proof-of-Capacity (\u201cPoC\u201d), and steadily increase the weight of\nnew business to diversify revenue streams and attract new customers who are users of these new crypto\nprotocols.\nAlthough we have accumulated extensive expertise and know-how in the cryptocurrency industry, we\nare only at an earlier stage of executing our offering expansion plan. Upgrading existing offerings and\ncommencing new businesses may incur significant costs and experience a prolonged ramp-up period.\nAlthough we expect these investments to benefit our business over the long term, we also expect our total\noperating expenses will increase for the foreseeable future. If any adverse development in such new\nbusinesses arises, we may not be able to develop those new businesses as successfully as contemplated, or\nat all, and our results of operations and prospects may be significantly and negatively affected as a result.\nRegulatory environment\nWe are a leading cryptocurrency mining service provider with a strong global presence. As of June 30,\n2022, we operate five prime mining datacenters in the United States and Norway and have served users\nacross over 100 countries and regions around the globe, and may continue to expand our operations to more\ncountries and regions. Each of our business line is subject to government regulation in each jurisdiction in\nwhich we operate and various jurisdictions may from time to time adopt laws, regulations or directives that\naffect our businesses. We are subject to regulatory risks with regards to mining, holding, using, or\ntransferring cryptocurrencies, etc., and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment and our ability to\nanticipate and respond to potential changes in government policies and regulations will have a significant\nimpact on our business operations in countries we operate in and our overall results of operations.\nRegulations have impacted or could impact, among others, the nature of and scope of offerings we are able\nto make available, the pricing of offerings on our platform, our relationship with, and incentives, fees and\ncommissions provided to or charged from our business partners, our ability to operate in certain segments of\nour business. We expect that our ability to manage our relationships with regulators in each of our markets,\nas well as existing and evolving regulations will continue to impact our results in the future.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020,\nand the subsequent restrictive measures including social distancing, quarantine imposed by the\ngovernments\n228 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naround the world, and related travel and trade restrictions have caused disruption to businesses and resulted\nin significant global economic impacts. COVID-19 has also impacted the payment efficiency of certain of our\ncustomers. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, these impacts have not had a significant effect\non our financial results or operations and liquidity. At present, we are generally conducting business and\noperations as usual.\nThe global impact of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the\nsituation and the effects on our business and operations closely. We do not yet know the full extent of\npotential impacts on our business or operations or on the global economy as a whole, particularly if the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. Given the uncertainty, we cannot\nreasonably estimate the impact on our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. See the\nsection entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u202f-\u202fThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significantly negative impact on the\nglobal economy, industry and market conditions. The ongoing development and the global control on the\npandemic are unclear, which may increase the instability of Bitdeer\u2019s development, materially and adversely\naffecting Bitdeer\u2019s results of operations.\u201d for further details.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from (i) proprietary mining, (ii) hash rate sales through Cloud Hash Rate, (iii)\nCloud Hosting, (iv) General Hosting, (v) sales of mining machines and (vi) others, which mainly consist of\nthe provision of management services and the sale of mining machine peripherals. Historically, we only\naccepted cryptocurrency for Cloud Hosting. For our other products and services available to customers, we\naccept both fiat currency and cryptocurrencies as payment.\nProprietary Mining\nWe enter into contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power generated from our\nown mining machines to the mining pools. The contracts with mining pool operators are terminable at any\ntime by either party. In exchange for providing computing power to the mining pool, we are entitled to\ncryptocurrency rewards from the mining pool operators, which is a variable consideration calculated based\non a predetermined formula agreed by us and the mining pool operator as a part of the arrangement. The\nvariable consideration is constrained until we can reasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the\nend of a given day based on the actual amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operators.\nBy then, we consider it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenues will not occur\nand includes such variable consideration in the transaction price. Providing computing power is an output of\nour ordinary activities and the only performance obligation in our contracts with mining pool operators. We\nrecognize the revenue when the variable consideration is no longer constrained and the performance\nobligation of providing computing power has been satisfied. As a result, we do not present disaggregated\nrevenue information on block rewards and transaction verification fees.\nCloud Hash Rate\nThrough Cloud Hash Rate, customers can subscribe to a specified amount of computing power derived\nfrom the mining machines held by us for a period of time through a wide selection of hash rate subscription\nplans offered by us, differentiated by plan duration and the type of cryptocurrency to be mined. By\nsubscribing to the hash rate subscription plan, the customers are able to direct the computing power\nprovided by us to be connected to a customer-designated mining pool for a period of time. As a result of\ndirecting the connection of such computing power to the mining pools, the customers are entitled to the\nmining rewards, which are directly transferred from mining pools to the customer-designated cryptocurrency\nwallets. Customers pay a fixed amount for the subscribed hash rate at the commencement of the plans. The\nrevenue related to hash rate subscriptions is amortized ratably throughout the duration of the plan. The\ncustomer also needs to separately pay for electricity subscriptions to maintain the mining machines that\nproduce the subscribed hash rate. The revenue related to electricity subscriptions is recognized ratably\nthroughout the duration of each respective electricity subscription. The price of electricity subscription is\nfixed at the commencement of each electricity subscription. The hash rate subscription plans are offered\nunder two modes. Under the classic mode, the\n229 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncustomer receives all of the mining rewards from the mining pool. Under the accelerator mode, the customer\npays a relatively lower computing power subscription fee. In exchange, we are entitled to additional\nconsideration once the customer\u2019s cost is recovered. The additional consideration is determined as a\npercentage of a customer\u2019s mining profit derived from the subscribed computing power. We accept both\ncryptocurrency and fiat currency as payments under the Cloud Hash Rate arrangements.\nCloud Hosting\nThrough Cloud Hosting, we provide our customers one-stop mining machines hosting solution that\nintegrates the provision of computing power generated from the specified second-hand mining machines and\nthe provision of maintenance service, which primarily includes electricity supply and daily maintenance and\nrepair care. We charge our customers an upfront amount at the commencement of the Cloud Hosting\narrangements so the customers can secure the procurement of the computing power from the specified\nmining machines and the corresponding revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service, which\napproximates to the life of the specified mining machines and is estimated to be two years, and maintenance\nservice fee, based on the consumption of resources, such as electricity, and the corresponding revenue is\nrecognized across each service cycle. The estimated life of these mining machines is reviewed at least at each\nfinancial year-end and adjusted if the expectation of the realization of economic benefits from the specified\nmining machines is different from the previous estimate. The Cloud Hosting arrangements are offered under\ntwo modes. Under the classic mode, the customer receives all of the mining rewards from the mining pool.\nUnder the accelerator mode, the customer is charged with a lower upfront amount and enjoys a quicker\nrecovery of the costs. In exchange, we are entitled to additional consideration once a customer\u2019s cost is\nrecovered. The additional consideration is determined as a percentage of a customer\u2019s mining profit derived\nfrom the computing power of the specified mining machines. No revenue was generated from the additional\nconsideration from Cloud Hosting arrangements offered under the accelerator mode for all the periods\npresented. The additional transaction price is determined as a percentage of a customer\u2019s mining profit\nderived from the hash rate of the specified mining machines. We did not generate any revenue from the\nadditional consideration from Cloud Hosting arrangements offered under the \u201caccelerated payback mode\u201d\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. We\nhistorically only accept cryptocurrency as payments for services under the Cloud Hosting arrangements.\nUnder the Cloud Hosting arrangements, our customers\u2019 ability to direct the use of, and to obtain\nsubstantially all of the remaining benefits from, the mining machines is limited while the mining machines are\nin our possession. We have determined that we still retain control over the mining machines and\nconsequently, the mining machines under the Cloud Hosting arrangements were not derecognized from our\nbook.\nGeneral Hosting\nWe provide General Hosting services that enable our customers to run blockchain computing\noperations. The service fee is charged to our customers monthly on a consumption basis, such as the\namount of electricity used in a period, based on the customer\u2019s use of such resources. Revenue from the\nGeneral Hosting service is recognized across each service cycle. We accept both cryptocurrency and fiat\ncurrency as payments for the provision of custody and maintenance service.\nSales of Mining Machines\nWe engage in the sales of mining machines on hand from time to time. We sell mining machines on hand\nwhen, based on our judgement, selling machines of older models can (i) facilitate cash payback while\nmaintaining a reasonable profit range compared to utilizing them for our own operations and (ii) optimize the\nefficiency of our mining fleets. Factors we considered include market conditions, capacity availability in our\nmining datacenters and the availability of new-generation mining machines that are more efficient. We\nrecognize revenue from sales of mining machines to customers at the point in time when control of the\nmining machines is transferred to our customers, which generally occurs upon shipment of the mining\nmachines as defined in the contract. We accept both cryptocurrency and fiat currency as payments for\nmining machine purchase.\nOthers\nWe also generate immaterial revenue for all periods under discussion from other operations, which\nmainly include the provision of management services and the sale of mining machine peripherals.\n230 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of (i) electricity expenses incurred for operating our mining\nmachines in the revenue-generating activities, (ii) depreciation expense from the mining machines and the\nmining datacenters hosting those mining machines, (iii) compensation expenses incurred by mining\ndatacenter personnel and (iv) cost of mining machines sold to customers.\nElectricity Cost in Operating Mining Machines\nWe incur electricity costs when (i) operating proprietary mining machines for cryptocurrency mining, (ii)\ngenerating hash rate for sales under Cloud Hash Rate, (iii) operating specified mining machines for\ncustomers under Cloud Hosting and (iv) operating customer-owned mining machines during the provision of\nGeneral Hosting services.\nDepreciation of Mining Machines and Mining Datacenters\nDepreciation on our mining machines is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost up to\nresidual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We estimate the useful life of mining machines\nprimarily based on the historical measures of (i) the period when each mining machine is able to deliver\nexpected performance and (ii) the frequency of technological advancement, which leads to new generation of\nmining machines. We also estimate the residual value of the mining machines at the expected time of\ndisposal, taking into consideration factors such as make and model. The depreciation method, useful life and\nresidual value of the mining machines are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and adjusted, if\nappropriate. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we estimated the useful lives of the mining\nmachines to be one year. The useful life for mining machines was changed from one year to one to two years\nsince the year ended December 31, 2021 for the mining machines of newer models that were purchased in\n2021 as a result of the review conducted in July 2021.\nDepreciation of mining datacenters is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets comprised thereof, such as buildings, machinery, electronic equipment and\nleasehold improvement, and is recorded under depreciation of property, plant, and equipment. The\ndepreciation method, useful life and residual value of these asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-\nend and adjusted if appropriate.\nCompensation Expenses Incurred by Mining Datacenter Personnel\nThe compensation expenses incurred by mining datacenter personnel consists primarily of (i) share-\nbased payment expenses related to mining datacenter personnel as a result of the grant of options under the\n2021 Share Incentive Plan and (ii) staff costs, including salaries, wages and other benefits in relation to\nmining datacenter personnel.\nCost of Mining Machines Sold\nThe cost of mining machines sold is incurred when we sell our mining machines that have been used for\nour business operations. It is recognized at the net book value of the associated mining machines.\nGross Profit/(Loss)\nOur gross profit or loss is primarily affected by (i) Bitcoin prices, which have a significant and direct\neffect on the amount of revenue we recognized from our operations, (ii) depreciation of mining machines,\nwhich is directly related to the mining machine purchases we made, (iii) electricity costs, (iv) staff cost,\nincluding salaries, wages and other benefits, (v) cost of mining machines sold and (vi) share-based payment\nexpenses.\nOperating Expenses/(Income)\nSelling Expenses\nOur selling expenses primarily consist of (i) staff costs, including wages, bonuses and benefits to sales\npersonnel, (ii) promotional expenses, which primarily represent expenses incurred for online and offline\n231 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmarketing activities and other promotional activities to reach more customers, and (iii) share-based payment\nexpenses related to marketing personnel.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of (i) staff costs, including wages, bonuses\nand benefits to general and administrative personnel, (ii) consulting service expenses, and (iii) share-based\npayment expenses related to administrative personnel.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of (i) staff costs, including wages, bonuses\nand benefits to research and development personnel, and (ii) share-based payment expenses related to\nresearch and development personnel. We invest significant research and development resources in\nimproving technology related to our Cloud Hash Rate business including hash rate slicing, developing Hash\nRate Marketplace and improve our Minerplus features like virus detection and hash rate monitoring. We\nalso spent R&D efforts on utilizing renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency.\nOther Operating Income/(Expenses)\nOur other operating income/expenses primarily consist of (i) net gain/losses on disposal of\ncryptocurrencies, (ii) net loss on disposal of mining machine, and (iii) write-off of receivables from related\nparties.\nOther Net Gain/(Loss)\nOther net gain/loss primarily consist of (i) net gain on settlement of balances between Bitmain, (ii)\ngain/losses on disposal of property, plant, and equipment, and (iii) impairment loss of a pre-matured\ninvestment.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarizes our results of operations, revenue breakdown, and expenses by nature\nfor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. This\ninformation should be read together with our combined and consolidated financial statements and\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus.

Months Ended June 30, 2021 and 2022\nRevenue\nOur revenue decreased by 18.2% from US$219.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to\nUS$179.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.\n234 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nRevenue generated from our proprietary mining business decreased by 63.2% from US$111.3 million\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2021 to US$41.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The\nchange was mainly driven by (i) the price drop of Bitcoin, the most significant type of cryptocurrency\ninvolved in our business operation and (ii) a decrease in the comparative number of Bitcoin mined\nfrom proprietary mining, resulting from a decrease in the amount of hash rate allocated to our\nproprietary mining business as a percentage of the total network hash rate. The average price of\nBitcoin for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $36,978.8 compared to $45,847.9 for the six months\nended June 30, 2021, representing a decrease of 19.3%, according to Frost & Sullivan. The network\nhash rate, calculated on a six-month monthly average basis, increased by 48.4% from 140.5EH/s for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2021 to 208.5EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2022, according to\nFrost & Sullivan. The hash rate used for proprietary mining, calculated on a six-month monthly\naverage basis, was approximately 2.0EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was slightly\ndecreased compared to 2.2EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2021 . We expect to remain flexible\nin allocating hash rate between proprietary mining and hash rate sales through Cloud Hash Rate,\ndepending on the market condition.\nRevenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate increased by 20.8% from US$62.0 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021 to US$74.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was mainly\nattributable to an increase in (i) revenue from hash rate subscription and (ii) revenue from electricity\nsubscription, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from additional consideration from acceleration\nplan arrangements. Sales price of hash rate subscription is primarily priced with reference to Bitcoin\nprice and overall network hash rate at the time of sales and revenue generated from the subscription\nis recognized evenly over the duration of the subscription. As a result, revenue from hash rate\nsubscription for the six months ended June 30, 2022 did not only consist of new sales during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 but also the amortized revenue from sales before 2022 and that captured\nthe Bitcoin price appreciation during 2021. According to Frost & Sullivan, the average Bitcoin price\nfor 2020, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 was US$11,057.0, US$47,385.2 and US$36,978.8,\nrespectively. The network hash rate for 2020 and 2021, calculated on a twelve-month monthly average\nbasis, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022, calculated on a six-month monthly average basis,\nwas 123.0EH/s, 140.2EH/s and 208.5EH/s, respectively, according to Frost & Sullivan. We have also\nslightly increased hash rate allocated to Cloud Hash Rate, calculated on a six-month monthly average\nbasis, from 2.0EH/s for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to 2.2EH/s for the six months ended June\n30, 2022. The increase in electricity subscription was as a result of a slight increase in electricity price\nfor existing customers of Cloud Hash Rate. The decrease in revenue from additional consideration\nfrom Cloud Hash Rate arrangements offered under accelerator mode was due to the expiration of our\nexisting revenue sharing arrangements subscribed in the prior year and a delay in reaching the\ncondition for revenue sharing due to generally longer subscription periods and lower-than-expected\nmining rewards.\nRevenue generated from sales of mining machines decreased by 98.8% from US$37.8 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 to US$0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was\nmainly attributable to a decrease in the number of mining machines we sold for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022 as we had sold most of our mining machines of older models for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021.\nRevenue generated from Cloud Hosting increased by 13.0% from US$6.0 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021 to US$6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was mainly\nattributable to a slight increase in electricity price for the existing customers of Cloud Hosting.\nRevenue generated from General Hosting increased significantly from US$0.9 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 to US$53.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily\ndriven by an increase in the mining site capacity as a result of the expansion of our mining datacenter\noperations in North America.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue increased by 43.9% from US$76.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to\nUS$110.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in (i) electricity cost\nin operating mining machines, (ii) share-based payment expenses, (iii) salaries, wages and other benefits and\n235 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(iv) depreciation of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in (i) depreciation of mining\nmachines and (ii) cost of mining machines sold and accessories sold.\nDepreciation of mining machines decreased by 55.9% from US$34.1 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 to US$15.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily because (i) a\nsignificant number of the mining machines procured prior to 2021 as a result of our expanded hash\nrate capacity are fully depreciated by the first half of 2021, and (ii) we changed the useful life for\nmining machines from one year to two years for the mining machines of newer models that were\npurchased starting from July 2021, which leads to lower depreciation afterwards.\nElectricity cost in operating mining machines increased by 130.5% from US$25.7 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 to US$59.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was\nattributed to the increased overall energy consumption related to the expansion of our mining\ndatacenter operations in North America.\nCost of mining machines sold and accessories sold decreased by 87.5% from US$4.6 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 to US$0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven\nby the decrease in the number of mining machines we sold for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as\nwe had sold most of our mining machines of older models for the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nShare-based payment expenses attributed to cost of revenue increased from nil for the six months\nended June 30, 2021 to US$5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was due to the\ngrant of options to attract and retain quality employees for the Group under the 2021 Share Incentive\nPlan approved in July 2021.\nSalaries, wages and other benefits attributed to cost of revenue increased by 136.4% from US$2.7\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to US$6.5 million for the six months ended June\n30,2022, which was due to the increase in salaries, wages and other benefits to attract and retain\nquality employees as a result of the expansion of our mining datacenter operations in North America.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment attributed to cost of revenue increased by 78.7% from\nUS$6.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to US$11.7 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the expansion of our mining facilities.\nSelling Expenses\nOur selling expenses increased significantly from US$0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021\nto US$6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to (i) the US$4.5 million increase in\nshare based payment expenses as a result of the grant of options to sales personnel under the 2021 Share\nIncentive Plan approved in July 2021, and (ii) the US$0.6 million increase in staff costs, including salaries,\nwages and benefits to sales personnel.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by 374.1% from US$11.1 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021 to US$52.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to (i) the\nUS$29.3 million increase in share-based payment expenses as a result of the grant of option to administrative\npersonnel under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan approved in July 2021, and (ii) the US$7.1 million increase in\nstaff costs, including salaries, wages and benefits to general and administrative personnel.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased by 484.1% from US$3.4 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021 to US$19.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to (i) the\nUS$14.9 million increase in share-based payment expenses as a result of the grant of option to research and\ndevelopment personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan approved in July 2021, and (ii) the US$1.5 million\nincrease in staff costs, including salaries, wages and benefits to research and development personnel.\n236 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Operating Income /(Expenses)\nWe generated other operating income of US$14.3 million and incurred other operating expenses of\nUS$2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. This change was primarily\nbecause we recorded US$16.4 million gain on disposal of cryptocurrencies for the six months ended June 30,\n2021, compared to US$2.2 million loss on disposal of cryptocurrencies for the six months ended June 30,\n2022, which is associated with Bitcoin price drop prior to such disposal given we typically sell Bitcoins\nearned from our principal business lines within the next few days.\nOther Net Gain/(Loss)\nWe recorded other net gain of US$1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which primarily\nincluded (i) net gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment of US$0.6 million and (ii) others of US$0.6\nmillion, which mainly included return of wealth management product and other minor gains from operation.\nWe recorded other net loss of US$1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, which primarily included\na one-off impairment loss of approximately US$2.0 million resulting from a pre-mature investment.\nProfit/(Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, we recorded a loss from operations of US$11.4 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 and a profit from operations of US$140.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nIncome Tax Benefit/(Expenses)\nWe recorded income tax expenses of US$26.6 million and US$8.0 million for the six months ended June\n30, 2021 and 2022.\nNet Profit/(Loss)\nAs a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net loss of US$25.2 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2022 and a net profit of US$113.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2021\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased by 111.7% from US$186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to\nUS$394.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenue generated from our proprietary mining business increased by 116.6% from US$88.5 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 to US$191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The\nchange was mainly driven by price appreciation of Bitcoin, the most significant type of\ncryptocurrency involved in our business operation, partially offset by a decrease in the number of\nBitcoin mined, primarily resulting from the Bitcoin halving event on May 11, 2020 and a slight\ndecrease in the hash rate allocated to proprietary mining. The average price of Bitcoin for the year\nended December 31, 2021 was US$47,385 compared to US$11,057 for the year ended December 31,\n2020, representing an increase of 328.5%, according to Frost & Sullivan. The hash rate used for\nproprietary mining, calculated on a twelve-month monthly average basis, was approximately 2.2EH/s\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, which was slightly decreased compared to 2.3EH/s for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nRevenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate increased by 58.7% from US$78.3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2020 to US$124.2 million for year ended December 31, 2021, which was mainly\nattributable to the increase in (i) revenue from additional consideration from acceleration plan\narrangements and (ii) revenue from hash rate subscription, partially offset by a decrease in electricity\ncharges as a result of lower hash rate allocated to Cloud Hash Rate in 2021. The increase in revenue\ngenerated from additional consideration from acceleration plan arrangements was due to the launch of\nsubscription plans under \u201caccelerator mode\u201d in 2020, an increase in the number of customers who\n237 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecovered their investment costs in 2021 as well as Bitcoin price appreciation. The increase in revenue\nfrom hash rate subscription was mainly driven by the higher sales price of hash rate subscription and\nthe higher demand for Cloud Hash Rate, both of which were primarily attributable to (i) Bitcoin price\nappreciation, and (ii) our increased brand recognition as a result of our expanding scale of operations\nas well as diverse hash rate subscription plans and high-quality hash rate. The hash rate allocated to\nCloud Hash Rate, calculated on a twelve-month monthly average basis, was approximately 2.0EH/s\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, which was slightly decreased compared to 2.1EH/s for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nRevenue generated from sales of mining machines increased by 188.4% from US$15.8 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 to US$45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was\nmainly attributable to the higher sales price of mining machines driven by Bitcoin price appreciation,\noffset by the decrease in the number of mining machines we sold in 2021.\nRevenue generated from Cloud Hosting increased by 158.4% from US$2.9 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 to US$7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was mainly\nattributable to an increase in the customer base of Cloud Hosting following the launch of Cloud\nHosting service in 2020.\nRevenue generated from General Hosting increased from nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 to\nUS$18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by (i) professional miners\u2019\nhigher demand for hosting services in 2021, (ii) the increase in mining site capacity as a result of the\nexpansion of our mining datacenter operations and (iii) our efforts to attract more hosting customers\nto diversify our revenue stream.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue decreased by 26.9% from US$209.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to\nUS$153.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by decrease in (i) depreciation of\nmining machines, (ii) the electricity cost in operating mining machines and (iii) cost of mining machine sold,\npartially offset by an increase in share-based payment expenses attributed to cost of revenue, increase in\nsalaries, wages, and other benefits attributed to cost of revenue and increase in depreciation of property,\nplant and equipment attributed to cost of revenue.\nDepreciation of mining machines decreased by 55.3% from US$98.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 to US$43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily because (i) the\nmining machines procured at the beginning of 2020 as a result of our expanded hash rate capacity\ncontributed large depreciation amount for the year ended December 31, 2020, and are fully depreciated\nby the first half of 2021 as those mining machines were depreciated in one year on a straight-line\nbasis, and (ii) we changed the useful life for mining machines from one year to one to two years for\nthe mining machines of newer models that were purchased in 2021 starting from July 2021, which\nleads to lower depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nElectricity cost in operating mining machines decreased by 18.9% from US$72.1 million for the year\nended December 31, 2020 to US$58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by\nthe lowered overall energy consumption of 39.2 j/T as of December 31, 2021, compared to 48 j/T as of\nDecember 31, 2020 for our mining machines, partially offset by the increase in managing hash rate\ncalculated on a twelve-month average basis from approximately 4.6EH/s for the year ended December\n31, 2020 to approximately 5.7EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCost of mining machines sold decreased by 65.9% from US$17.5 million for the year ended December\n31, 2020 to US$6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by (i) the lower\ncarrying book value of the mining machines sold in 2021 as the mining machines sold in 2021 were\nused for a longer period with most of their costs depreciated compared to the ones sold in 2020 and\n(ii) decrease in the number of mining machines sold in 2021.\nShare-based payment expenses attributed to cost of revenue increased from nil for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 to US$10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was due to the\ngrant of options under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan to mining datacenter personnel in the second\nhalf of 2021.\n238 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSalaries, wages and other benefits attributed to cost of revenue increased by 99.4% from US$4.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to US$9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,\nwhich was due to the increase in salaries, wages and other benefits to mining datacenter personnel as\na result of the expansion of our mining datacenter operations.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment attributed to cost of revenue increased by 47.0% from\nUS$9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to US$14.0 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021, primarily attributable to our expansion of the mining datacenter.\nSelling Expenses\nOur selling expenses increased by 51.8% from US$5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to\nUS$8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the US$5.2 million increase in share-\nbased payment expenses attributed to selling expense as a result of the grant of options to sales personnel\nunder the 2021 Share Incentive Plan in the second half of 2021, partially offset by US$1.4 million decrease in\nstaff costs, including salaries, wages and benefits to sales personnel and the US$1.3 million decrease in\nadvertising expenses, as we conducted fewer marketing activities. As a result of price appreciation of\nBitcoin, the most significant cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, and wider market\nrecognition of our brand name, we are able to achieve satisfying sales performance without engaging in\nproactive marketing activities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by 342.7% from US$20.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 to US$89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) US$54.5\nmillion increase in share-based payment expenses attributed to general and administrative expenses as a\nresult of the grant of option to administrative personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive Plan in the second\nhalf of 2021, (ii) US$7.5 million increase in consulting service fees attributed to general and administrative\nexpenses charged by professional parties due to our efforts in capital market activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased by 201.3% from US$9.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 to US$29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to (i)\nUS$18.2 million increase in share-based payment expenses attributed to research and development expenses\nof as a result of the grant of options to research and development personnel under the 2021 Share Incentive\nPlan in the second half of 2021 and (ii) US$1.3 million increase in research and development technical service\nfees.\nOther Operating Income /(Expenses)\nWe incurred other operating expenses of US$2.0 million and generated other operating income of\nUS$14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. This change was primarily\nattributable to (i) US$16.0 million increase in net gain on disposal of cryptocurrencies for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, which is associated with Bitcoin price change prior to such disposal given we typically\nsell Bitcoins earned from our principal business lines within the next few days, (ii) US$3.7 million losses from\nchange in fair value of cryptocurrencies lent, (iii) US$2.9 million decrease in net loss on disposal of mining\nmachine at scrap value, as a result of fewer mining machines disposals in 2021 because the new mining\nmachines we purchased in 2021 were of more recent models and in a more stable condition and (iv) US$2.0\nmillion write-off of receivables from related parties for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to nil for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther Net Gain/(Loss)\nWe recorded other net gain of US$2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to other\nnet loss of US$2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to (i) the net\ngain on settlement of balances between Bitmain of US$4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) an impairment of property, plant and\n239 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nequipment of US$2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to nil for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, partially offset by the impairment loss of a pre-matured investment of US$2.0 million\nassociated with a forfeited investment project of US$2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, while\nwe did not conduct similar transaction or incur such cost for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProfit/(Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, we recorded a loss from operations of US$63.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and a profit from operations of US$130.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax Benefit/(Expenses)\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of US$8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and an\nincome tax expenses of US$48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily because we achieved\nprofit before taxation of US$130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to loss before\ntaxation of US$63.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Profit/(Loss)\nAs a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of US$55.8 million for the year ended December 31,\n2020 and a net profit of US$82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2020\nRevenue\nOur revenue increased by 110.0% from US$88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to\nUS$186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by revenue growth in two of our\nthree major business lines as follows.\nRevenue generated from proprietary mining increased by 136.2% from US$37.5 million for the year\nended December 31, 2019 to US$88.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly\nattributable to increase in our proprietary hash rate and the price appreciation of Bitcoin, the most\nsignificant type of cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, partially offset by decrease in\nthe number of Bitcoins mined, primarily resulting from the Bitcoin halving event on May 11, 2020. The\nhash rate allocated to proprietary mining, calculated on a twelve-month average basis, increased from\napproximately 0.5EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately 2.3EH/s for the year\nended December 31, 2020. The average price of Bitcoin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was\nUS$11,057.0 compared to US$7,358.3 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase\nof 50.3%, according to Frost & Sullivan.\nRevenue generated from Cloud Hash Rate increased by 80.0% from US$43.5 million for the year\nended December 31, 2019 to US$78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was\nprimarily driven by increase in our hash rate capacity, Bitcoin price appreciation and expansion of our\ncustomer base. The hash rate allocated to Cloud Hash Rate, calculated on a twelve-month average\nbasis, increased from approximately 0.8EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately\n2.1EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth in customer base was primarily driven by\nour increased brand recognition as a result of our expanding scale of operations as well as diverse\nhash rate subscription plans and high quality hash rate.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue increased by 112.0% from US$98.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to\nUS$209.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increase in (i) the depreciation of\nmining machines, (ii) electricity cost in operating mining machines and (iii) cost of mining machines sold for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation of mining machines increased by 147.6% from US$39.6 million for the year ended December\n31, 2019 to US$98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Electricity cost in operating\n240 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmining machines increased by 91.2% from US$37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$72.1\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of mining machines sold increased by 225.2% from US$5.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The\nincreases in both depreciation of mining machines and electricity cost in operating mining machines are\nprimarily attributable to the expansion of our hash rate capacity, calculated on a twelve-month average basis,\nfrom 51MW on average in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 136MW on average in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. The increase in cost of mining machines sold was primarily attributable to the increased\nsales of mining machines.\nSelling Expenses\nOur selling expenses increased by 77.5% from US$3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to\nUS$5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to (i) the one-off payroll expense to sales\npersonnel as a result of our separation from Bitmain in 2020 and (ii) the increase in promotional expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by 168.5% from US$7.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 to US$20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to one-off payroll\nexpense to administrative personnel as a result of our separation from Bitmain.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased by 106.3% from US$4.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 to US$9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to one-off payroll\nexpense as a result of our separation from Bitmain.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOur other operating expenses decreased by 66.1% from US$6.0 million for the year ended December 31,\n2019 to US$2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in net gain\non disposal of cryptocurrencies, which is associated with change of price of Bitcoin, the most significant\ntype of cryptocurrency involved in our business operation, prior to such disposal given we typically sell\nBitcoins earned from proprietary mining within the next few days.\nOther Net Gain/(Loss)\nWe recorded other net gain of US$0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other net loss of\nUS$2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily due to an increase in\nimpairment of property, plant and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020 as we decided to\ndiscontinue our construction of a mining datacenter in Washington, United States.\nLoss from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, we recorded loss from operations of US$31.3 million and US$63.4 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nOur income tax benefit increased from US$2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$8.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily because our loss before taxation increased from\nUS$30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to US$63.8 million for the year ended December 31,\n2020.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of US$27.9 million and US$55.8 million for the years\nended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n241 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our separation from Bitmain, we have financed our operations primarily with cash flow from\ndisposal of cryptocurrencies earned from principal business operations. Our net cash and cash equivalents\ndecreased from US$59.8 million as of December 31, 2019 to US$44.8 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily\nas a result of our active hash rate expansion in 2020. Our net cash and cash equivalents increased to\nUS$372.1 million as of December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to the increase in adjusted EBITDA, which is\na non-IFRS financial measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,\nfurther adjusted to exclude share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2. A reconciliation of profit/(loss), the\nmost comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted EBITDA is set forth in \u201c- Non-IFRS Financial Measure\u201d above.\nOur net cash and cash equivalents decreased to US$330.8 million as of June 30, 2022, primarily attributable to\nour active construction of mining datacenters in North America.\nTo date, we have not seen a material impact on our liquidity from events related to the COVID-19\npandemic. We believe that our cash, short-term investment and anticipated proceeds from disposal of\ncryptocurrencies in connection with our principal business will be sufficient to meet our current and\nanticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 18 months from the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus.\nOur material cash requirements as of June 30, 2022 and any subsequent interim period primarily include\nour purchase of plant, property and equipment, lease obligations, and borrowings. Other than those as\ndiscussed below, we did not have any significant capital and other commitments, long-term obligations or\nguarantees as of June 30, 2022.\nPurchase of property, plant and equipment. Purchase of property, plant and equipment primarily\nconsist of the purchase of machinery, equipments and other expenditure associated with mining datacenter\nconstruction and operations. The total cash outflow for the purchase of property, plant and equipment were\nUS$11.5 million, US$19.8 million, US$62.4 million and US$49.7 million for the years ended 2019, 2020 and 2021\nand the six months ended June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, we had commitments that are scheduled to be\npaid within 12 months for the construction of mining datacenters of approximately US$18.4 million.\nLease obligations.\u2007\u2007We occupy most of our office premises and certain mining datacenter under lease\narrangements, which generally have an initial lease term between one and a half to seven years. Lease\ncontracts are typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. Any extension options in\nthese leases have not been included in the lease liabilities unless we are reasonably certain to exercise the\nextension option. Periods after termination options are only included in the lease term if the lease is\nreasonably certain not to be terminated. The total cash outflow for leases, including the capital element of\nlease rentals paid and interests paid on leases for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 was approximately US$3.9 million, US$5.4 million, US$5.4 million and US$2.8\nmillion, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, lease liabilities mature based on contractual undiscounted\npayments within 12 months and over 12 months were US$5.8 million and US$72.8 million, respectively.\nBorrowings.\u2007\u2007Our borrowings as of June 30, 2022 represented a commitment of US$29.6 million relating\nto the principal amount and interests in connection with the issuance of the Bitdeer Convertible Note, a\nUS$30 million convertible note, on July 23, 2021, bearing an annual interest rate of 8%, which will mature on\nJuly 23, 2023.\nWe intend to fund our existing and future material cash requirements primarily with our cash, short-term\ninvestment and anticipated proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrencies in connection with our principal\nbusiness, which is classified as an investing activity. However, our future capital requirements will depend\non many factors, including market acceptance of cryptocurrency, our growth, our ability to scale up our\ninfrastructure and hash rate, our ability to effectively control costs, our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, expansion of sales and marketing activities\nand overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are\ninsufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional\nequity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders.\nThe incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing\nsuch debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. In the\nevent that additional\n242 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfinancing is required from outside sources, there is a possibility we may not be able to raise it on term\nacceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operations\nand financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment\nobligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our\nshares and classified as shareholder\u2019s equity or that are not reflected in our financial statements.\nFurthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated\nentity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable\ninterest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or\nengages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.\nOther than as discussed above, we did not have any significant capital and other commitments, long-\nterm obligations or guarantees as of June 30, 2022.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents our combined and consolidated statements of cash flows for the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021 and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended \nDecember 31,\nFor the Six Months Ended \nJune 30,\n2019 \n(Restated)\n2020 \n(Restated)\n2021 \n(Restated)\n2021 \n(Unaudited)\n(Restated)\n2022 \n(Unaudited)\nUS$\nUS$\nUS$\nUS$\nUS$\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(56,603)\n(109,176)\n(52,466)\n(681)\n(151,845)\nNet cash generated from / (used in) investing\nactivities\n(174,636)\n62,742\n394,569\n152,770\n114,884\nNet cash generated from / (used in) financing\nactivities\n226,412\n30,776\n(14,426)\n(16,467)\n(1,623)\nNet (decrease) / increase in cash and cash\nequivalents\n(4,827)\n(15,658)\n327,677\n135,622\n(38,584)\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning\nof the period\n65,286\n59,826\n44,753\n44,753\n372,088\nEffect of movements in exchange rates on\ncash and cash equivalents \nheld\n(633)\n585\n(342)\n(658)\n(2,734)\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the\nperiod\n59,826\n44,753\n372,088\n179,717\n330,770\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was US$151.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The\ndifference between our net loss of US$25.2 million and the net cash used in operating activities was primarily\nattributable to (i) adjustments for revenues recognized on acceptance of cryptocurrencies of US$156.6\nmillion, (ii) changes in prepayments and other assets of US$24.4 million primarily associated with deposits\nand prepayments made to suppliers following the expansion of our business during this period, (iii) changes\nin trade receivables of US$12.6 million primarily associated with the increase in revenue from our general\nhosting business, and (iv) income tax paid of US$19.6 million, partially offset by (i) an adjustment for share-\nbased payment expenses of US$54.4 million for the issuance of share awards following the adoption of the\n2021 Share Incentive Plan in July 2021, (ii) an adjustment for depreciation and amortization of US$29.3 million\nprimarily relating to the depreciation of mining machines used in our principal business operations and\nproperty, plant and equipment used in connection with the expansion of our mining datacenters during this\nperiod, and (iii) an adjustment for income tax expenses of US$8.0 million.\n243 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNet cash used in operating activities was US$0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The\ndifference between our net profit of US$113.8 million and the net cash used in operating activities was\nprimarily attributable to (i) adjustments for the revenue recognized on acceptance of cryptocurrencies of\nUS$178.0 million, (ii) an adjustment for gain on disposal of cryptocurrencies of US$16.4 million and (iii)\nchanges in prepayments and other assets of US$12.4 million primarily associated with prepayments made to\nsuppliers following the expansion of our business during this period, partially offset by (i) an adjustment for\ndepreciation and amortization of US$43.3 million primarily relating to the depreciation of mining machines\nused in our principal business operations and property, plant and equipment used in connection with the\nexpansion of our mining datacenters during this period and (ii) an adjustment for income tax expenses of\nUS$26.6 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was US$52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Market risk represents the risk of\nloss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our\nfinancial risk exposure is primarily the result of cryptocurrency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk, credit\nrisk and liquidity risk.\nCryptocurrency Risk\nWe are exposed to cryptocurrency risk as we yield cryptocurrencies from certain revenue arrangements.\nWe recognize revenue based on the spot fair value of cryptocurrencies on the day they are earned, but the\nvalue of the cryptocurrencies is subject to change on the date they are disposed for fiat currency.\nCryptocurrency prices are affected by various forces including global supply and demand, interest\nrates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation and the global political and economic conditions. Our profitability\nis highly correlated to the current and future market price of cryptocurrencies and a decline in the market\nprices for cryptocurrencies could negatively impact our future operations. In addition, we may not be able to\nliquidate our holdings of cryptocurrencies at our desired price if required, or, in extreme market conditions,\nwe may not be able to liquidate our holdings of cryptocurrencies at all.\nCryptocurrencies have a limited history and the fair value historically has been very volatile. Historical\nperformance of cryptocurrencies is not indicative of their future price performance. Our cryptocurrencies\ncurrently primarily consist of Bitcoin. We currently do not use any derivative contracts to hedge its exposure\nto cryptocurrency risk, but management closely monitors the impact of the mainstream cryptocurrency\nexchange market on the change of exchange rates from cryptocurrency to fiat currency. We limit our exposure\nto the cryptocurrency risk by including in its operation strategy to dispose the cryptocurrencies for fiat\ncurrency shortly after they are earned.\nFluctuations in the market price of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies may have a more linear and\nquantifiable impact on some of our businesses than others. A 10% increase or decrease in the average market\nprice of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies over 2019, 2020, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022,\n245 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwithout considering other factors, would have had the following impact on our revenue: (i) an increase or\ndecrease in our revenue from proprietary mining by 10%\u037e (ii) an increase or decrease in our revenue from\nCloud Hash Rate in general, as the price of Bitcoin is a key factor in determining the hash rate subscription\nfee, provided however, the precise impact is subject to other factors, such as the expected mining rewards at\nthe time of subscription, contract terms, allocation of hash rate between classic and accelerator mode, and\nelectricity price\u037e and (iii) an increase or decrease in revenue from Cloud Hosting, provided that the overall\nimpact is less linear as compared to in the case of proprietary mining. The impact on the revenue from sales\nof mining machines depends on market sentiments towards Bitcoin at the relevant point in time, in addition\nto the actual price of Bitcoin. A change in the market price of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies would\nnot have had a material effect on our revenue from other sources.\nIn addition, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies accounted for 0.3%, 1.1%, 1.0% and 0.5% of our total\nassets as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021, and June 30, 2022, respectively. Since\nwe dispose cryptocurrencies in a relatively short period of time, a 10% increase or decrease in the market\nprice of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021\nand June 30, 2022, respectively, would not have had a material effect on our total assets at these dates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest rate risk is primarily attributable to bank deposits, restricted cash and borrowings. Bank\ndeposits, restricted cash and borrowings at variable rates and at fixed rates expose us to cash flow interest\nrate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively. Management closely monitors the fluctuation of such\nrates periodically. If the interest rates had been higher or lower by 1% with all other variables including tax\nrate being held constant, the profit/(loss) before tax would have been higher or lower by US$0.6 million,\nUS$0.5 million, US$3.5 million and US$3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.\nInvestment Risk\nWe are exposed to investment risk from investment transactions such as the purchase of\ncryptocurrency- denoted wealth management products. These investments are not principal-guaranteed, and\nwe may suffer material loss from such investments. We monitor our investments closely and limit our\nexposure to the investment risk by including in our operation strategy the requirements to invest only in\nrobust wealth management products and the investments need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk as we conduct transactions which give rise to payables and\ncash balances that are denominated in foreign currencies and the fair value or future cash flows of our\nfinancial instrument may fluctuate due to movement in foreign exchange rates of these foreign currencies.\nThe volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we are not able to accurately forecast. Our\nmanagement is closely monitoring our exposure to currency risk and seeks to minimize its exposure to such\nrisk. We were not exposed to material foreign currency risk during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020\nand 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a\nfinancial loss to us. Credit risk arises mainly from cash deposited in the banks and cryptocurrencies\ndeposited in custody, cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management\nproduct purchases.\nTo manage risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, we only transact with reputable\nfinancial institutions, which have no recent history of default. As such, we are not subject to material credit\nrisk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.\nSubstantially all of our cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets held in the custody by Matrix Finance and\nTechnologies Holding Company (\u201cMatrixport Group\u201d), a related party. To limit exposure to credit risk\n246 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrelating to cryptocurrencies under custody, we evaluate the system security design of the custody service\nprovider and regularly reviews the exposure of cryptocurrencies held in custody. We have further\nimplemented internal controls to ensure the appropriate access to the cryptocurrencies under custody and\nadopted the operating strategy of disposing of the cryptocurrency for fiat currency shortly after they are\nearned. We expect that there is no significant credit risk from non-performance by Matrixport Group.\nHowever, Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future be,\nsubject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A security breach or cyberattack\ncould result in a partial or total loss of our cryptocurrencies and such a loss could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also have credit exposure to cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-denoted\nwealth management product purchases. We assess such credit risk both at contract inception and each\nquarter or in shorter interval by considering the past collection experience and any indications that the\ncorresponding amount may not be fully collected. To manage such exposure, we continuously monitor the\nrelevant factors, such as the liquidity of the underlying cryptocurrencies, negative report related to the\ncounterparty, and only transact with creditworthy counterparties and include in our operation strategy that\nthe lending needs to be collected, and the wealth management products need to be redeemed within the same\nfiscal quarter. Currently, we only conduct such transactions with the Matrixport Group. We had never\nexperienced credit losses and have no existing exposures to such credit risk as of the date of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Consequently, credit exposure to these transactions is not considered material.\nLiquidity Risk\nOur liquidity risk is minimal. We currently have sufficient reserve of cash. We recorded US$330.7 million\ncash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022, and our net cash used in operating activities during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 were US$151.8 million. We believe that our cash, short-term investment and\nanticipated proceeds from disposal of cryptocurrencies in connection with our principal business will be\nsufficient to meet our current and anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at\nleast the next 18 months from the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. We manage our liquidity risk by\nmonitoring cash flow generated from operations, available borrowing capacity, and by managing the maturity\nprofiles of our long-term loans. We expect to continue our low-leverage strategy and plan to lower our\nliquidity risk by expanding our capital expenditure-light businesses such as Hash Rate Marketplace.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe adopted the following recently issued or amended standards in the period between January 1, 2022\nand June 30, 2022. These new standards are not expected to have any significant impact on our financial\nstatements:\nStandard/Interpretation\nApplication \nDate of \nStandard\nApplication \nDate for the \nGroup\nAmendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16, Interest\nRate Benchmark Reform\u202f-\u202fPhase 2\nJanuary 1, 2021\nJanuary 1, 2021\nAmendment to IFRS 16, Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond\nJune 30, 2021\nApril 1, 2021\nApril 1, 2021\nAmendments to IFRS 1, Subsidiary as a First-time Adopter\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2022\nAmendments to IFRS 9, Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2022\nAmendments to IFRS 3, Reference to the Conceptual Framework\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2022\nAmendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds\nbefore Intended Use\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2022\nAmendments to IAS 37, Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a\nContract\nJanuary 1, 2022\nJanuary 1, 2022\nUp to the date of issue of these financial statements, the IASB has issued a number of amendments and\na new standard, IFRS 17, Insurance contracts, which are not yet effective as of June 30, 2022 and have not\nbeen adopted in these financial statements. We are in the process of making an assessment of what the\nimpact of these new and amended standards and interpretations would be in the period of initial application.\nSo far it has concluded that the adoption of them is unlikely to have a significant impact on our financial\nposition.\n247 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStandard/Interpretation\nApplication \nDate for the \nGroup\nIFRS 17, Insurance Contracts and Amendments to Address Concerns and Implementation\nChallenges\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAmendments to IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and\nDisclosure of Accounting Policies\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAmendments to IAS 1, Making Materiality Judgement\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2, Disclosure of Accounting \nPolicies\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAmendments to IAS 8, Definition of Accounting Estimates\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAmendments to IAS 12, Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single\nTransaction\nJanuary 1, 2023\nInitial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\u202f-\u202fComparative Information\nJanuary 1, 2023\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe prepare our combined and consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019,\n2020 and 2021 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d).

Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on\nhistorical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The\nresulting accounting estimates may not be equal to the related actual results.\nWe believe the accounting policies related to the depreciation of mining machines, cryptocurrency\naccounting, revenue from the proprietary mining business, income taxes and share-based payments for the\nyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 involve significant\njudgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and interim financial\ninformation. Our use of judgements and estimates is disclosed in the Note 3 and the related accounting\npolicies are disclosed in Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in\nthis proxy statement/\u200bprospectus. When reviewing our financial statements and interim financial information,\nyou should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, our significant judgments and other\nuncertainties affecting our applications of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes of\nsuch policies, judgments and uncertainties. You should read the descriptions of these significant judgments\nand estimates in conjunction with other disclosures included in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of\nreduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS\nAct exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial\naccounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. The JOBS Act\nalso exempts us from having to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting\nunder Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b).\nHolding Company Structure\nBitdeer Technologies Holding Company is a limited liability company incorporated in the Cayman\nIslands on November 18, 2020 with no material operations of its own. We currently conduct our operations\nprimarily through our subsidiaries. As a result, Bitdeer\u2019s ability to pay dividends primarily depends upon\ndividends paid by our subsidiaries. If our existing subsidiaries or any newly formed ones incur debt on their\nown behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to\nus.\n248 \n",

Specifically, the audit\ncommittee is responsible for keeping and updating a list of related persons and the principals of different\ndepartments are responsible for identifying and monitoring related party transactions. The policy details the\nauthority of the board of directors and shareholders to review and approve different related party\ntransactions. For any related person transaction with a transactional value no less than US$5 million and\naccounting for more than 1% of the total audited assets or market value of the most recent audited period,\nthe same committee shall review and submit a written report to the board of directors for review and the\ntransaction shall be approved in shareholding meetings. Directors are required to disclose interests in the\nrelated party transaction and only disinterested directors can vote for a related person transaction in a board\nmeeting. The price terms of all related party transactions shall be fair, taking into account prices in the\ncomparable independent third-party market, price terms of non-related party transactions, and relevant cost\nand revenue. In addition, no loan shall be made to the Company\u2019s directors, officers or supervisors directly\nor indirectly.\nRelated Person Transaction Policy of BSGA\nBSGA has adopted a code of ethics requiring it to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests,\nexcept under guidelines or resolutions approved by BSGA Board (or the appropriate committee of BSGA\nBoard) or as disclosed in its public filings with the SEC. Under its code of ethics, conflict of interest\nsituations includes any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or\nguarantee of indebtedness) involving the company.\nIn addition, BSGA audit committee, pursuant to a written charter that it adopted, is responsible for\nreviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that it enters into such transactions. An\naffirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum\nis present is required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire\naudit committee constitutes a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the\nmembers of the audit committee is required to approve a related party transaction. BSGA also requires each\ndirector and executive officer to complete a directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 questionnaire that elicits information\nabout related party transactions.\nThese procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the\nindependence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.\n255 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, BSGA has agreed not to consummate an initial business\ncombination with an entity that is affiliated with any of BSGA\u2019s Sponsor, officers or directors unless BSGA,\nor a committee of independent directors, has obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking\nfirm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company BSGA is\nseeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm, that the initial business combination is fair to BSGA\nfrom a financial point of view. Furthermore, no finder\u2019s fees, reimbursements or cash payments will be made\nto BSGA Sponsor, officers or directors, or BSGA\u2019s or their affiliates, for services rendered to BSGA prior to or\nin connection with the completion of BSGA\u2019s initial business combination. However, the following payments\nwill be made to BSGA\u2019s Sponsor, officers or directors, or BSGA\u2019s or their affiliates:\nRepayment of up to an aggregate of up to US$200,000 in loans made to BSGA by its Sponsor to cover\noffering-related and organizational expenses\u037e\nPayment to an affiliate of BSGA\u2019s Sponsor of US$10,000 per month, for up to 12 months (or up to 18\nmonths from the closing of this offering if BSGA extend the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination by the full amount of time), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative\nsupport\u037e\nReimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing\nan initial business combination\u037e and\nRepayment of loans which may be made by BSGA\u2019s Sponsor or an affiliate of BSGA\u2019s Sponsor or\ncertain of BSGA\u2019s officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended\ninitial business combination, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written\nagreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to US$1,150,000 of such loans may be convertible\ninto units, at a price of US$10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.\nBSGA\u2019s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to BSGA Sponsor,\nofficers or directors, or BSGA\u2019s or their affiliates.\nRelated Person Transaction Policy of BTG upon Consummation of the Business Combination\nEffective upon the consummation of the Business Combination, BTG expects to adopt a related person\ntransaction policy that sets forth its procedures for the identification, review, consideration and approval or\nratification of related person transactions. The policy will become effective upon the consummation of the\nBusiness Combination. For purposes of BTG\u2019s policy only, a related person transaction is a transaction,\narrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which\nBTG and any related person are, were or will be participants in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser\nof US$120,000 or one percent of the average of the company\u2019s total assets at year end for the last two\ncompleted fiscal years. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to BTG as an employee\nor director are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director or beneficial\nowner of more than 5% of any class of BTG\u2019s voting securities and any of their respective immediate family\nmembers and any entity owned or controlled by such persons.\nUnder the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any\ntransaction that was not a related person transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that\nwas not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to consummation, BTG\u2019s management must\npresent information regarding the related person transaction to BTG\u2019s audit committee, or, if audit committee\napproval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of BTG\u2019s Board of Directors, for review,\nconsideration and approval or ratification. The presentation must include a description of, among other\nthings, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related persons, the benefits to BTG of the\ntransaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as\nthe case may be, an unrelated third party or to or from employees generally. Under the policy, BTG will\ncollect information that BTG deems reasonably necessary from each director, executive officer and, to the\nextent feasible, significant shareholder to enable BTG to identify any existing or potential related-person\ntransactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under BTG\u2019s Code of Conduct that BTG\nexpects to adopt prior to the closing of this Business Combination, BTG\u2019s employees and directors will have\nan affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to\ngive rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related person transactions, BTG\u2019s audit committee, or other\n256 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nindependent body of BTG\u2019s Board of Directors, will take into account the relevant available facts and\ncircumstances including, but not limited to:\nthe risks, costs and benefits to BTG\u037e\nthe impact on a director\u2019s independence in the event that the related person is a director, immediate\nfamily member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated\u037e\nthe availability of other sources for comparable services or products\u037e and\nthe terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees\ngenerally.\nThe policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction,\nBTG\u2019s audit committee, or other independent body of BTG\u2019s Board of Directors, must consider, in light of\nknown circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, BTG\u2019s best interests and\nthose of BTG\u2019s shareholders, as BTG\u2019s audit committee, or other independent body of BTG\u2019s Board of\nDirectors, determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.\n257 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nCOMPARISON OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS\nThis section describes the material differences between the rights of BSGA Shareholders before the\nconsummation of the Business Combination, and the rights of BTG shareholders after the Business\nCombination. These differences in shareholder rights result from the differences between the respective\ngoverning documents of BSGA and BTG.\nThis section does not include a complete description of all differences among such rights, nor does it\ninclude a complete description of such rights. Furthermore, the identification of some of the differences of\nthese rights as material is not intended to indicate that other differences that may be equally important do\nnot exist.

The Directors may at any time declare a Share to be wholly or in part exempt from\nthe provisions of this Article. The Company\u2019s lien on a Share extends to any amount payable in respect\nof it, including but not limited to dividends.\nThe Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors in their absolute discretion think fit, any Share\non which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless an amount in respect of which the\nlien exists is presently payable nor until the expiration of fourteen calendar days after a notice in\nwriting, demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is\npresently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the Share, or the\nPersons entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.\nFor giving effect to any such sale the Directors may authorize a Person to transfer the Shares sold to\nthe purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the Shares comprised in any\nsuch transfer and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his\ntitle to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the\nsale.\nThe proceeds of the sale after deduction of expenses, fees and commissions incurred by the Company\nshall be received by the Company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of\nwhich the lien exists as is presently payable, and the residue shall (subject to a like lien for sums not\npresently payable as existed upon the Shares prior to the sale) be paid to the Person entitled to the\nShares immediately prior to the sale.\nCALLS ON SHARES\nSubject to the terms of the allotment, the Directors may from time to time make calls upon the\nShareholders in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares, and each Shareholder shall (subject to\nreceiving at least fourteen calendar days\u2019 notice specifying the time or times of payment) pay to the\nCompany at the time or times so specified the amount called on such Shares.

No such sum paid in advance of calls shall entitle the Member paying such sum to any\nportion\nB-11 \n36. \n37. \n38. \n39. \n40. \n41. \n42. \n43. \n44. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof a dividend declared in respect of any period prior to the date upon which such sum would, but for\nsuch payment, become presently payable.\nFORFEITURE OF SHARES\nIf a Shareholder fails to pay any call or instalment of a call in respect of partly paid Shares on the day\nappointed for payment, the Directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of such\ncall or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or\ninstalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.\nThe notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of fourteen calendar days from the\ndate of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state\nthat in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the Shares in respect of which the call\nwas made will be liable to be forfeited.\nIf the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any Share in respect of\nwhich the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by notice has\nbeen made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect.\nA forfeited Share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the\nDirectors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such\nterms as the Directors think fit.\nA Person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Shareholder in respect of the forfeited\nShares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of\nforfeiture were payable by him to the Company in respect of the Shares forfeited, but his liability shall\ncease if and when the Company receives payment in full of the amount unpaid on the Shares forfeited.\nA certificate in writing under the hand of a Director that a Share has been duly forfeited on a date\nstated in the certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the facts in the declaration as against all\nPersons claiming to be entitled to the Share.\nThe Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for a Share on any sale or disposition\nthereof pursuant to the provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture and may execute a transfer of the\nShare in favor of the Person to whom the Share is sold or disposed of and that Person shall be\nregistered as the holder of the Share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase\nmoney, if any, nor shall his title to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the\nproceedings in reference to the disposition or sale.\nThe provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum\nwhich by the terms of issue of a Share becomes due and payable, whether on account of the amount of\nthe Share, or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and\nnotified.\nTRANSFER OF SHARES\nThe instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in writing and in any usual or common form or such\nother form as the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, approve and be executed by or on behalf\nof the transferor and if in respect of a nil or partly paid up Share, or if so required by the Directors,\nshall also be executed on behalf of the transferee and shall be accompanied by the certificate (if any) of\nthe Shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show\nthe right of the transferor to make the transfer.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nNote 1 - Organization and Business Operation\nBlue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated as a\nBritish Virgin Island (\u201cBVI\u201d) business company on February 23, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the\npurpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar\nbusiness combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company has not\nselected any potential Business Combination target and the Company has not, nor has anyone on its behalf,\ninitiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential Business Combination target.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period\nfrom February 23, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company\u2019s formation, the Initial\nPublic Offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d), searching for a Business Combination target and the negotiation of the Merger\nAgreement as described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the\ncompletion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating\nincome in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO.\nThe Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\nThe Company\u2019s Sponsor is BSG First Euro Investment Corp., a British Virgin Islands company (the\n\u201cSponsor\u201d).\nThe registration statement for the Company\u2019s IPO was declared effective on June 9, 2021 (the \u201cEffective\nDate\u201d). On June 14, 2021 the Company consummated the IPO of 5,750,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d), including\n750,000 Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional units to\ncover the over-allotment (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units\nbeing offered, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000, which is\ndiscussed in Note 3.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 292,500 units,\nincluding 22,500 units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional\nunits to cover the over-allotment (the \u201cPrivate Placement Unit\u201d), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement\nUnit, generating gross proceeds of $2,925,000, which is discussed in Note 4.\nTransaction costs of the IPO amounted to $4,158,799 consisting of $1,150,000 of underwriting discount,\n$2,012,500 of deferred underwriting discount, the fair value of the representative shares of $478,857 and\n$517,442 of other offering costs.\nUpon the closing of the IPO, an aggregate of $10.10 per Unit sold in the IPO, or an aggregate of\n$58,075,000, was held in a Trust Account (\u201cTrust Account\u201d) and was invested only in U.S. government\ntreasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under\nRule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury\nobligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be\nreleased to the Company to pay its taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering and the\nprivate placement will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the\ninitial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a\nshareholder vote to amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to\n(A) modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the\nCompany does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with\nrespect to any other provision relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-Business Combination activity and (iii)\nthe redemption of all of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business\nCombination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust\nAccount could become subject to the claims of the creditors, if any, which could have priority over the\nclaims of the public shareholders.\nThe Company will provide the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of\ntheir public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a\nshareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The\ndecision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or\nconduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of\nfactors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the\nCompany to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. The Company\nF-7 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nwill provide the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares\nupon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the\naggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation\nof the initial Business Combination, including interest, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, divided\nby the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.\nThe ordinary shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as\ntemporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480 \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from\nEquity.\u201d In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net\ntangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the\nCompany seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in\nfavor of the Business Combination.\nOn December 5, 2022, the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting. At this meeting, the\nshareholders of the Company approved the proposal to amend and restate (the \u201cCharter Amendment\u201d) the\nCompany\u2019s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the \u201cCharter\u201d) to, among other\nthings, extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination (the \u201cExtension\u201d)\nup to four (4) times for an additional three months each time from December 14, 2022 (the \u201cCurrent\nTermination Date\u201d) to December 14, 2023 (the termination date as so extended, the \u201cExtended Termination\nDate\u201d) by deleting the Charter in its entirety and substitute it with the second amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association (the \u201cAmended Charter\u201d).\nPursuant to the terms of the Amended Charter, the Company has until 18 months from the closing of the\nIPO to consummate a Business Combination, provided however that if the board of directors anticipates that\nthe Company may not be able to consummate a Business Combination within 18 months of the closing of the\nIPO, the Company may, by resolution of directors, at the request of the initial shareholders, extend the period\nof time to consummate a Business Combination up to four times, each by an additional three months (for a\ntotal of up to 30 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the initial shareholders depositing\nadditional funds into the Trust Account in accordance with terms as set out in the Trust Agreement\n(\u201cCombination Period\u201d). In the event that the Company does not consummate a Business Combination\nwithin 18 months from the closing of the IPO or within up to 30 months from the closing of the IPO (subject\nin the latter case to valid three months extensions having been made in each case), such failure shall trigger\nan automatic redemption of the Public Shares (an Automatic Redemption Event) and the Directors of the\nCompany shall take all such action necessary (i) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten\n(10) Business Days thereafter to redeem the Public Shares in cash at a per-share amount equal to the\napplicable Per-Share Redemption Price\u037e and (ii) as promptly as practicable, to cease all operations except for\nthe purpose of making such distribution and any subsequent winding up of the Company\u2019s affairs. In the\nevent of an Automatic Redemption Event, only the holders of Public Shares shall be entitled to receive pro\nrata redeeming distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Public Shares. In order to extend\nthe time available for the Company to consummate the initial business combination, the Company must\ndeposit $0.15 for each public Class A ordinary share that has not been redeemed into the trust account for\neach three-month extension.\nIn connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment, the holders of 4,031,612 Class A\nordinary shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption\nprice of approximately $10.41505502 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $41.99\nmillion.\nOn June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited\ninto the Company\u2019s trust account $1,150,000 (representing $0.10 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the\nCombination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a\ndeposit of $257,758.20 to the trust account and extended the date by which the Company has to complete a\nbusiness combination from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023.\nThe Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to\ntheir founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination\nand (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder\nF-8 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshares if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period\n(although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public\nshares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination\nPeriod). If the Company submits the initial Business Combination to the public shareholders for a vote, the\ninsiders have agreed, pursuant to such letter agreement, to vote their founder shares, private placement\nshares and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of the initial Business Combination.\nThe Company\u2019s Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims\nby a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with\nwhich the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the\nTrust Account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust\naccount as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust\nassets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a\nthird party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to\nany claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be\nunenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such\nthird -party claims. The Company has not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to\nsatisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of the Company.\nThe Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such obligations.\nMerger\nOn November 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger\nAgreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company incorporated with\nlimited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company\n(\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company incorporated with\nlimited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (\u201cBitdeer\u201d).\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a Business Combination\ntransaction by which Merger Sub will merge with and into Bitdeer with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and\nbecoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d and, together with the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the \u201cTransactions\u201d). The Merger Agreement and the\nTransactions were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, Merger Sub\nand Bitdeer.\nOn December 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of\nMerger (as amended from time to time, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Bitdeer\nTechnologies Group, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands (\u201cBTG\u201d), (iii) Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cMerger Sub 1\u201d), (iv) Blue Safari Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands\nbusiness company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cMerger Sub 2\u201d), (v) Bitdeer Merge Limited, an\nexempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of BTG (\u201cMerger Sub 3\u201d, and together with BTG, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the\n\u201cAcquisition Entities\u201d), (vi) Merger Sub, and (vii) Bitdeer, to amend and restate the Original Merger\nAgreement.\nThe Merger Agreement amended and restated the Original Merger Agreement to effect a change in\nstructure of the business combination without affecting any underlying economic interests, whereby (a)\nMerger Sub 1 will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the \u201cFirst\nSPAC Merger\u201d) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG, (b) immediately following the First SPAC\nMerger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity\n(the \u201cSecond SPAC Merger\u201d, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the \u201cInitial Mergers\u201d), and (c)\nfollowing the Initial Mergers, Merger Sub 3 will merge with and into Bitdeer (the \u201cAcquisition Merger\u201d and\ntogether with the Initial Mergers, the \u201cMergers\u201d), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a\nwholly owned subsidiary of BTG. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein were\nunanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub\n2, Merger Sub 3, and Bitdeer.\nF-9 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are expected to be\nconsummated after obtaining the required approval by the shareholders of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1,\nMerger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and Bitdeer and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing\nconditions.\nOn May 30, 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement\nand Plan of Merger (the \u201cAmendment\u201d, and the Original Merger Agreement as amended by such\nAmendment, the \u201cAmended Merger Agreement\u201d) with BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3,\nMerger Sub and Bitdeer, to amend the Original Merger Agreement. The Amendment extends the termination\ndate upon which either the Company or Bitdeer may terminate the Amended Merger Agreement, from May\n31, 2022 to September 1, 2022.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Amendment, Bitdeer will provide certain interest-free loans with an\naggregate principal amount of US$1,993,000 to the Company to fund any amount that may be required in\norder to extend the period of time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination and for\nthe Company\u2019s working capital. Such loans will only become repayable upon the Closing of the Business\nCombination.\nOn December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Amended and Restated\nAgreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d, and the First Amended Merger Agreement as\namended by such Second Amendment, the \u201cSecond Amended Merger Agreement\u201d) with BTG, Merger Sub 1,\nMerger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Merger Sub and Bitdeer, to amend the First Amended Merger Agreement. The\nSecond Amendment extends the termination date upon which either the Company or Bitdeer may terminate\nthe Second Amended Merger Agreement, from September 1, 2022 to the earlier of (i) June 1, 2023 and (ii) the\nthen applicable deadline for the Company to complete a Business Combination in accordance with its\norganizational documents. In addition, pursuant to the Second Amendment, Bitdeer has agreed to provide\ncertain interest-free loans with an aggregate principal amount of $2,584,141 to the Company to fund any\namount that may be required in order to further extend the period of time available for the Company to\nconsummate a Business Combination and for its working capital. Such loans will only become repayable\nupon the Acquisition Closing (as defined in the Second Amended Merger Agreement). As of December 31,\n2022, the Company received $2,545,800 from Bitdeer.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $487,303 in cash, and working capital deficit of $6,602,257.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO were satisfied through the\nproceeds of $25,000 from the sale of the Founders Shares (as defined in Note 5), and loan proceeds from the\nSponsor of $200,000 under the Note (Note 5).\nSubsequent from the consummation of the IPO, the Company\u2019s liquidity has been satisfied through the\nnet proceeds from the consummation of the IPO, the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account\nand the loan from Bitdeer.\nThe Company expects to incur increased expenses since becoming a public company (for legal, financial\nreporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses in connection with the initial Business\nCombination.\nOn June 1, 2022 and September 6, 2022, using the loan amount received to date, the Company deposited\ninto the Company\u2019s trust account $1,150,000 (representing $0.20 per Class A ordinary share) to extend the\nCombination Period from June 14, 2022 to December 14, 2022. On December 5, 2022, the Company made a\ndeposit of $257,758.20 (representing $0.15 per Class A ordinary share) to the trust account and extended the\ndate by which the Company has to complete a business combination from December 14, 2022 to March 14,\n2023. It is uncertain that the Company will be able consummate a Business Combination by this date. If a\nBusiness Combination is not consummated by the required date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and\nsubsequent dissolution. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in\naccordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting\nStandards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-15, \u201cDisclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a\nGoing Concern\u201d, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, and subsequent dissolution,\nF-10 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshould the Company be unable to complete a business combination, raises substantial doubt about the\nCompany\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this\ndate, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. No adjustments have been made to\nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after March 14,\n2023.\nBased upon the above analysis, management determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt\nabout the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated\nfinancial statements are issued.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while\nit is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial position,\nresults of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as\nof the date of these consolidated financial statements. In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus\ncommenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations,\nincluding the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus.\nFurther, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the\ndate of these consolidated financial statements and the specific impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these consolidated\nfinancial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result\nfrom the outcome of these uncertainties.\nAdditionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation\nand Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company\u2019s ability to consummate\na Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately\nconsummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company\u2019s\nability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing\nwhich may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased\nmarket liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The\nimpact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet\ndeterminable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from\nthe outcome of this uncertainty.\nNote 2\u202f-\u202fSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the SEC.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nwholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as\nmodified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and it may take advantage of\ncertain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are\nnot emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding\nexecutive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements\nF-11 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden\nparachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to\ncomply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have\nnot had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities\nregistered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting\nstandards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and\ncomply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out\nis irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that\nwhen a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,\nthe Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private\ncompanies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an\nemerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or\nimpossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported\namounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less\nwhen purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company has $487,303 and $413,417 in cash and cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOffering Costs Associated with IPO\nThe Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting\nBulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) Topic 5A\u202f-\u202f\u201cExpenses of Offering\u201d. Offering costs consist principally of professional and\nregistration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO and were charged to\nshareholders\u2019 equity upon the completion of the IPO. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, offering costs in\nthe aggregate of $4,158,799 have been charged to shareholders\u2019 equity (consisting of $1,150,000 of\nunderwriting discount, $2,012,500 of deferred underwriting discount, the fair value of the representative\nshares of $478,857 and $517,442 of other offering costs).\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under\nFASB ASC 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\u201d approximates the carrying amounts represented\nin the balance sheet, primarily due to its short-term nature.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a\nliability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP stablishes a\nthree-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives\nthe highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1\nmeasurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in\nactive markets\u037e\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or\nindirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices\nfor identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active\u037e and\nF-12 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an\nentity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. In some\ncircumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of\nthe fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in\nthe fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nInvestments Held in Trust Account\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $18,237,834 and $58,077,104 assets held in the Trust\nAccount, which primarily consist of investments in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities,\ncash, or a combination thereof. The Company\u2019s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as\ntrading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each\nreporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in\ngain on Investments Held in Trust Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair\nvalues of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information and\nclassifies as Level 1 measurements.\nClass A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance\nwith the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480 \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from\nEquity.\u201d Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is\nmeasured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features\nredemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the\noccurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company\u2019s control) is classified as temporary equity. At\nall other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders\u2019 equity. The Company\u2019s Class A ordinary\nshares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company\u2019s control and\nsubject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 1,718,388\nand 5,750,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption\nvalue as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders\u2019 deficit section of the Company\u2019s balance sheets.\nNet loss Per Ordinary Share\nThe Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B\nordinary shares. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. The table below\npresents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net loss per\nshare for each class of ordinary shares:\nFor the year ended December 31, \n2022\nFor the period from February 23, 2021 \n(Inception) to December 31, 2021\nRedeemable\nClass A\nNon- \nredeemable\nClass A\nClass B\nRedeemable\nClass A\nNon- \nredeemable\nClass A\nClass B\nNUMERATOR\nAllocation of loss\n$(2,988,703\n$ (181,921\n$ (747,176\n$ (862,273\n$\n(52,486\n$ (324,961\nDENOMINATOR\nWeighted average shares\noutstanding\n5,750,000\n350,000\n1,437,500\n3,704,327\n225,481\n1,396,034\nBasic and diluted net loss\nper share\n$\n(0.52\n$\n(0.52\n$\n(0.52\n$\n(0.23\n$\n(0.23\n$\n(0.23\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC\n740, \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of\nF-13 \n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured\nusing enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax\nrates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are\nestablished, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the consolidated\nfinancial statements recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax\nreturn. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination by taxing authorities. The Company\u2019s management determined that the British Virgin Islands is\nthe Company\u2019s major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no\nunrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not\naware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation\nfrom its position. The Company\u2019s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\nThe Company is considered to be a British Virgin Islands business company with no connection to any\nother taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the\nBritish Virgin Islands or the United States. As such, the Company\u2019s tax provision was zero for the period\npresented.\nConcentration of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a\ncash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage\nof $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the\nCompany is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting\npronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNote 3\u202f-\u202fInitial Public Offering\nOn June 14, 2021, Company consummated its IPO and sold 5,750,000 Units, including 750,000 Units sold\npursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional units to cover the over-\nallotment. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (\u201cOrdinary Share\u201d) and one right (\u201cRight\u201d) to receive\none-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were\nsold at a price of $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds to the Company of $57,500,000.\nAll of the 5,750,000 Class A ordinary share sold as part of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption\nfeature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with the Company\u2019s liquidation,\nif there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection\nwith certain amendments to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its\nstaff\u2019s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption\nprovisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be\nclassified outside of permanent equity.\nThe Class A ordinary share is subject to SEC and its staff\u2019s guidance on redeemable equity instruments,\nwhich has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become\nredeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period\nfrom the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become\nredeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the\nredemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the\nredemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value\nimmediately as they occur. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, the Company recognized the accretion\nF-14 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfrom initial book value to redemption amount value.

As the sale of mining machines represents contracts with\ncustomers in the Group\u2019s ordinary course of business, the transactions should have been accounted for\nunder IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue from the sale of mining machines should\nhave been recognized at the amount of promised consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled,\nand the cost of revenue should have been recognized at the net book value of the mining machines sold, as\ndiscussed in detail in the Note 2(p) to the Annual Financial Statements. The previously reported condensed\ncombined and consolidated financial statement for the six months ended June 30, 2021 is restated to correct\nthe above error.\nThe effects of the above adjustment on the condensed combined and consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income and cash flows, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, are presented\nbelow.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nIn preparing the Interim Financial Information, management has made judgements and estimates that\naffect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, profit and\nloss. Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other\nfactors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates\nmay not be equal to the related actual results. The significant judgement made by management in applying\nthe Group\u2019s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those described\nin the Annual Financial Statements.\n5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFinancial risk factors\nThe Group is exposed to various market risks including cryptocurrency risk, interest rate risk,\ninvestment risk and foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk and liquidity risk associated with financial\nassets and liabilities. The Group has designed and implemented various risk management strategies, which\nare the same as those discussed in the Annual Financial Statements, to ensure the exposure to these risks is\nconsistent with its risk tolerance and business objectives.\nF-26 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLiquidity risk\nThe following is the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s financial liabilities based on contractual\nundiscounted payments:\nAt December 31, 2021\nIn thousands of USD\nWithin \n1 year or on \ndemand\nMore\nthan \n1 year but\nless than \n2 years\nMore than\n2 years\nbut \nless than \n5 years\nMore\nthan \n5 years\nTotal\nCarrying \namount at \nDecember\n31\nTrade payables\n17,740\n-\n-\n-\n17,740\n17,740\nOther payables and accruals\n17,258\n-\n-\n-\n17,258\n17,258\nAmounts due to related party\n19\n-\n-\n-\n19\n19\nBorrowings\n-\n29,460\n-\n-\n29,460\n29,460\nLease liabilities\n5,489\n5,516\n16,275\n53,254\n80,534\n62,968\n40,506\n34,976\n16,275\n53,254\n145,011\n127,445\nAt June 30, 2022\nIn thousands of USD\nWithin \n1 year or on \ndemand\nMore\nthan \n1 year\nbut \nless than \n2 years\nMore than\n2 years\nbut \nless than \n5 years\nMore\nthan \n5 years\nTotal\nCarrying\namount\nat \nJune 30\nTrade payables\n11,970\n-\n-\n-\n11,970\n11,970\nOther payables and accruals\n14,495\n-\n-\n-\n14,495\n14,495\nAmounts due to related party\n19\n-\n-\n-\n19\n19\nBorrowings\n-\n29,627\n-\n-\n29,627\n29,627\nLease liabilities\n5,837\n5,591\n16,851\n50,404\n78,683\n62,187\n32,321\n35,218\n16,851\n50,404\n134,794\n118,298\nInvestment risk\nThe Group is exposed to investment risk from investment transactions such as the purchase of\ncryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products and investment in unlisted equity instruments. These\ninvestments are not principal-guaranteed, and the Group may suffer material loss from such investments. The\nGroup monitors its investments closely and limits its exposure to the investment risk by including in its\noperation strategy the requirements to, with regard to the purchase of cryptocurrency-denoted wealth\nmanagement products, invest only in robust wealth management products and the investments need to be\nredeemed within the same fiscal quarter, and, with regard to the investment in the unlisted equity\ninstruments, perform due diligence on the prospect investees to evaluate the business soundness before\nmaking an investment, and communicate regularly with the investee, review management report and the\nlatest financial statements, if any, to evaluate the stage of investment and whether any action should be\ntaken regarding the investment. The valuation of the unlisted equity investments requires the Group to use\nunobservable inputs, and hence they are subject to uncertainty.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a\nfinancial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from cash deposited in the banks, cryptocurrencies held\nin custody, cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management product\npurchases.\nTo manage risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, the Group only transacts with\nreputable financial institutions. There has been no recent history of default in relation to these financial\ninstitutions.\nF-27 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the six month ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, substantially all of the Group\u2019s cryptocurrencies are\nstored in wallets held in the custody of Matrix Finance and Technologies Holding Company (\u201cMatrixport\nGroup\u201d), a related party. To limit exposure to credit risk relating to cryptocurrencies under custody, the Group\nevaluates the system security design of the custody service provider and regularly reviews the exposure of\ncryptocurrencies held in custody. The Group has further implemented internal controls to ensure the\nappropriate access to the cryptocurrencies under custody and adopted the operating strategy of disposing\nof the cryptocurrency for fiat currency shortly after they are earned. The Group expects that there is no\nsignificant credit risk from non-performance by Matrixport Group.\nHowever, bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future be,\nsubject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A successful security breach or\ncyberattack could result in a partial or total loss of the Group\u2019s cryptocurrencies and such a loss could have\na material adverse effect on the Group\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Group also has credit exposure to cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-\ndenoted wealth management product purchases. The Group assesses such credit risk both at contract\ninception and each quarter or in shorter interval by considering the past collection experience and any\nindications that the corresponding amount may not be fully collected. To manage such exposure, the Group\ncontinuously monitors the relevant factors, such as the liquidity of the underlying cryptocurrencies, and\nnegative report related to the counterparty, and deals only with creditworthy counterparties and includes in\nits operation strategy that the lending needs to be collected, and the wealth management products need to\nbe redeemed within the same fiscal quarter. Currently, the Group only conducts such transactions with the\nMatrixport Group. The Group had never experienced credit losses and has no existing exposures to such\ncredit risk as of each end date of the consolidated statement of financial position. Consequently, credit\nexposure to these transactions is not considered material.\nFair value measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are estimated at a specific point\nin time, by discounting expected cash flows at rates for assets and liabilities of the same remaining maturities\nand conditions. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment,\nand therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the\nestimates.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial\ninstruments by valuation techniques:\nLevel 1 valuation: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2 valuation: inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 valuation: fair value measured using significant unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, except for the investments in unlisted equity instruments\nand USDC, substantially all of the Group\u2019s financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at amortized\ncosts and the carrying amounts approximate their fair values.\nInvestments in unlisted equity instruments are carried at fair value with changes recorded in profit or\nloss. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the fair value of unlisted equity investment\u202f-\u202fInvestment A,\nB and C (Note 10) were determined by the recent transaction price.\nF-28 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, the fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent or\ninvested is measured on a recurring basis at quoted price at the time the fair value of the underlying\ncryptocurrencies is being measured, which the Group considers to be a Level 1 fair value input. The fair\nvalue of the embedded derivative relating to the wealth management product is measured on a recurring\nbasis by taking the net asset value provided by the counterparty, which the Group considers to be a Level 2\nfair value input.\nThe Group\u2019s finance department performs valuations of financial instruments. The finance department\nreports directly to the chief financial officer and discusses valuation processes and results with the chief\nfinancial officer in order to comply with the Group\u2019s accounting and reporting requirements.\nThe valuation procedures applied include consideration of recent transactions in the same security or\nfinancial instrument, recent financing of the investee companies, economic and market conditions, current\nand projected financial performance of the investee companies, and the investee companies\u2019 management\nteam as well as potential future strategies to realize the investments.\nThe fair value measurement hierarchy for the Group\u2019s financial instruments measured at fair value is as\nfollows:\nIn thousands of USD\nValuation technique(s) \nand key input\nDecember\n31, \n2021\nLevel\n1\nLevel\n2\nLevel\n3\nUSDC\nQuoted price\n99\n99\n-\n-\nInvestments in unlisted equity\ninstruments\nRecent transaction price\n1,250\n-\n-\n1,250\nIn thousands of USD\nValuation technique(s) \nand key input\nJune 30, \n2022\nLevel\n1\nLevel\n2\nLevel 3\nUSDC\nQuoted price\n96\n96\n-\n-\nInvestments in unlisted equity \ninstruments\nRecent transaction price\n12,000\n-\n-\n12,000\nDuring the period ended June 30, 2022, there was no transfer between levels.

The Group does not have customer accounting for 10% or\nmore of revenue in other revenue categories in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.\nContract assets and liabilities\nA contract asset is recognized when the Group recognizes revenue before being unconditionally\nentitled to the consideration under the payment terms set out in the contract. Contract assets are assessed\nfor expected credit losses and are reclassified to receivables when the right to the consideration has become\nunconditional. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the Group did not have any contract assets.\nA contract liability is recognized when the customer pays consideration for goods or services before the\nGroup recognizes the related revenue. A contract liability would also be recognized if the Group has an\nunconditional right to receive non-refundable consideration before the Group recognizes the related revenue.\nIn such cases, a corresponding receivable would also be recognized. As of December 31, 2021 and June 30,\n2022, the Group had contract liabilities, presented as deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of financial position, of approximately US$213.4 million and US$217.0 million.

The deposit can be withdrawn on demand and is generally delivered to the Group within 72 hours.\nThe nature of the wealth management product type B is, in essence, a cryptocurrency lending arrangement.\nSee Note 2(h) to the Annual Financial Statements regarding the accounting policy for cryptocurrency\nlending arrangements.\nThe Group received interest income from the lending and return from the wealth management product in\ntotal amount of approximately US$0.4 million and US$0.3 million denoted in cryptocurrencies, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2022, the balances of cryptocurrency receivables and embedded\nderivative were both nil. The change in fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent or invested, and the embedded\nderivative relating to the wealth management product type A are immaterial as the arrangements are short-\nterm in nature and the quoted prices of USDT and USDC are relatively stable.\nTo facilitate the lending and wealth management products purchases, the Group purchased the\naforementioned cryptocurrencies using approximately US$186 million. The total receipts from the collection\nof lending and redemption of wealth management products were disposed of by the Group for approximately\nUS$191 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022.\n21. EARNINGS / (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe calculation of basic earnings / (loss) per share is based on the profit or loss attributable to ordinary\nequity shareholders of the Group and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the six-\nmonth period ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.\nDiluted earnings / (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares\nand dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the respective periods.\nAs the Group incurred losses for the six months ended June 30, 2022, the potential ordinary shares\nrelated to the outstanding share awards and convertible debt were not included in the calculation of dilutive\nloss per share, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nF-46 \n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n(1) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings / (loss) per\nordinary share computations:\nPeriods ended June 30,\nIn thousands of USD, except for the per share data\n2021\n2022\nProfit / (loss) attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the Group\n113,847\n(25,194\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (thousand shares)\n12,662,126\n12,662,126\nEarnings / (loss) per share, basic and diluted (In USD)\n0.01\n(0.00\nEach share of Class A ordinary shares, Series A preferred shares, Series B preferred shares and Series\nB+ preferred shares is granted 1 vote and each share of Class B ordinary shares is granted 10 votes.

ORGANIZATION\nGeneral information\nBitdeer Technologies Holding Company (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cBitdeer\u201d) is a limited liability company\nincorporated in the Cayman Islands on November 18, 2020. The address of its registered office is 89 Nexus\nWay, Camana Bay, Grand Cayman KY1-9009, Cayman Islands.\nThe Company does not conduct any substantive operations on its own but conducts its primary\noperations through its subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries (together, the \u201cGroup\u201d) are principally\nengaged in the following business activities:\nOffering to its customers plan subscriptions, from which the customers receive computing service in\nquantity measured in hash rate and benefit from such service as a result of directing the computing\nservice to mining pools and receiving cryptocurrency rewards (the \u201cCloud Hash Rate business\u201d)\u037e\nUsing the Group\u2019s mining machines to provide computing power to mining pools in exchange for\ncryptocurrency rewards (the \u201cProprietary Mining business\u201d)\u037e and\nProviding dynamic hosting solutions in the Group\u2019s mining datacenters (the \u201cHosting business\u201d,\ntogether with Cloud Hash Rate business and Proprietary Mining business, the \u201cBitdeer Business\u201d).\nReorganization\nSeparation from Bitmain\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the period from January 1, 2021 to January 26,\n2021, the Bitdeer Business and the mining pool business, including the ownership of and registration right to\nthe domain name btc.com (the \u201cBTC.com Pool Business\u201d or \u201cBTC\u201d), were operated through a number of\nentities controlled by BitMain Technologies Holding Company (collectively with its subsidiaries, \u201cBitmain\u201d).\nThe Company was created to separate the Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool Business following a\ncorporate reorganization of Bitmain to effectuate the separation. The separation from Bitmain resulted in the\ntransfer of certain assets, liabilities and contracts related to the Bitdeer Business and the BTC.com Pool\nBusiness at their historical book values from Bitmain to the Company on January 26, 2021, when Bitmain\ndistributed by way of dividend in kind the shares of the Company to the then existing Bitmain shareholders\nand the Company and its subsidiaries began to operate on a stand-alone basis.\nSeparation of the BTC.com Pool Business\nIn February 2021, the Group established Blockchain Alliance Technologies Holding Company\n(\u201cBlockchain Alliance\u201d) to separate the BTC.com Pool Business following a corporate reorganization of the\nGroup to effectuate the separation. The separation was consummated on April 15, 2021, when the Group\ndistributed by way of dividend in kind the shares of Blockchain Alliance to the then existing shareholders of\nthe Group.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na. Basis of preparation\nThe accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d).\nThe combined and consolidated historical financial statements comprise the following financial\ninformation:\nF-55 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n(i) \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe combined financial position of the Bitdeer Business as of December 31, 2020 and the\ncombined results of operations of the Bitdeer Business during the years ended December 31,\n2019 and 2020, and the period from January 1, 2021 to April 15, 2021 (the \u201cCarve-out Period\u201d),\nwhich have been prepared on a carve-out basis\u037e and\nthe consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2021 and the consolidated\nresults of operations of the Group for the period from April 16, 2021 to December 31, 2021, which\nhave been prepared on a consolidated basis (together, the \u201ccombined and consolidated financial\nstatements\u201d).\nPreparing combined financial statements of Bitdeer Business on a carve-out basis\nPursuant to the Reorganization discussed in Note 1, the Group prepared the combined financial\nstatements to capture the stand-alone Bitdeer Business, which has historically operated as part of\nBitmain. The Group also excluded the assets, liabilities, operation results and cash flows of BTC.com\nPool Business from its combined financial statements as a result of the Reorganization. The combined\nfinancial statements have not historically been prepared for the Bitdeer business.\nIn preparing the combined historical financial information, certain accounting conventions commonly\nused for the preparation of combined historical financial information have been applied. The term\n\u201ccombined financial statements\u201d is used when referring to financial information prepared by\naggregating financial statements of separate entities or components of groups that fail to meet the\ndefinition of a \u201cgroup\u201d under IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements. A key assumption underlying\nthe preparation of combined financial statements is that there is a binding element for the economic\nactivities throughout the period presented. The combined financial statements of the Group have been\nprepared by aggregating the financial information of the Bitdeer Business that was bound together by\ncommon control but was not a legal group. Intra-group transactions and the balances and unrealized\ngains or losses have been eliminated in the preparation of the combined financial statements.\nThe combined financial statements of the Bitdeer Business are derived from the historical accounting\nrecords of Bitmain on the following basis:\nThe combined statements of financial position of the Bitdeer Business include all assets and\nliabilities that have been determined to be directly attributable to the Bitdeer Business. Certain\nassets and liabilities historically arising from Bitmain\u2019s business (non Bitdeer Business) have\nbeen attributed to the combined financial statements as they were transferred to the Group\nduring the Reorganization. The most significant of which were due from and due to Bitmain\nbalances recorded under amounts due from related parties and amounts due to related parties\nin the combined and consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2020.\nTransactions between the Bitdeer Business, Bitmain and BTC during the Carve-out Period\nwere accounted for as related party transactions. Internal financing transactions, including\nequity transactions in the nature of internal financing, between the Bitdeer Business, Bitmain\nand BTC are included in the investing and financing activities and operating transactions\nbetween the Bitdeer Business, Bitmain and BTC are included in the operating activities in the\ncombined and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe combined statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss) of the Bitdeer\nBusiness include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Bitdeer Business. These\ninclude certain common operating and administrative expenses incurred by the Bitdeer\nBusiness in conjunction with other business operations of Bitmain and BTC, including\nfinancial, human resources, office administration and other support functions. These costs\nhave been allocated on a basis considered reasonable by management using either specific\nidentification or proportional allocations based on usage, headcount, or other reasonable\nmethods of allocation. Income tax expense was estimated based on the statutory tax rate,\nadjusted as appropriate for\nF-56 \n(iii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe effects of known non-taxable and non-deductible items reported in the combined\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss) as described above. However, the\ncombined financial statements of the Bitdeer Business may not reflect the actual costs that\nwould have been incurred and may not be indicative of the Bitdeer Business\u2019s combined\nresults, financial position, and cash flows had it been operating on a separate, stand-alone\nbasis during the periods presented.\nThe Bitdeer Business did not comprise a separate legal entity or group of entities during the\nCarve-out Period. Therefore, it is not meaningful to present share capital or an analysis of\nreserves. The Group\u2019s equity balance represented the excess or deficits of total assets over\ntotal liabilities and was presented as invested capital in the combined and consolidated\nstatements of financial position. Changes in net assets attributed to the Group are presented\nseparately in the combined and consolidated statement of changes in invested capital and\nequity through the line item \u201cdeemed contribution from / (distribution to) related parties\u201d.\nEquity transactions reflecting the internal financing between Bitdeer Business, Bitmain and\nBTC are included in the financing activities, presented as deemed contribution from /\n(distribution to) related parties, in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nConsolidation\nSubsequent to the Carve-out Period, the Group\u2019s financial information is prepared on a consolidated\nbasis, for which the consolidation policies are described below.\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity where the\nGroup is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the\nability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are\nfully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated\nfrom the date that control ceases.\nInter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and\nits subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides\nevidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been\nchanged where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\nRestatement of financial statements\nPresentation on the sale of mining machines\nDuring 2021, the Group identified an error in presenting the revenue from the sale of the mining machine\nas the difference between the selling price and the remaining net book value of the associated mining\nmachine under IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment. As the sale of mining machines represents\ncontracts with customers in the Group\u2019s ordinary course of business, the transactions should have\nbeen accounted for under IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue from the sale of\nmining machines should have been recognized at the amount of promised consideration to which the\nGroup is expected to be entitled, and the cost of revenue should have been recognized at the net book\nvalue of the mining machines sold. See Note 2(p) for a detailed discussion on the revenue recognition\npolicy associated with the sale of mining machines. The previously reported combined financial\nstatements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 are restated to correct the above error.\nCash flow presentation on the disposal of cryptocurrencies earned from revenue arrangements\nThe Group restated the presentation of disposal of cryptocurrencies earned from revenue arrangements\nfrom operating activities to investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as IAS 7 has\nindicated receipts from sales of intangible assets and debt investments are expected to be classified as\ninvesting activities. See Note 2(h) for the accounting policy related to the disposal of cryptocurrencies.\nF-57 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe combined statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 have been\npresented consistently with current period\u2019s presentation.\nThe effects of the above adjustments on the combined statements of operations and comprehensive\nincome / (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the combined and consolidated\nstatements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, are presented below.\nThese adjustments did not have any impact on the net income / (loss) or the combined statement of\nfinancial position for the periods presented.\nRestated combined and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss)\n2019\n2019\n2019\nIn thousands of USD\nAs\npreviously \nreported\nEffect of adjustment\n- \nsale of mining\nmachines\nAs\nrestated\nRevenue\n83,379\n5,392\n88,771\nCost of revenue\n(93,447\n(5,392\n(98,839\n2020\n2020\n2020\nIn thousands of USD\nAs\npreviously \nreported\nEffect of adjustment\n- \nsale of mining\nmachines\nAs\nrestated\nRevenue\n168,850\n17,537\n186,387\nCost of revenue\n(192,027\n(17,537\n(209,564\nRestated combined and consolidated statements of cash flows\n2019\n2019\n2019\nIn thousands of USD\nAs\npreviously \nreported\nEffect of adjustment\n- \nsale of mining\nmachines\nAs\nrestated\nCash flows from operating activities\n(62,332\n5,729\n(56,603\nCash flows from investing activities\n(168,907\n(5,729\n(174,636\n2020\n2020\n2020\nIn thousands of USD\nAs\npreviously \nreported\nEffect of adjustment\n- \nsale of mining\nmachines\nAs\nrestated\nCash flows from operating activities\n(124,395\n15,219\n(109,176\nCash flows from investing activities\n77,961\n(15,219\n62,742\n2021\n2021\n2021\nIn thousands of USD\nAs\npreviously \nreported\nEffect of adjustment - \ndisposal of\ncryptocurrencies\nAs\nrestated\nCash flows from operating activities\n454,656\n(507,122\n(52,466\nCash flows from investing activities\n(112,553\n507,122\n394,569\nb.

Foreign currency translation\nFunctional and presentation currency\nItems included in the combined and consolidated financial statements of each of the Group\u2019s\nsubsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the\nsubsidiary operates (the \u201cfunctional currency\u201d). The Group presents its combined and consolidated\nfinancial statements in United States Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d, \u201cUS$\u201d, or \u201c$\u201d).\nTransactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions during the year are translated at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the\ntransaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the\nforeign exchange rates ruling at the end of the reporting period. Exchange gains and losses are\nrecognized in profit or loss.\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency\nare translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. The transaction date is\nthe date on which the Group initially recognizes such non-monetary assets or liabilities.\nForeign currency translation\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations that have a functional currency different from\nthe presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\nassets and liabilities for each combined and consolidated statement of financial position presented\nare translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet,\nincome and expenses for each combined and consolidated statement of operations and\ncomprehensive income / (loss) are translated at average exchange rates, and\nall resulting exchange differences are recognized in invested capital and reserves.\nd. Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make\njudgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on\nhistorical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about the carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that\nperiod, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future\nperiods.\nJudgments made by management in the application of IFRSs that have significant effects on the\nfinancial statements and major sources of estimation uncertainty are discussed in Note 3.\nThe outbreak of the 2019 novel strain of coronavirus causing a contagious respiratory disease known as\nCOVID-19, and the subsequent restrictive measures including social distancing, quarantine imposed by\nthe governments around the world, and related travel and trade restrictions have caused disruption to\nbusinesses and resulted in significant global economic impacts. As at the date of this report, these\nimpacts have not had a significant effect on the Group\u2019s financial results or operations. However, as the\nimpact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, including changes in government policy and business\nreactions thereto, if the Group\u2019s staff are unable to work or travel due to illness or government\nrestrictions, the Group may be\nF-59 \n(a) \ni) \nii) \niii) \n(b) \ni) \nii) \niii) \niv) \nv) \nvi) \nvii) \nviii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nforced to reduce or suspend its construction and development activities. In addition, as the COVID-19\npandemic and mitigation measures have also negatively impacted global economic conditions, this, in\nturn, could adversely affect the Group\u2019s business in the future. Due to the continually evolving nature\nof COVID-19, the management cannot reasonably estimate the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic\ncould have on the Group in future periods and believes that any disturbance may be temporary.\nHowever, there is uncertainty about the length and potential impact of any resultant disturbance. As a\nresult, the Group is unable to estimate the potential impact on its future operations as at the date of\nthese financial statements.\ne. Related parties\nA party is considered to be related to the Group if:\nthe party is a person or a close member of that person\u2019s family and that person\nhas control or joint control over the Group\u037e\nhas significant influence over the Group\u037e or\nis a member of the key management personnel of the Group or a parent of the Group\u037e\nthe party is an entity where any of the following conditions applies:\nthe entity and the Group are members of the same Group\u037e\none entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or of a parent, subsidiary or\nfellow subsidiary of the other entity)\u037e\nthe entity and the Group are joint ventures of the same third party\u037e\none entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the\nthird entity\u037e\nthe entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the\nGroup or an entity related to the Group\u037e\nthe entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a)\u037e\na person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the\nkey management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity)\u037e or\nthe entity, or any member of the Group of which it is a part, provides key management\npersonnel services to the Group or the parent of the Group.\nClose members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected to influence, or\nbe influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity.\nTransactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm\u2019s-length basis,\nas the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about\ntransactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were\nconsummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm\u2019s-length transactions unless such\nrepresentations can be substantiated.\nf. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in banks and on hand and short-term, highly liquid\ninvestments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash which are subject to an\ninsignificant risk of\nF-60 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nchanges in value and are within three months of maturity at acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents are\nassessed for expected credit losses. See further discussion regarding expected credit loss in Note 2(t).\nThe Group is required to hold a defined amount of cash as security under the terms of standby letters of\ncredits arrangement. See further discussion in Note 5.\ng. Trade receivables\nTrade receivables are recognized when the Group has an unconditional right to receive consideration. A\nright to receive consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of\nthat consideration is due. Trade receivables are stated at amortized cost, less a loss allowance based on\nlifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. See further discussion regarding expected credit\nloss in Note 2(t).\nh. Cryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies includes USD Coin (\u201cUSDC\u201d) and cryptocurrencies other than USDC held in the\nGroup\u2019s cryptocurrency wallets.\nUSDC\nUSDC is accounted for as a financial instrument as one USDC can be redeemed for one U.S. dollar on\ndemand from the issuer. USDC, classified as a debt investment, is measured at fair value through profit\nor loss.\nCryptocurrencies other than USDC\nCryptocurrencies other than USDC are, by their nature, identifiable non-monetary assets that lack\nphysical substance. Future economic benefits attributable to these cryptocurrencies are expected to\nflow to the Group because these cryptocurrencies can be exchanged for fiat currencies. Furthermore, the\ncost of the Group\u2019s cryptocurrencies other than USDC can be measured using the quoted price of such\ncryptocurrencies at the time the fair value is being measured.\nThe Group accounts for the cryptocurrencies other than USDC as intangible assets with indefinite\nuseful lives in its combined and consolidated statements of financial position because, at the time of\nassessment, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which such assets are expected to generate\ncash flows.\nThe Group further adopts the cost model to account for cryptocurrencies other than USDC and reviews\ntheir useful life and impairment at each reporting date in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The\nGroup accounts for cryptocurrencies other than USDC at cost, instead of revaluing these\ncryptocurrencies at their fair value on each accounting reference date, because the latter model is\nsubject to inherent and substantial volatility in the value of these cryptocurrencies from time to time. In\naddition, the Group believes that the cost model better reflects the Group\u2019s business model, as the\nGroup is not engaged in the cryptocurrency trading business.\nGains or losses arising from the disposal of cryptocurrencies other than USDC are determined as the\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets. The Group\nrecognizes realized gains or losses on the date of the disposal using the first-in-first-out method of\naccounting.\nCryptocurrency lending arrangements\nThe Group enters into arrangements with counterparties to lend cryptocurrencies on an unsecured\nbasis. No collateral is held for the cryptocurrencies lent. Upon lending, the Group derecognizes the\ncryptocurrencies lent and concurrently recognizes cryptocurrency receivables which are measured at\nthe fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent based on their respective quoted prices initially and\nsubsequently on the measurement date and adjusted for expected credit losses. Any differences\nbetween the carrying\nF-61 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\namount of the derecognized cryptocurrencies and the initial measurement of the cryptocurrency\nreceivables, if applicable, and the change in fair value of the cryptocurrencies lent, are recognized in\nother operating income / (expenses) on the combined and consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income / (loss). See further discussion regarding credit losses from cryptocurrency\nreceivables in Note 2(t). Also refer to Note 17 for more information.\nCryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products\nThe Group enters into arrangements with the Matrixport Group, a related party, to purchase\ncryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products which represent units of interest in the\nunderlying cryptocurrency trading account and the value of the units is based on the performance of\nthe trading account managed by the Matrixport Group. The Group derecognizes the cryptocurrencies\npaid and concurrently recognizes a cryptocurrency receivable which gives rise to a variable return\nlinked to the performance of the underlying trading account. The receivable contains an embedded\nderivative which is accounted for separately as an asset or liability based on the change in the fair value\nof the trading account. The cryptocurrency receivable is measured at the fair value of the\ncryptocurrencies invested based on their respective quoted prices on the measurement date and\nadjusted for expected credit losses. Any differences between the carrying amount of the derecognized\ncryptocurrencies and the initial measurement of the cryptocurrency receivables, if applicable, and the\nchange in fair value of the cryptocurrencies invested, are recognized in other operating income /\n(expenses) on the combined and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income /\n(loss). See further discussion regarding credit losses from cryptocurrency receivables in Note 2(t). Also\nrefer to Note 17 for more information.\nThe Group presents the revenue recognized on the acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which is a non-cash\nitem, as an adjustment to remove the non-cash item for the cash flows from operating activities and the\ndisposals of cryptocurrencies received in revenue arrangements are presented as cash flows from\ninvesting activities in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows. The purchases and\ndisposals of cryptocurrencies associated with investment or lending transactions are presented as\ninvesting activities in the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows.\ni. Prepaid expenses and other assets\nPrepaid expenses represent prepayments made for operational purposes, such as prepaid utility fees and\nproperty management expenses. Prepaid expenses are amortized over their future beneficial periods\nusing the straight-line method or at a point in time upon the Group\u2019s receipt of the underlying goods or\nservice.\nOther assets generally consisted of deposits paid to various service providers, such as lessors and\nelectricity vendors.\nj. Intangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortization (where the\nestimated useful life is finite) and impairment losses.\nAmortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line\nbasis over the assets\u2019 estimated useful life, which is the period over which an asset is expected to be\navailable for use. The estimates and associated assumptions of useful life determined by the Group are\nbased on technical or commercial obsolescence, legal or contractual limits on the use of the asset, and\nother relevant factors. The following intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized from the\ndate they are available for use and their estimated useful lives are as follows:\nSoftware\n3\nyears\nBoth the period and method of amortization are reviewed annually.\nF-62 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIntangible assets are not amortized while their useful lives are assessed to be indefinite. Any conclusion\nthat the useful life of an intangible asset is indefinite is reviewed annually to determine whether events\nand circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life assessment for that asset. If they do\nnot, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for prospectively from\nthe date of change and in accordance with the policy for amortization of intangible assets with finite\nlives as set out above.\nk. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment\nlosses, if any.\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at purchase cost. Direct labor and other directly attributable\ncosts incurred to construct new assets and upgrade existing assets are capitalized. Repairs and\nmaintenance expenditures are recognized in the combined and consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income / (loss) as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets as follows:\nBuildings\n20 years\nLand\nUnlimited\nMachinery\n3\u202f-\u202f10 years\nElectronic equipment\n3\u202f-\u202f7 years\nLeasehold improvements\n3 years\nLand acquired by the Group has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.\nThe depreciation method, useful life and residual value of an asset are reviewed at least at each financial\nyear-end and adjusted, if appropriate.\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their cost and the related accumulated depreciation\nare derecognized from the combined and consolidated statements of financial position and the resulting\ngains or losses on the disposal or sale of the assets are recognized in the combined and consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss).\nAn asset under construction is stated at cost until the construction is completed, at which time it is\nreclassified to the property, plant and equipment account to which it relates. During the construction\nperiod until the asset is ready for its intended use or sale, borrowing costs, which include interest\nexpense and foreign currency exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the\nextent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest expense, are capitalized in proportion to the\naverage amount of accumulated expenditures during the period. Capitalization of borrowing costs\nceases when the construction is completed, and the asset is ready for its intended use or sale.\nl. Mining machines\nMining machines refer to the electronic equipment designed for the sole purpose of completing complex\nmathematical functions to verify transactions on the blockchain. Mining machines are stated at cost\nless accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The Group estimated the useful lives of the\nmining machines to be one to two years. This estimate is primarily based on the historical measures of\n(i) the period when each mining machine is able to deliver expected performance and (ii) the frequency\nof technological advancement, which leads to a new generation of mining machines. The Group also\nestimates the residual value of the mining machines at the expected time of disposal, taking into\nconsideration factors such as make and model. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the\nF-63 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nestimated useful lives. The depreciation method, useful life and residual value of the mining machines\nare reviewed at least at each financial year-end and adjusted, if appropriate.\nThe Group routinely sells used mining machines to customers. The net carrying values of the associated\nmining machines were reclassified as inventories when the Group identified such mining machines for\nsale and were recognized as cost of revenue on the combined and consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income / (loss) upon the sale. See Note 2(p).\nWhen mining machines are retired, their costs and the related accumulated depreciation are\nderecognized from the combined and consolidated statements of financial position and the resulting\ngains or losses on the disposal of the assets are recognized in the combined and consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss).\nm. Leases\nThe Group accounts for leases under IFRS 16 Leases. At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses\nwhether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys\nthe right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nAt inception or on a reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates\nthe consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative\nstand-alone prices.\nAt the lease commencement date, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, except\nfor short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets which,\nfor the Group, are primarily vehicles. When the Group enters into a lease in respect of a low-value asset,\nthe Group decides whether to capitalize the lease on a lease-by-lease basis. The lease payments\nassociated with those leases which are not capitalized are recognized as an expense on a systematic\nbasis over the lease term.\nWhere the lease is capitalized, the lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of the lease\npayments payable over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that\nrate cannot be readily determined, using a relevant incremental borrowing rate. After initial recognition,\nthe lease liability is measured at amortized cost and interest expense is calculated using the effective\ninterest method. Variable lease payments linked to the use of an underlying asset are excluded from the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities.\nThe right-of-use asset recognized when a lease is capitalized is initially measured at cost, which\ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability plus any lease payments made at or before the\ncommencement date, and any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use asset is subsequently stated\nat cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets are\nsubsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of\nthe end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the unexpired term of the lease. The\nestimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property,\nplant and equipment.\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change\nin an index or rate, or there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable\nunder a residual value guarantee, or there is a change arising from the reassessment of whether the\nGroup will be reasonably certain to exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease\nliability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the\nright-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has\nbeen reduced to zero.\nn. Trade payables and other payables and accruals\nTrade payables are obligations to pay for goods and/or services that have been acquired from suppliers\nin the ordinary course of business. Other payables and accruals primarily represent obligations to pay\nstaff costs, surtaxes and value-added tax, and other operating service providers.\nF-64 \ni) \nii) \niii) \niv) \nv) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTrade payables and other payables and accruals are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently\nmeasured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\no. Share-based payments\nEmployees (including senior executives and members of the board of directors) and certain service\nproviders of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions,\nwhereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments (\u201cequity-settled transactions\u201d).\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which\nthey are granted.\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity,\nover the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on\nwhich the beneficiary becomes fully entitled to the equity-settled transactions (the \u201cvesting date\u201d). The\ncumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting\ndate reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company\u2019s best estimate of the\nnumber of equity-settled transactions that will ultimately vest which includes assumptions on the\nnumber of equity-settled transactions to be forfeited due to the grantees\u2019 failing to fulfill the service\ncondition, and forfeitures following the non-completion of performance conditions.\np. Revenue recognition\nThe Group\u2019s revenues are derived principally from the cloud hash rate arrangements, the proprietary\nmining arrangements, the cloud hosting arrangements, the sales of mining machines, and the general\nhosting arrangements.\nRevenue is recognized when control over goods or services is transferred to the customer, at the\namount of promised consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled. Revenue excludes\nvalue-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) or other sales taxes and is after deduction of trade discount, if any.\nRevenue is recognized applying the following five steps:\nIdentify the contract with a customer\u037e\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract\u037e\nDetermine the transaction price\u037e\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\u037e and\nRecognize revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation.\nFor arrangements priced at fiat currency, the Group recognizes revenue based on the contract price. For\narrangement priced at cryptocurrency, the Group recognizes revenue based on the spot price of the\ncryptocurrency to fiat currency on the date when it is earned.\nWhen another party is involved in providing services to a customer, the Group is the principal if it\ncontrols the specified services before those services are transferred to the customer.\nThe primary sources of the Group\u2019s revenues are recognized as follows:\nCloud Hash Rate\nThe Group enters into Cloud Hash Rate arrangements with its customers by offering hash rate\nsubscription plans to provide computing power in a specified quantity, measured by computing power\nper second, or hash rate, derived from the mining machines held by the Group, for a specified period of\ntime. The customer also needs to pay for electricity subscriptions, which are billed separately, to\nmaintain\nF-65 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe mining machines that produce the subscribed hash rate over the contract period. The Group\nconnects such computing power to a customer-designated mining pool under the instructions of the\ncustomer to simplify the customer\u2019s mining experiences. As a result of directing the connection of such\ncomputing power to the mining pools, the customers are entitled to the mining rewards, which are\ndirectly transferred from mining pools to the customer-designated cryptocurrency wallets.\nThe Group offers a number of different hash rate subscription plans by plan duration and type of\ncryptocurrency to be mined. The Group offers electricity subscriptions in short durations and a\ncustomer needs to purchase electricity subscriptions multiple times to cover the duration of the hash\nrate subscription plan. The price of the electricity subscription is fixed at the commencement of each\nelectricity subscription period but subject to adjustment from period to period. Both cryptocurrency and\nfiat currency are accepted as payments under the Cloud Hash Rate arrangements. Furthermore, the hash\nrate subscription plans are offered under two modes. Under the classic mode, the customer receives all\nof the mining rewards from the mining pool. Under the accelerator mode, the customer pays a relatively\nlower computing power subscription fee. In exchange, the Group is entitled to additional consideration\nonce the customer\u2019s cost is recovered.\nThe Group offers two promises under the Cloud Hash Rate arrangement. One is to provide a specified\nquantity of computing power during a period of time and the other is to provide maintenance services\nfor computing power generation for a period of time. The two promises are highly interrelated and are\nnot separately identifiable because the customers expect to receive the computing power as a combined\noutput from the hash rate subscription plan and the electricity subscription plan. The two promises\nprovide a series of distinct services, which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, over a period of time. As a result, the promises are treated as a single\nperformance obligation satisfied over time.\nThe transaction price of the performance obligation includes the subscription prices for the hash rate\nsubscription plans and the electricity subscription plans. As the price for the electricity subscription\nplans may change each electricity subscription period, the Group allocates the variable consideration to\neach electricity subscription period.\nThe control of the computing power has been transferred to the customers simultaneously as the\ncustomers consume the benefits from the computing power. The revenue is recognized over time where\nthe consideration related to the hash rate subscription is recognized evenly over the contract term and\nthe electricity subscription is allocated to and recognized evenly over each electricity subscription\nperiod.\nFor plans under the accelerator mode, besides the aforementioned subscription prices, the transaction\nprice also includes the additional consideration once the customer\u2019s cost is recovered. The additional\nconsideration, which is variable, is determined as a percentage of a customer\u2019s mining profit derived\nfrom the subscribed computing power and constrained until the mining pool operator finishes the\ncalculation of the mining reward related to the mining activity in a given day. The Group includes such\nadditional consideration in the transaction price and recognizes the revenue when the Group can\nreasonably calculate the amount and determine it is probable a significant reversal will not occur.\nProprietary Mining\nThe Group enters into contracts with mining pool operators to provide computing power generated from\nthe Group\u2019s own mining machines to the mining pools. The contracts with mining pool operators are\nterminable at any time by either party. In exchange for providing computing power to the mining pool,\nthe Group is entitled to cryptocurrency rewards from the mining pool operators, which is a variable\nconsideration calculated based on a predetermined formula agreed by the Group and the mining pool\noperator as a part of the arrangement. The variable consideration is constrained until the Group can\nreasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the end of a given day based on the actual\namount of computing power provided to the mining pool operators. By then, the Group considers it is\nhighly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenues will not occur and includes such\nvariable\nF-66 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nconsideration in the transaction price. Providing computing power is an output of the Group\u2019s ordinary\nactivities and the only performance obligation in the Group\u2019s contracts with mining pool operators. The\nGroup recognizes the revenue when the variable consideration is no longer constrained and the\nperformance obligation of providing computing power has been satisfied. Although the cryptocurrency\nrewards the mining pool operators receive from the blockchain networks include both the block rewards\nand the transaction verification fees, the transaction price the Group receives is an aggregate amount\nand primarily includes the block rewards. As a result, the Group does not present disaggregated\nrevenue information on block rewards and transaction verification fees.\nCloud Hosting\nThe Group provides its customers, through subscription of Cloud Hosting orders, one-stop mining\nmachines hosting solution which integrates the provision of computing power generated from specified\nsecond-hand mining machines and the provision of maintenance service, primarily including electricity\nsupply and daily maintenance and repair care. The Group charges the customer an upfront fixed amount\nat the commencement of the Cloud Hosting arrangement for the customer to secure the procurement of\nthe computing power from the specified mining machines, as well as the variable fees for the provision\nof maintenance service based on the consumption of resources such as electricity throughout the\nduration of the service. The Group historically only accepts cryptocurrency as payments for services\nunder the Cloud Hosting arrangement.\nThe Cloud Hosting arrangements are offered under two modes. Under the classic mode, the customer\nreceives all of the mining rewards from the mining pool. Under the accelerator mode, the customer is\ncharged with a lower upfront amount and enjoys a quicker recovery of the costs. In exchange, the Group\nis entitled to additional consideration once a customer\u2019s cost is recovered.\nTwo promises are offered under the Cloud Hosting arrangements. One is to provide the computing\npower generated from the specified mining machines and the other is to perform maintenance services\nover the life of the mining machines. The two promises are not separately identifiable because the\ncustomer expects to receive a steady operation of the mining machines specified in the Cloud Hosting\norder, which is a combined output of the provision of computing power from the specified mining\nmachines and the provision of maintenance service of the specified mining machines. The two promises\nprovide a series of distinct services, which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, over a period of time. As a result, the promises are treated as a single\nperformance obligation satisfied over time.\nThe transaction price of the performance obligation includes an upfront fee paid upon placement of the\nCloud Hosting order and periodical maintenance fees. The periodical maintenance fee is variable in each\nmaintenance period based on the electricity consumption. The Group allocates the variable\nconsideration to each distinct maintenance service period.\nThe revenue is recognized over time where the fixed upfront fee is recognized evenly over the contract\nterm and the periodical maintenance fee is recognized over each respective service period. The contract\nterm approximates to the life of the specified mining machines and is estimated to be two years. The\nestimated life of these mining machines is reviewed at least at each financial year-end and adjusted if the\nexpectation of the realization of economic benefits from the specified mining machines is different from\nthe previous estimate.\nFor plans under the accelerator mode, besides the aforementioned fees, the transaction price also\nincludes the additional consideration once the customer\u2019s cost is recovered. The additional\nconsideration, which is variable, is determined as a percentage of a customer\u2019s mining profit derived\nfrom the computing power of the specified mining machines and constrained until the mining pool\noperator finishes the calculation of the mining reward related to the mining activity in a given day. The\nGroup includes such additional consideration in the transaction price and recognizes revenues when the\nGroup can reasonably calculate\nF-67 \n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe amount and determine it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. For all the periods\npresented, no revenue was generated from the additional consideration from Cloud Hosting\narrangements offered under the accelerator mode.\nSale of Mining Machines\nThe Group recognizes revenue from sales of mining machines to customers at the point in time when\ncontrol of the mining machines is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment of\nthe mining machines as defined in the revenue contract. Sale of mining machine is the sole performance\nobligation in this type of arrangement. The Group accepts both cryptocurrency and fiat currency as\npayments for sales of mining machines.\nGeneral Hosting\nThe Group provides general hosting services, which is a combined service package including custody\nof the customers\u2019 mining machines, electricity and network maintenance and other services, that enable\ncustomers to run blockchain computing operations. The customer is only able to benefit from the\nhosting service as a package and the Group has a single performance obligation. The hosting service\nfee is charged to the customer monthly as a single fee based on the customer\u2019s consumption of\nresources, such as the amount of electricity used in a period. Revenue from the general hosting service\nis recognized across each service cycle. The Group accepts both cryptocurrency and fiat currency as\npayments for the hosting services.\nDetails of revenues for each category are as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\nIn thousands of USD\n2019 \n(Restated)\n2020 \n(Restated)\n2021\nProprietary mining\n37,471\n88,493\n191,693\nCloud hash rate\nHash rate subscription\n18,678\n31,389\n53,952\nElectricity subscription\n24,821\n45,242\n35,113\nAdditional consideration from Cloud Hash Rate arrangements\noffered under accelerator mode\n-\n1,657\n35,140\nSales of mining machines\n7,507\n15,844\n45,693\nCloud hosting arrangements \n-\n2,929\n7,568\nGeneral hosting\n-\n-\n18,312\nOthers \n294\n833\n7,190\nTotal revenues\n88,771\n186,387\n394,661\nOthers include revenue generated primarily from providing management services and the sale of mining\nmachine peripherals.\nThe Group did not generate any revenue from the additional consideration from Cloud Hosting\narrangements offered under accelerator mode for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, the Group generates 78.73%, 51.47% and 1.49%\nof Proprietary Mining business revenue from Bitmain under the brand of AntPool, representing 33.23%,\n24.44% and 0.72% of total revenue respectively, and 12.64%, 48.04% and 91.99% of Proprietary Mining\nbusiness revenue from BTC, representing 5.34%, 22.81% and 44.68% of total revenue respectively. The\nGroup did not have any other customer that accounts for 10% or more of total revenue in the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nF-68 \n(2)\n(1)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nContract assets and liabilities\nA contract asset is recognized when the Group recognizes revenue before being unconditionally\nentitled to the consideration under the payment terms set out in the contract. Contract assets are\nassessed for expected credit losses and are reclassified to receivables when the right to the\nconsideration has become unconditional. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Group did not have any\ncontract assets.\nA contract liability is recognized when the customer pays consideration for goods or services before the\nGroup recognizes the related revenue. A contract liability would also be recognized if the Group has an\nunconditional right to receive non-refundable consideration before the Group recognizes the related\nrevenue. In such cases, a corresponding receivable would also be recognized. As of December 31, 2020\nand 2021, the Group had contract liabilities, presented as deferred revenue on the combined and\nconsolidated statements of financial position, of approximately US$11.6 million and US$213.4 million.\nApproximately US$0.2 million, US$10.3 million and US$11.1 million, included in the deferred revenue\nbalance at January 1, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, was recognized as revenue during the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nq. Cost of revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of electricity expenses incurred for operating the Group\u2019s mining\nmachines in its revenue-generating activities, depreciation expense from the mining machines and\ndatacenters hosting those mining machines, costs of mining machines sold to customers, and\ncompensation expenses incurred by mining datacenter personnel.\nr. Taxes\nIncome tax\nCurrent and deferred income taxes are recognized as income or expense and included in the combined\nand consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income / (loss), except to the extent that\nthe income tax relates to items recognized in comprehensive income / (loss) or directly in equity, in\nwhich case the relevant amounts of tax are recognized in comprehensive income / (loss) or directly in\nequity, respectively.\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered or paid\nby using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting\ndate. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax reporting process with respect to\nsituations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. Where appropriate,\nmanagement establishes provisions based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from deductible and taxable temporary differences respectively,\nbeing the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting\npurposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets also arise from unused tax losses and unused tax\ncredits.\nApart from the temporary differences arising from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, all deferred\ntax liabilities, and all deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be\navailable against which the asset can be utilized, are recognized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and tax laws at each reporting date which are\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it is no\nlonger probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to compensate part or all of the benefits of\ndeferred tax assets. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and\nrecognized\nF-69 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nif it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for recovery. Tax deductions arising from the\nreversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from estimates of future taxable income.\nDeferred taxes on transactions which are recognized outside profit or loss are recognized outside profit\nor loss. Therefore, deferred taxes on these transactions are recognized either in comprehensive income /\n(loss) or recognized directly in equity.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the combined and consolidated statements of financial\nposition, if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and liabilities and\nthe deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same Tax Authority on either\nthe same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and\nassets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future\nperiod in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or\nsettled.\nUncertainty over income tax treatments\nThe Group determines the recognition and measurement of tax assets and liabilities that contain\nuncertainty over income tax by considering the assumptions used in the examination of tax treatments\nby the tax authorities, the probability that the tax authorities will accept uncertain tax treatment and re-\nconsideration or estimation if there is a change in facts and circumstances.\nIf the acceptance of tax treatment is probable, the measurement is in line with income tax fillings. If the\nacceptance of tax treatment is not probable, the Group uses tax amounts using the method that provides\na better prediction of resolution (i.e., most likely amount or expected value). Due to the complexity of\nsome of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different\nfrom current estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expenses in\nthe periods in which they are determined.\ns. Financial instruments\nThe Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in the accounting of financial instruments. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, all existing financial instruments are classified and measured at amortized\ncost, except for USDC, which is discussed in Note 2(h).\nThe Group\u2019s financial assets, other than USDC, are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest\nmethod less provision for impairment. Gains and losses arising from the disposal, being the differences\nbetween the net sales proceeds and the carrying values, are recognized in the statements of operations\nand comprehensive income / (loss).\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or\nthe Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.\nThe Group\u2019s financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortized cost using the effective interest\nmethod.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when, and only when, the Group\u2019s obligations are discharged,\ncanceled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized\nand the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the statement of\nfinancial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and\nthere is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities\nsimultaneously.\nConvertible debt\nAs disclosed in Note 11, in 2021, the Group issued a convertible debt that can be converted into\nordinary shares of the Group at the option of the holder. The number of shares to be issued is fixed and\ndoes not\nF-70 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nvary with changes in fair value. The Group accounts for the components of this compound financial\ninstrument separately as a financial liability and an equity instrument. The liability component of the\nconvertible debt is initially recognized at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity\nconversion option. The equity component is initially recognized at the difference between the fair value\nof the convertible debt as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable\ntransaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial\ncarrying amounts. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of the convertible debt is\nmeasured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component is not\nremeasured.\nInterest related to the financial liability is recognized in profit or loss. Upon conversion, the financial\nliability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss will be recognized.\nt. Credit losses and impairment of assets\n(i) Credit losses from financial instruments\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses (\u201cECL\u201d) on financial assets, such as\ncash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade receivable, which are measured at amortized cost.\nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present\nvalue of all expected cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in\naccordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). The expected cash\nshortfalls are discounted using the following discount rates where the effect of discounting is material:\nfixed-rate financial assets, trade and other receivables: effective interest rate determined at initial\nrecognition or an approximation thereof\u037e\nvariable-rate financial assets: current effective interest rate.\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which\nthe Group is exposed to credit risk.\nIn measuring ECLs, the Group takes into account reasonable and supportable information that is\navailable without undue cost or effort. This includes information about past events, current conditions\nand forecasts of future economic conditions.\nECLs are measured on either of the following bases:\n12-month ECLs: these are losses that are expected to result from possible default events within the 12\nmonths after the reporting date\u037e and\nlifetime ECLs: these are losses that are expected to result from all possible default events over the\nexpected lives of the items to which the ECL model applies.\nLoss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. ECL on\nthis type of financial asset is estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group\u2019s historical credit\nloss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors and an assessment of both the\ncurrent and forecast general economic conditions at the reporting date.\nFor all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes a loss allowance equal to 12-month ECLs\nunless there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of the financial instrument since initial\nrecognition, in which case the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.\nSignificant increases in credit risk\nIn assessing whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument assessed at\nF-71 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe reporting date with that assessed at the date of initial recognition. In making this reassessment, the\nGroup considers that a default event occurs when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations\nto the Group in full and without recourse. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative\ninformation that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking\ninformation that is available without undue cost or effort.\nIn particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has\nincreased significantly since initial recognition:\nfailure to make payments of principal or interest on their contractually due dates\u037e\nan actual or expected significant deterioration in a financial instrument\u2019s external or internal credit\nrating (if available)\u037e\nan actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor\u037e and\nexisting or forecast changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment that have a\nsignificant adverse effect on the debtor\u2019s ability to meet its obligation to the Group.\nDepending on the nature of the financial instruments, the assessment of a significant increase in credit\nrisk is performed on either an individual basis or a collective basis. When the assessment is performed\non a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics,\nsuch as past-due status and credit risk ratings.\nECLs are remeasured at each reporting date to reflect changes in the financial instrument\u2019s credit risk\nsince initial recognition. Any change in the ECL amount is recognized as an impairment gain or loss in\nprofit or loss.\nThe Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding\nadjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.\nImpairment and write-off policy\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset is credit-impaired. A financial asset\nis credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash\nflows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable events:\nsignificant financial difficulties of the debtor\u037e\na breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments\u037e\nis becoming probable that the borrower will enter into bankruptcy or other financial reorganization\u037e\nsignificant changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment that have an adverse\neffect on the debtor\u037e or\nthe disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties of the issuer.\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that\nthere is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the\ndebtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the\namounts subject to the write-off.\nSubsequent recoveries of an asset that was previously written off are recognized as a reversal of\nimpairment in profit or loss in the period in which the recovery occurs.\nF-72 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(ii) Credit losses from cryptocurrency receivables\nThe Group recognizes an allowance for cryptocurrency receivables using the general expected credit\nlosses model in manner a similar to the model and consideration used for assessing credit losses from\nfinancial instruments discussed above. Under this model, the Group calculates the allowance for credit\nlosses by considering on a discounted basis, all expected shortfalls which are the difference between\nthe quantity of cryptocurrency due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the quantity of\ncryptocurrency that the Group expects to receive, in various default scenarios for prescribed future\nperiods and multiplying the shortfalls by the probability of each scenario occurring. The allowance on\nthe financial asset is the sum of these probability-weighted outcomes.\nThe Group considers both internal and external, and quantitative and qualitative factors when\nestimating ECL for cryptocurrency receivables such as the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the\nresult of the historical transactions with the counterparty, the business practice of the counterparty,\nregulatory development relating to the industry, liquidity of the underlying cryptocurrency, and the\ntrend of the general economy.\nThe Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss for expected credit losses from cryptocurrency\nreceivables with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.\nSubsequent recoveries of cryptocurrency receivables previously written off are recognized as a reversal\nof impairment in profit or loss in the period in which the recovery occurs.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the balance of cryptocurrency receivables was nil and no\ncryptocurrency receivable was past due. No allowance, write-offs or recoveries were recognized against\nthe cryptocurrency receivables for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n(iii) Impairment of other assets\nInternal and external sources of information are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to identify\nindications that the following assets may be impaired or, an impairment loss previously recognized no\nlonger exists or may have decreased:\nproperty, plant and equipment\u037e\nlease right-of-use assets\u037e\nintangible assets\u037e and\ncryptocurrency other than USDC.\nIf any such indication exists, the asset\u2019s recoverable amount is estimated. In addition, for\ncryptocurrency other than USDC, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date whether or\nnot there is any indication of impairment.\nCalculation of recoverable amount\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in\nuse. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value\nusing a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and\nthe risks specific to the asset. Where an asset does not generate cash inflows largely independent of\nthose from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest group of assets that\ngenerates cash inflows independently (i.e., a cash-generating unit).\nThe recoverable amount of cryptocurrency other than USDC is based on the fair value less costs of\ndisposal. The fair value of these cryptocurrencies is measured using the quoted price of the\ncryptocurrencies at the time the fair value is being measured.\nRecognition of impairment losses\nF-73 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAn impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset, or the cash-\ngenerating unit to which it belongs, exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognized in\nrespect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if\nany) allocated to the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying amount of\nthe other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro-rata basis, except that the carrying value of an\nasset will not be reduced below its individual fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable) or value in\nuse (if determinable).\nReversals of impairment losses\nAn impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine\nthe recoverable amount.\nA reversal of an impairment loss is limited to the asset\u2019s carrying amount that would have been\ndetermined had no impairment loss been recognized in prior years. Reversals of impairment losses are\ncredited to profit or loss in the year in which the reversals are recognized.\nu. Provisions\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of\na past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required\nto settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The timing\nor amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the\nexpenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into\naccount risks and uncertainties associated with the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the\ntime value of money is considered material.\nv. Segment information\nOperating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that\nare regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the\nsegments and to assess their performances.\nAn operating segment is a component of an entity:\nthat engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including\nrevenues and expenses relating to the transactions with other components of the same entity)\u037e\nwhose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity\u2019s chief operating decision maker to make\ndecisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance\u037e and\nfor which discrete financial information is available.\nThe chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions based on internal management\nfunctions and assesses the Group\u2019s business performance as one integrated business instead of by\nseparate business lines or geographical regions. Accordingly, the Group has only one operating\nsegment and therefore, no segment information is presented.\nDisaggregated revenue data by geographical region in terms of the customer\u2019s location within the\noperating segment is as follows:\nF-74 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYears ended December 31,\nIn thousands of USD\n2019 \n(Restated)\n2020 \n(Restated)\n2021\nSingapore\n34,499\n90,808\n79,537\nAsia, excluding Singapore\n36,504\n57,146\n211,805\nNorth America\n9,468\n24,063\n75,559\nEurope\n6,377\n7,755\n15,487\nOthers\n1,923\n6,615\n12,273\nTotal\n88,771\n186,387\n394,661\nSelected assets of mining machines, property plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible\nassets by geographical region within the operating segment is as follows:\nAt December 31,\n2020\n2021\nSingapore\n914\n7,481\nNorth America\n99,812\n181,864\nEurope\n20,578\n18,797\nAsia, excluding Singapore\n13,898\n-\nTotal\n135,202\n208,142\nw. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the income attributable to equity shareholders of the\nGroup by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the income attributable to equity shareholders of\nthe Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, after\nadjusting for the effects of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nWhen calculating basic loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the denominator\nfor the period prior to the Reorganization included the number of shares issued in the Reorganization, as\nif the Reorganization occurred prior to or as of January 1, 2019.\nx. Initial application of new or amended standards during the reporting periods\nAs from January 1, 2021, the Group adopted the following recently issued or amended standards.

So far, the Group has\nconcluded that the adoption of these standards and interpretations is unlikely to have a significant\nimpact on the Group\u2019s financial position.\n3. USE OF JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nEstimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other\nfactors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates\nmay not be equal to the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of\ncausing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year\nare discussed below.\nDepreciation of mining machines\nDepreciation on the Group\u2019s mining machines is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate\ncosts up to residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Group reviews the useful lives\nand residual values at least at each financial year-end and adjusted, if appropriate, to ensure that the method\nand rates of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of realization of economic benefits from\nmining machines. The Group estimates the useful lives of mining machines based on historical experience,\ntaking into account anticipated technological changes. If there are significant changes from previously\nestimated useful lives, the amount of depreciation expenses may change.\nThe useful life of mining machines is changed from one year to one to two years as a result of the\nreview conducted in July 2021. The impact of the change in useful life is an increase in the profit before\nincome tax in 2021 for an amount of approximately US$12 million.\nF-76 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCryptocurrency accounting\nThe cryptocurrency market is still a new market and is highly volatile and historical prices are not\nnecessarily indicative of future value. A significant change in the market prices for cryptocurrencies would\nhave a significant impact on the Group\u2019s earnings and financial position.\nIf circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of cryptocurrencies other than USDC may not be\nrecoverable, the assets may be considered \u201cimpaired\u201d, and an impairment loss may be recognized in\naccordance with the accounting policy for impairment of cryptocurrencies other than USDC as described in\nNote 2(t).\nWhen such a decline has occurred, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The\nrecoverable amount is based on the fair value less costs of disposal. Furthermore, for USDC, the carrying\nbalance of USDC at the date of the combined and consolidated statements of financial position is adjusted to\nits fair value with changes recorded through profit or loss.\nThe fair value of the cryptocurrencies is measured at quoted price at the time the fair value of\ncryptocurrencies is being measured, which the Group considers to be predominantly a Level 1 fair value\ninput under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurement of the\ncryptocurrencies lent or invested and the embedded derivatives related to cryptocurrency lending\narrangements and cryptocurrency-denoted wealth management product purchases are discussed in Note 4.\nChanges in these estimates could have a significant impact on the amount of the assets and could result in\nadditional impairment charges or reversal of impairment and gain or loss from changes in fair value in future\nperiods.\nWith respect to the cryptocurrency receivables recognized for the cryptocurrency lending or wealth\nmanagement products, the Group evaluates the expected credit losses on such receivables by considering\nboth internal and external, quantitative and qualitative factors and utilizing the general expected credit losses\nmodel as described in Note 2(t).\nRevenue from the proprietary mining business\nThere is currently no specific definitive guidance in IFRS or alternative accounting frameworks for the\naccounting for the revenue from the proprietary mining business. The Group\u2019s management has exercised\nsignificant judgment in determining appropriate accounting treatment for the recognition of revenue from the\nproprietary mining business. Management has examined various factors surrounding the substance of the\nGroup\u2019s operations, such as the reliability of the measurement of the cryptocurrencies received.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect\nmanagement\u2019s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. The Group is subject to income taxes in\nSingapore and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining\nthe income tax expense.\nIn determining the current income tax provision, management assesses temporary differences resulting\nfrom differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, which are recorded in the combined and consolidated statements of financial position.\nWhen management assesses deductible temporary differences, including those originating from tax losses\ncarried forward, management must assess the probability that these will be recovered through adjustments to\nfuture taxable income. To the extent the management believes recovery is not probable, no deferred tax asset\nis recognized.\nForecasting future income requires the use of a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future\nincome, management uses internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. Management\ndevelops its budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends and economic and industry\nF-77 \na. \ni. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nforecasts influencing the Group\u2019s performance. Significant changes in management\u2019s judgment related to the\nexpected realizability of deductible temporary differences result in an adjustment to the associated deferred\ntax asset.\nThe calculation of income tax expense involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex\ntax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Management recognizes tax\nbenefits related to uncertain tax positions when, in management\u2019s judgment, it is more likely than not that\nsuch positions will be sustained on examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation,\nbased on the technical merits. Management adjusts liabilities for uncertain tax positions when its judgment\nchanges as a result of new information previously unavailable. Due to the complexity of some of these\nuncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from current\nestimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expenses in the periods in\nwhich they are determined.\nShare-based payments\nThe determination of the fair value of the Group\u2019s ordinary shares and the share awards granted under\nthe 2021 Share Incentive Plan involves significant judgment and estimates. The Group determined the fair\nvalue of the share awards using the Binomial option valuation model. Estimates such as stock price,\nvolatility of the Group\u2019s ordinary shares, risk-free interest rate, exercise multiple and the expected dividend\nyield were used in the valuation model.\nThe Group determined the fair value of the Group\u2019s ordinary shares, or the stock price, used in the\ndetermination of the fair value of the share awards, using the discounted cash flow model. Estimates such as\nthe Group\u2019s stage of development, financial condition and operating results, general market conditions and\nthe lack of marketability of the Group\u2019s ordinary shares were used in the valuation model.\nThe fair value of the Group\u2019s ordinary shares and the share awards were determined by the Group with\nthe assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm.\n4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFinancial risk factors\nThe Group is exposed to various market risks including cryptocurrency risk, interest rate risk,\ninvestment risk and foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has designed\nand implemented various risk management strategies, discussed further below, to ensure the exposure to\nthese risks is consistent with its risk tolerance and business objectives.\nMarket risk\nCryptocurrency risk\nThe Group is exposed to cryptocurrency risk as it yields cryptocurrencies from certain revenue\narrangements. The Group recognizes revenue based on the spot fair value of cryptocurrencies\non the day they are earned, but the value of the cryptocurrencies is subject to change on the\ndate they are disposed of for fiat currency.\nCryptocurrency prices are affected by various forces including global supply and demand,\ninterest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation and the global political and economic\nconditions. The profitability of the Group is highly correlated to the current and future market\nprice of cryptocurrencies and a decline in the market prices for cryptocurrencies could\nnegatively impact the Group\u2019s future operations. In addition, the Group may not be able to\nliquidate its holdings of cryptocurrencies at its desired price if required, or, in extreme market\nconditions, the Group may not be able to liquidate its holdings of cryptocurrencies at all.\nF-78 \nii. \niii. \niv. \nb. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCryptocurrencies have a limited history, and the fair value of cryptocurrencies has been very\nvolatile. The historical performance of cryptocurrencies is not indicative of their future price\nperformance. The Group\u2019s cryptocurrencies currently primarily consist of bitcoin. The Group\ncurrently does not use any derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to cryptocurrency risk,\nbut management closely monitors the impact of the mainstream cryptocurrency exchange\nmarket on the change of exchange rates from cryptocurrency to fiat currency. The Group limits\nits exposure to the cryptocurrency risk by including in its operation strategy to dispose of the\ncryptocurrencies for fiat currency shortly after they are earned.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group\u2019s interest rate risk is primarily attributable to bank deposits, restricted cash and\nborrowings. Bank deposits, restricted cash and borrowings at variable rates and fixed rates\nexpose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively.\nManagement closely monitors the fluctuation of such rates periodically.\nInvestment risk\nThe Group is exposed to investment risk from investment transactions such as the purchase of\ncryptocurrency-denoted wealth management products. These products are not principal-\nguaranteed, and the Group may suffer material loss from such investments. The Group\nmonitors its investments closely and limits its exposure to the investment risk by including in\nits operation strategy the requirements to invest only in robust wealth management products\nand the investments need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter.\nForeign currency risk\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as it conducts transactions which give rise to\npayables and cash balances that are denominated in foreign currencies and the fair value or\nfuture cash flows of the Group\u2019s financial instrument may fluctuate due to movement in\nforeign exchange rates of these foreign currencies. The volatility of exchange rates depends\non many factors that the Group is not able to accurately forecast. Management is closely\nmonitoring the Group\u2019s exposure to currency risk and seeks to minimize its exposure to such\nrisk. The Group was not exposed to material foreign currency risk during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting\nin a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from cash deposited in the banks,\ncryptocurrencies held in custody, cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-\ndenoted wealth management product purchases.\nTo manage risk arising from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, the Group only transacts\nwith reputable financial institutions. There has been no recent history of default in relation to these\nfinancial institutions.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Group\u2019s\ncryptocurrencies are stored in wallets held in the custody of Matrix Finance and Technologies\nHolding Company (\u201cMatrixport Group\u201d), a related party. To limit exposure to credit risk relating to\ncryptocurrencies under custody, the Group evaluates the system security design of the custody\nservice provider and regularly reviews the exposure of cryptocurrencies held in custody. The\nGroup has further implemented internal controls to ensure the appropriate access to the\ncryptocurrencies under custody and adopted the operating strategy of disposing of the\ncryptocurrency for fiat currency shortly after they are earned. The Group expects that there is no\nsignificant credit risk from non-performance by Matrixport Group.\nF-79 \nc. \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nHowever, bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future\nbe, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A successful security\nbreach or cyberattack could result in a partial or total loss of the Group\u2019s cryptocurrencies and\nsuch a loss could have a material adverse effect on the Group\u2019s financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Group also has credit exposure to cryptocurrency lending transactions and cryptocurrency-\ndenoted wealth management product purchases. The Group assesses such credit risk both at\ncontract inception and each quarter or in shorter interval by considering the past collection\nexperience and any indications that the corresponding amount may not be fully collected. To\nmanage such exposure, the Group continuously monitors the relevant factors, such as the liquidity\nof the underlying cryptocurrencies, negative report related to the counterparty, and deals only with\ncreditworthy counterparties and includes in its operation strategy that the lending needs to be\ncollected, and the wealth management products need to be redeemed within the same fiscal quarter.\nCurrently, the Group only conducts such transactions with the Matrixport Group. The Group had\nnever experienced credit losses and has no existing exposures to such credit risk as of each end\ndate of the combined and consolidated statement of financial position. Consequently, credit\nexposure to these transactions is not considered material.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk arises in situations where the Group has difficulties in fulfilling financial liabilities\nwhen they become due.\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash in order to meet the Group\u2019s\nfinancial obligations. The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring cash flow generated from\noperations and available borrowing capacity, and by managing the maturity profiles of its long-term\nloans.\nThe following is the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s financial liabilities based on contractual\nundiscounted payments:\nCapital risk management\nAt December 31, 2020\nIn thousands of USD\nWithin 1 \nyear or \non-\ndemand\nMore\nthan \n1 year\nbut \nless than\n2 years\nMore\nthan \n2 years\nbut \nless than \n5 years\nMore\nthan \n5 years\nTotal\nCarrying\namount \nat December\n31\nTrade payables\n3,062\n-\n-\n-\n3,062\n3,062\nOther payables and accruals\n6,953\n-\n-\n-\n6,953\n6,953\nAmounts due to related parties\n662,948\n-\n-\n-\n662,948\n662,948\nBorrowings\n-\n877\n-\n-\n877\n877\nLease liabilities\n5,771\n5,530\n12,407\n-\n23,708\n21,950\n678,734\n6,407\n12,407\n-\n697,548\n695,790\nF-80 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAt December 31, 2021\nIn thousands of USD\nWithin 1 \nyear or \non-\ndemand\nMore\nthan \n1 year\nbut \nless than\n2 years\nMore\nthan \n2 years\nbut \nless than \n5 years\nMore\nthan \n5 years\nTotal\nCarrying\namount \nat December\n31\nTrade payables\n17,740\n-\n-\n-\n17,740\n17,740\nOther payables and accruals\n17,258\n-\n-\n-\n17,258\n17,258\nAmounts due to related party\n19\n-\n-\n-\n19\n19\nBorrowings\n-\n29,460\n-\n-\n29,460\n29,460\nLease liabilities\n5,489\n5,516\n16,275\n53,254\n80,534\n62,968\n40,506\n34,976\n16,275\n53,254\n145,011\n127,445\nThe Group\u2019s objectives when managing capital are:\nTo safeguard the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for\nshareholders and benefits for other stakeholders\nTo support the Group\u2019s stability and growth\nTo provide capital for the purpose of strengthening the Group\u2019s risk management capability\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group reviews and manages its capital structure\nactively and regularly to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, taking into account the\nfuture capital requirements of the Group and capital efficiency, prevailing and projected profitability,\nprojected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment\nopportunities.\nFair value measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are estimated at a specific point\nin time, by discounting expected cash flows at rates for assets and liabilities of the same remaining maturities\nand conditions. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment,\nand therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the\nestimates.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial\ninstruments by valuation techniques:\nLevel 1 valuation: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2 valuation: inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 valuation: fair value measured using significant unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, substantially all of the Group\u2019s financial assets and financial\nliabilities are carried at amortized costs and the carrying amounts approximate their fair values. USDC is\nmeasured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the fair value of the\ncryptocurrencies lent or invested is measured on a recurring basis at quoted price at the time the fair value of\nthe underlying cryptocurrencies is being measured, which the Group considers to be a Level 1 fair value\ninput. The fair value of the embedded derivative relating to the wealth management product is measured on a\nrecurring basis by taking the net asset value provided by the counterparty, which the Group considers to be\na Level 2 fair value input.\nF-81 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBITDEER TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE COMBINED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5.
