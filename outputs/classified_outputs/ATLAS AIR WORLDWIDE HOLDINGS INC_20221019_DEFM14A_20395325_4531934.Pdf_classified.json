Broker non-\nvotes will not be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum\nunless your bank, broker or other nominee has been instructed to vote on at least one of the\nproposals presented in this proxy statement. If a quorum is not present or represented at the special\nmeeting of the Company stockholders, the Chairman of the Board or the stockholders entitled to vote\nthereat, present in person or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting, without notice, if the time\nand place of the new meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which Company\nstockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such adjourned meeting,\nare announced at the special meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If, however, the adjournment\nis for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned\nmeeting, we will provide a notice of the adjourned meeting to each Company stockholder of record\nentitled to vote at the special meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special\nmeeting, or if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special\nmeeting, we expect that the special meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional\nproxies.\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nThe approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of\nthe holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon.\nUnder Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the\nconsummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement proposal and\nvote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice versa.\nAbstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Company\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n21\nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nstockholder\u2019s behalf) and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe merger agreement proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by\nproxy) of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is\npresent at the special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to\nvote on a Company stockholder\u2019s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of\nthe advisory compensation proposal.\nThe approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of a\nmajority of the votes cast on such proposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present at\nthe special meeting, abstentions, failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a\nCompany stockholder\u2019s behalf) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the\nadjournment proposal. The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger\nagreement proposal is approved at the special meeting.\nA broker \u201cnon-vote\u201d occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner\ndoes not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power\nwith respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, but does\nhave discretionary voting power over other \u201croutine\u201d items and submits votes for those matters. The\nCompany does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting because the rules applicable\nto banks, brokers and other nominees only provide such organization with discretionary authority to\nvote on proposals that are considered \u201croutine\u201d, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the\nspecial meeting is considered \u201cnon-routine\u201d. As a result, no bank, broker or other nominee will be\npermitted to vote your shares of Company common stock at the special meeting without receiving\ninstructions.\nHow do the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers intend to vote?\nAs of October 18, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the\naggregate 325,199 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 1.1% of the outstanding\nshares of Company common stock as of October 18, 2022. Although none of the directors or\nexecutive officers is obligated to vote to approve the merger agreement proposal, we currently expect\nthat each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares \u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals to be\npresented at the special meeting.\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that\nare different from, or in addition to, my interests as a Company stockholder?\nIn considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting of Company stockholders, you\nshould be aware that the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the\nmerger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a Company stockholder. The\nmembers of the Board were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to\napprove and declare advisable the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and to recommend that Company\nstockholders approve the merger agreement proposal. These interests may include:\nthe treatment of Company long-term incentive awards provided for under the merger agreement (as\ndescribed below in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Company Long-Term Incentive\nAwards\u201d)\u037e\n22\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nseverance and other benefits payable in the case of certain qualifying terminations of employment\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nQ: \nA: \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nunder the terms of individual employment agreements or the Company\u2019s benefits program\u037e\nvesting and payment of account balances in the 401(k) Restoration Plan\u037e\nthe potential to receive an annual bonus for 2022 at the greater of target or actual performance\nlevels\u037e\nthe potential grant of cash-based retention awards under a program established for the benefit of\ncertain Company employees\u037e and\ncontinued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the organizational\ndocuments of the Company and its subsidiaries and indemnification agreements the Company and\nany of its subsidiaries has entered into with each of its directors and executive officers.\nThese interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section of this\nproxy statement entitled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Merger\u201d beginning on page 83.\nWhat will happen to outstanding Company long-term incentive awards in the merger?\nEach long-term incentive award outstanding as of August 4, 2022 shall be treated as follows:\neach Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled\nin exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the\nnumber of shares subject to such Company RSU\u037e\neach Company PSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be canceled\nin exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the merger consideration multiplied by the\nnumber of shares subject to such Company PSU, assuming the maximum level of achievement of\nany applicable Company PSU performance criteria (such performance criteria are currently\ntrending at or near the maximum level irrespective of the transaction)\u037e and\neach Company cash award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will vest and be\ncanceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the amount payable under the\napplicable award agreement assuming all relevant conditions were met and the maximum level of\nachievement of any applicable Company cash award performance criteria (such performance\ncriteria are currently trending at or near the maximum level irrespective of the transaction).\nWith respect to the awards described above, the payments described above will be made, subject to\nany applicable withholding taxes, as soon as practicable following the effective time (and in no event\nlater than the second regular payroll date following the effective time).\nWith respect to each post-signing cash award, such award will vest and be paid in equal annual\ninstallments over the three-year period from the applicable grant date, with such post-signing cash\naward vesting and being paid in equal annual installments over the three-year period from the\napplicable grant date, with accelerated vesting terms upon a qualifying termination of employment.\nSee \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTreatment of Company Long-Term Incentive Awards\u201d beginning on page\n96.\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n23\nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER\nWhat happens if I transfer my Company common stock before the special meeting?\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting.

Under the terms of\nthe merger agreement, subject to the satisfaction or (if permissible under applicable law) waiver of\nspecified conditions, MergerCo will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the\nmerger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board has unanimously approved and declared\nadvisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement and recommends that Company stockholders vote to adopt the merger\nagreement.\nBackground of the Merger\nAs part of their ongoing review of the Company\u2019s business, in concert with financial and legal advisors, the\nBoard and the Company\u2019s senior management team periodically review and evaluate the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and long-term strategy, competitive position, historical performance, future prospects and\nopportunities to increase stockholder value. These reviews have included discussions as to whether the\nCompany should continue to execute on its strategy as a stand-alone company, consider alternative\ncapital allocation approaches, pursue various acquisitions or pursue a sale of the Company. As part of\nthese reviews, the Board, together with Company management and with the assistance of the Company\u2019s\nadvisors, has considered from time to time potential alternatives to enhance stockholder value along with\nthe potential benefits and risks of any potential alternative.\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company received an unsolicited letter from Hill City, JFLCO and Apollo\n(collectively, the \u201cConsortium\u201d), which included a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash\nconsideration of $83.50 per share, subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation,\nexecution and delivery of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by\nthe Board and the Consortium\u2019s investment committees, approval of the transaction by Company\nstockholders and receipt of customary regulatory and other third-party approvals (the \u201cJune 1 Offer\u201d).

Representatives of Cravath reviewed\nwith the Board its fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the context of a review of a potential sale\ntransaction. The Board determined at the meeting that Timothy Bernlohr, a director who had disclosed to\nthe Board that he had a family connection to a principal of a member of the Consortium, could participate\nin discussions regarding strategic alternatives to the June 1 Offer but would recuse himself from\ndiscussions related to the Consortium and the June 1 Offer at the meeting and at subsequent Board\nmeetings. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board the key financial metrics underlying\nthe June 1 Offer, the Company\u2019s historical stock price performance and a preliminary illustrative financial\nanalysis of the Company, and Company management provided perspectives on the Company\u2019s recent\nperformance and outlook.

The Board determined at the\nmeeting that Mr. Dietrich should convey to the Consortium that the Company was not looking to pursue a\nsale, but that any formal acquisition proposal submitted by the Consortium would be reviewed by the\nBoard, and that the Board would not be likely to find any proposal of interest unless it presented\ncompelling stockholder value and a substantial premium to the Company\u2019s then all-time high closing\nshare price of $95.78, reached on January 4, 2022.\nFollowing the meeting of the Board on March 2, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz called Mr. Frazier to\nconvey the Board\u2019s message.\nLater on March 2, 2022, the Company received a proposal letter from the Consortium, which included a\nnon-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $98.00 per share, subject to\nsatisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually satisfactory\ndefinitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by the Board and the Consortium\u2019s investment\ncommittees, approval of the transaction by Company stockholders and receipt of customary regulatory\nand other third-party approvals (the \u201cMarch 2 Offer\u201d).

Company management then discussed with the\nBoard management\u2019s strategic plan, including the Base Management Case (as defined in \u201c- Certain\nFinancial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 62), key assumptions underlying the management strategic plan\nand key drivers of potential opportunities and risks going forward. Representatives from Morgan Stanley\nalso presented certain preliminary financial analyses of the Company based on the Base Management\nCase. Following discussion, the Board determined that Mr. Dietrich should convey to the Consortium: that\nthe Board was not looking to pursue a sale of the Company, but is always open to considering what may\nbe in the best interests of Company stockholders\u037e that the Board had carefully considered the March 2\nOffer and determined that it was not at a high enough value for the Company to engage with the\nConsortium regarding a potential transaction\u037e and that any proposal would have to be at a substantial\npremium to the Company\u2019s recent all-time high stock price of $95.78 to provide a basis for further\nengagement.\nOn March 18, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz had a call with Mr. Frazier, during which Mr. Dietrich\ncommunicated the Board\u2019s message and determinations, including that the Board had rejected the March\n2 Offer.\nOn March 23, 2022, the Company received a proposal letter from the Consortium, which included a non-\nbinding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $107.00 per share, subject to\nsatisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually satisfactory\ndefinitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by the Board and the Consortium\u2019s investment\ncommittees, approval of the transaction by Company stockholders and receipt of customary regulatory\nand other third-party approvals (the \u201cMarch 23 Offer\u201d).

Representatives from Morgan Stanley\nreviewed with the Board the March 23 Offer, including how the March 23 Offer compared to the prior offers\nreceived from the Consortium. The Board discussed with Company management and the representatives\nof Morgan Stanley and Cravath various potential ways in which the Company could respond to the March\n23 Offer. Following discussion, the Board determined that Mr. Dietrich should inform the Consortium that\nthe Board was not willing to consummate a transaction at the price proposed in the\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nMarch 23 Offer, but that the Board was willing to allow the Consortium to conduct limited due diligence to\nsee if it would be prepared to offer increased value, subject to the Consortium\u2019s agreement to a customary\nconfidentiality agreement (the \u201cConsortium NDA\u201d).\nOn April 1, 2022, Mr. Dietrich and Mr. Schwartz had a call with Mr. Frazier, during which Mr. Dietrich\ncommunicated the Board\u2019s message and determinations to Mr. Frazier and the parties discussed next\nsteps regarding due diligence and the proposed entry into the Consortium NDA.\nOn April 4, 2022, representatives of the Company provided the Consortium with a draft of the Consortium\nNDA. Between April 4 and April 12, the parties exchanged drafts of and negotiated the Consortium NDA.\nOn April 8, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance.

The Board also discussed the differences between the Seller\nCase and the Base Management Case (as described further in \u201c- Certain Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning\non page 62).\nOn April 12, 2022, the Company and funds affiliated with the members of the Consortium executed the\nConsortium NDA, which did not contain a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision and contained standstill\nprovisions that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition\nagreement with a third party.\nLater on April 12, 2022, representatives of the Company, with representatives of Morgan Stanley in\nattendance, held a management presentation for, and provided the Seller Case to, representatives of the\nConsortium and Evercore.\nBetween April 12 and late May 2022, the Company provided due diligence materials to the Consortium,\nincluding through a virtual data room containing initial due diligence materials, and representatives of\nCompany management and Morgan Stanley had numerous calls with representatives of the Consortium\nand Evercore regarding due diligence.\nOn May 3, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives of\nMorgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance. Company management and representatives of Morgan\nStanley reviewed with the Board the March 23 Offer, as well as the prior offers submitted by the\nConsortium. The Board discussed with its advisors trends in the U.S. equity and debt markets, and how\nthe Company\u2019s stock price, and the stock prices of its peers in the freight sector, had decreased since\nthe March 23 Offer was submitted. After discussing various alternative approaches to continuing\nengagement with the Consortium, the Board determined that it was in the best interest of the Company\nand Company stockholders to continue facilitating the Consortium\u2019s due diligence and to encourage the\nConsortium to submit an updated proposal after the Company\u2019s earnings call for the first quarter of 2022,\nscheduled for May 5, 2022.\nOn May 6, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of Evercore to request that\nthe Consortium submit a revised acquisition proposal representing its best offer.\nOn May 12, 2022, with the Company\u2019s permission and to facilitate the Consortium\u2019s transaction analysis\nand to avoid the risk of leaks, the Consortium had a discussion with a leveraged finance team at Morgan\n46\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nStanley regarding the condition of the financing markets, with the understanding that Morgan Stanley and\nits affiliates would not provide financing to the Consortium or any other potential buyers in a potential\nstrategic transaction with the Company.\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company received a proposal letter from the Consortium, which included a\nreaffirmed, non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for cash consideration of $107.00 per share,\nsubject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation, execution and delivery of mutually\nsatisfactory definitive agreements, approval of definitive agreements by the Board and the Consortium\u2019s\ninvestment committees, approval of the transaction by the Company stockholders and receipt of\ncustomary regulatory and other third-party approvals (the \u201cMay 19 Offer\u201d). As of the May 19 Offer, the U.S.\nequity and debt markets had experienced significant downturns since the Consortium had sent its letter\ncontaining the March 23 Offer. These downturns coincided with a period of rising interest rates and oil\nprices, increased inflation and geopolitical instability, resulting in a general decline in the stock prices of\nthe Company and its industry peers in the freight sector relative to earlier periods in the year. In its letter,\nthe Consortium noted that since the March 23 Offer had been communicated, macroeconomic conditions\nhad changed, and that the May 19 Offer, which maintained the $107.00 per share price despite such\nheadwinds, represented a significant increase in the premium offered per share as compared to the March\n23 Offer. The May 19 Offer represented a 54.8% premium to the Company common stock\u2019s closing share\nprice of $69.10 on May 18, 2022, and an 11.7% premium to its then all-time high closing share price of\n$95.78.\nOn May 24, 2022, Morgan Stanley provided to the Company a disclosure statement identifying prior and\ncurrent engagements and relationships between Morgan Stanley and affiliates of members of the\nConsortium.\nLater on May 24, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, to discuss, among other items, the May 19\nOffer. Company management and representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board the May 19\nOffer, along with current industry and macroeconomic trends, highlighting the deteriorating market\nconditions due to strong inflation, rising oil prices and the conflict in Ukraine, which was resulting in higher\ncosts of capital in the U.S. debt and equity markets. Representatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board\nits fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the context of a review of a potential sale transaction. The\nBoard discussed with Company management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Cravath\npotentially initiating an exploratory process involving outreach to additional potential counterparties to a\nstrategic transaction. In an executive session attended by only the Board, Company management and the\nrepresentatives of Cravath, the Board concluded, following discussion, that Mr. Dietrich and Company\nmanagement, together with the Company\u2019s advisors, should (i) continue to advance more fulsome due\ndiligence with the Consortium, while continuing to seek to obtain a higher price from the Consortium, and\n(ii) begin a process of soliciting proposals from a group of other potential acquirors, and to compare those\nproposals with that received from the Consortium and the Company\u2019s standalone outlook. The Board then\ndirected Company management to begin outreach to a list of potential strategic and financial\ncounterparties identified during the meeting.\nOn May 25, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley called representatives of Evercore to convey that,\nwhile the Board was disappointed that the May 19 Offer had not improved in absolute terms upon the\nMarch 23 Offer, the Company intended to continue working with the Consortium toward a potential\ntransaction, including by providing access to a virtual data room containing additional due diligence\nmaterials. The representatives of Morgan Stanley emphasized that the Board and Company management\ncontinued to believe that a higher price was appropriate.\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nBetween May 25 and May 29, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley reached out to a representative of\na strategic party that we refer to as \u201cParty A\u201d, a representative of a strategic party that we refer to as\n\u201cParty B\u201d, a representative of a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty C\u201d, a representative of a\nfinancial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty D\u201d, a representative of a financial sponsor that we refer to as\n\u201cParty E\u201d and a representative of a financial sponsor that we refer to as \u201cParty F\u201d, in each case on behalf\nof the Company and on a confidential basis to determine if such party would be interested in pursuing a\npotential strategic transaction with the Company.

Party F noted that the opportunity was\nnot the right fit for its company. Party C noted that it did not believe it would be able to offer a competitive\nvaluation.\nAlso on June 16, 2022, Party E delivered a letter to the Company that included a non-binding offer to\nacquire the Company for cash consideration of $100.00 per share, subject to satisfactory completion of\ndue diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement, and approval of the definitive agreement by Party\nE\u2019s investment committee (the \u201cParty E Offer\u201d).

The letter indicated that\nthe price per share was presented as a range due to Party I not having completed due diligence into the\nCompany\u2019s contracts and not having finalized the terms of its proposed financing. The letter also\nexpressed skepticism that Party I would be able to obtain the debt financing it required on terms it would\nfind acceptable.\nOn June 16 and June 17, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley held calls with representatives of each\nof Party E and Party I to discuss the Party E Offer and Party I Offer, respectively, including the factors\ndriving the valuation implied by the applicable offer. The representatives of Party E indicated to Morgan\nStanley that the $100.00 per share valuation included in the Party E Offer assumed a fully favorable due\ndiligence investigation based on forecasts presented by Company management and Party E\u2019s ability to\nobtain acceptable financing terms. The representatives of Party I indicated that the range included in the\nParty I Offer was contingent upon gaining greater visibility into the Company\u2019s contracted business,\nimprovement in the conditions in the financing markets and its ability to obtain acceptable financing\nterms, and that each of these components would need to turn out favorably to justify a price at the high\nend of such range.\nOn June 18, 2022, following receipt of the Party E Offer and the Party I Offer, pursuant to the Amazon\nStockholders Agreement, the Company sent notice to Amazon of its receipt of two acquisition proposals.\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nOn June 21, 2022, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with Company management and representatives\nof Morgan Stanley and Cravath in attendance, to discuss, among other items, updates related to the\nongoing bidding process, including the Party E Offer and the Party I Offer, and corresponding next steps.\nRepresentatives of Cravath reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties and other legal matters in the\ncontext of a review of a potential sale transaction.

Mr. Munfakh and Mr. Dietrich also discussed the timeline for the bidding process,\nand Mr. Munfakh indicated he expected the Consortium would be able to submit a draft merger agreement\nmark-up and final proposal on the timeline provided by the Company.\nOn July 13, 2022, representatives of Party I informed Morgan Stanley that Party I would not submit a final\nproposal to acquire the Company, citing that Party I had been unable to secure financing on acceptable\nterms given the current condition of the financing markets, and that it had been unable to substantiate\nvalue anywhere near the top end of the range provided in the Party I Offer. The representatives of Party I\ninquired as to whether the Company would be willing to delay its timeline for entering into a potential\ntransaction to allow the conditions of the financing market to improve, but the representatives of Morgan\nStanley responded, on behalf of the Board, that the Company was seeking to conclude the process prior\nto its earnings release for the second quarter of 2022, scheduled for early August.\nOn July 18, 2022, representatives of Party E had informed Morgan Stanley that Party E would not submit\na final proposal to acquire the Company, citing the condition of the financing markets and that it was\nunable to substantiate additional value beyond the $100.00 per share amount set forth in the Party E\nOffer.\nAlso on July 18, 2022, the Company issued a press release setting August 5, 2022 as the date of its\nearnings call for the second quarter of 2022.\nOn July 19, 2022, representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), the\nConsortium\u2019s legal advisor, sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of Cravath on\nbehalf of the Consortium.

The\nBoard determined that it would continue to engage with the Consortium in advance of receipt of its final\nacquisition proposal the following week.\nOn July 22, 2022, Company management held a call with representatives of the Consortium to discuss\nthe Company\u2019s results for the second quarter of 2022, scheduled to be announced on August 5, 2022, and\nthe updated forecast for the remaining quarters of 2022, which information was also provided to the\nConsortium as part of its due diligence.\nOn July 22, 2022, representatives of Cravath held a call with representatives of Paul Weiss to discuss the\nrevised draft of the merger agreement received from Paul Weiss on July 19, 2022.\nLater on July 22, 2022, representatives of Cravath sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Paul Weiss on behalf of the Company.

The Consortium further noted in its letter that it had completed its due\ndiligence. In advance of delivering the letter, Mr. Munfakh called Mr. Dietrich to preview the updated bid\nand explained the decreased bid price relative to the Consortium\u2019s prior bid price was a result of the\nConsortium\u2019s increased costs and potential inability to obtain acceptable financing terms to the extent\nrequired to maintain its previously offered price per share, as well as the Company\u2019s actual results for the\nsecond quarter of 2022 and forecast for the remaining quarters of 2022 previously made available to the\nConsortium. The July 29 Offer represented a 38.0% premium to the Company common stock\u2019s closing\nshare price of $73.19 on July 28, 2022, and a 5.4% premium to its then all-time high closing share price of\n$95.78.\nAlso in the morning on July 29, 2022, representatives of Paul Weiss sent a revised draft of the merger\nagreement to representatives of Cravath on behalf of the Consortium.

Board. The Board unanimously reached the\nconclusion to (i) determine and declare that it is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the\nCompany and Company stockholders, that the Company enter into the merger agreement and\nconsummate the transactions, (ii) approve and declare the advisability of the merger agreement and the\nconsummation of the transactions, including the merger, (iii) recommend that the Company stockholders\nentitled to vote adopt the merger agreement and (iv) direct that the merger agreement be submitted to the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders entitled to vote for adoption in light of the factors described above and other\nfactors that the Board believed were appropriate.

In considering the factors discussed above,\nindividual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors.\nThis explanation of the Board\u2019s reasons for its recommendations and other information presented in this\nsection is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d\nbeginning on page 28.\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n61\n",

However, the Company has included in this proxy statement certain financial forecasts of the\nCompany that, to the extent described herein, were furnished to (i) the Board, the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisor and the Consortium, in connection with the discussions concerning the proposed merger and (ii)\ncertain other parties potentially interested in a transaction with the Company.\nThese Financial Forecasts (as defined below) were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or\nwith a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial data, published guidelines of the\nSEC regarding forward-looking statements or generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates (\u201cGAAP\u201d). A summary of this information is presented below.\nNo assurances can be made regarding future events and the estimates and assumptions underlying these\nfinancial forecasts involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive,\nregulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that\nare inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and\ncontingencies, including, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the business and economic\nconditions affecting the industries in which the Company operates, and the risk and uncertainties\ndescribed under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 28, all\nof which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside the control of the Company and, upon\nconsummation of the merger, will be beyond the control of the Consortium and the surviving corporation.\nCompany stockholders are urged to review the Company\u2019s SEC filings for a description of risk factors with\nrespect to the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions will\nprove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized. Actual results likely will differ, and may\ndiffer materially, from those reflected in the Financial Forecasts, whether or not the merger is\nconsummated. The inclusion in this proxy statement of the Financial Forecasts below should not be\nregarded as an indication that the Company, the Consortium, their respective boards of directors (or\nequivalent governing bodies) or their respective financial advisors considered, or now consider, these\nforecasts to be a reliable predictor of future results. The Financial Forecasts are not fact, and neither they\nnor any underlying assumptions should be relied upon as being indicative of future results. Readers of this\nproxy statement are cautioned not to place reliance on this information. The Financial Forecasts assume\nthat the Company would continue to operate as a standalone company and do not reflect any impact of\nthe merger, except as described below for the Seller Case.\nInvestors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement are\nnot prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the\namounts associated with the Company\u2019s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement\nhave no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to\ninvestors.

The footnotes to the tables below provide\ncertain supplemental information with respect to the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Financial Forecasts included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of,\nthe Company\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent auditor has not audited,\nreviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the accompanying\nFinancial Forecasts and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any\nother form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by\nreference in this document relates to the Company\u2019s previously issued financial statements. It does not\nextend to the Financial Forecasts and should not be read to do so.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts that were approved by the\nCompany for use by Morgan Stanley (consisting of the Updated Management Case and the Company\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow (as defined below)) were relied upon by Morgan Stanley for its financial\nanalysis in connection with the preparation of its opinion and by the Board for its consideration of the\nmerger. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor in connection with a business combination\ntransaction are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures. In\naddition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Board or Morgan\nStanley in connection with their respective evaluations of the merger. Accordingly, the Company has not\nprovided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the Financial Forecasts to the\nrelevant GAAP financial measures.\nBy including in this proxy statement the Financial Forecasts below, none of the Company or the\nConsortium members or any of their respective representatives has made or makes any representation to\nany person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in\nthe Financial Forecasts.

The Seller Case reflected certain\nassumptions with respect to yields, crew costs, crew availability and operating as a private entity.\nIn addition, in connection with the Company\u2019s evaluation of a proposed transaction in July 2022, the\nCompany\u2019s management updated the Base Management Case (which we refer to as the \u201cUpdated\nManagement Case\u201d) to reflect (i) the actual results for the second quarter of 2022 and (ii) an updated\nforecast for the remaining quarters of 2022 and for fiscal years 2023 through 2026, which updated forecast\ntook into account certain adjustments relating to, among other things, the developments with respect to\nyields, crew costs, crew availability, fuel costs (which generally impact revenue but do not result in\nmaterial changes to EBITDAR) and the Company and its subsidiaries entering into new customer\nagreements.

with, the limited guarantees, merger agreement, the equity\ncommitment letters or any other document or instrument delivered in connection with the limited\nguarantees and the transactions contemplated by the foregoing documents or instruments.\nAppraisal Rights\nIf the merger is consummated, persons who do not wish to accept the merger consideration are entitled to\nseek appraisal of their shares of Company common stock under Section 262 and, if all procedures\ndescribed in Section 262 are strictly complied with, to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their\nshares of Company common stock exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid\nupon the amount determined to be the fair value. The \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of Company common\nstock as determined by the Delaware Court may be more or less than, or the same as, the merger\nconsideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the merger agreement. These rights are\nknown as \u201cappraisal rights\u201d. This proxy statement serves as a notice of such appraisal rights pursuant to\nSection 262.\nPersons who exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 will not receive the merger\nconsideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement.\nThey will receive an amount determined to be the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Company\ncommon stock following petition to, and an appraisal by, the Delaware Court. Persons\nconsidering seeking appraisal should recognize that the fair value of their shares of Company\ncommon stock determined under Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the\nmerger consideration they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the merger\nagreement. Strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 262 is required. Failure to\ncomply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the withdrawal,\nloss or waiver of appraisal rights. Consequently, and in view of the complexity of the provisions\nof Section 262, persons wishing to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and\nfinancial advisors before attempting to exercise such rights.\nA copy of Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following publicly available\nwebsite: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. The following summary is not a\ncomplete statement of the law relating to appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nSection 262 and any amendments thereto after the date of this proxy statement. Any person who desires\nto exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 and is urged to consult his,\nher or its legal and financial advisors before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The following\nsummary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that persons\nseek to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal\nrights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration under the merger agreement.\nA holder of record or a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock who (i) continuously holds\nsuch shares through the effective time, (ii) has not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the merger\nor otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights, (iii) strictly complies with the procedures under\nSection 262, (iv) does not thereafter withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal of such shares and (v) in\nthe case of a beneficial owner, a person who (A) reasonably identifies in his, her or its demand the holder\nof record of the shares for which the demand is made, (B) provides documentary evidence of such\nbeneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and\ncorrect copy of what it purports to be and (C) provides an address at which such beneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by the Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List (as defined\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n79\nAttention: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nbelow), will be entitled to receive the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company common stock\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as\ndetermined by the Delaware Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined\nto be the fair value.\nSection 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of\nstockholders, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be available not less than twenty (20)\ndays before the meeting to vote on the merger. Such notice must include either a copy of Section 262 or\ninformation directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may\nbe accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to our\nstockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, in compliance with the\nrequirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully\nreview the text of Section 262, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the following\npublicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. Failure to\ncomply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal\nrights under the DGCL.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Company common stock, you must satisfy each of the\nfollowing conditions: you must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of\nCompany common stock before the taking of the vote on the merger, which demand must reasonably\ninform us of the identity of the holder of record of shares of Company common stock who intends to\ndemand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company common stock and, for beneficial owners only,\nsuch demand must be accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial\nownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports\nto be, and must provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by\nthe Company and to be set forth on the Chancery List\u037e you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the\nproposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e you must hold your shares of Company common stock\ncontinuously through the effective time\u037e and you must comply with the other applicable requirements of\nSection 262.\nA Company stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights must mail his, her or its written demand\nfor appraisal to the following address:\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. \n2000 Westchester Avenue \nPurchase, NY 10577\nAdam R. Kokas, Esq. \nEVP, General Counsel & Secretary\nA record holder who holds shares of Company common stock as a nominee for others, such as a broker,\nfiduciary, depositary or other nominee, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for all\nor less than all beneficial owners of shares as to which such person is the record owner. In such case, the\ndemand must set forth the number of shares of Company common stock covered by such demand.\nWhere the number of shares of Company common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be\npresumed to cover all shares of Company common stock outstanding in the name of such record owner.\nWithin ten (10) days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the\nmerger has become effective to each of (i) each Company stockholder who has properly filed a written\ndemand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and\n80\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\n(ii) any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under Section 262. At any time within sixty (60)\ndays after the effective time, any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a\nproceeding as a named party may withdraw the demand and accept the merger consideration specified by\nthe merger agreement for that person\u2019s shares of Company common stock by delivering to the surviving\ncorporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation\nand any person who has properly and timely demanded appraisal and otherwise complied with Section\n262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served\non the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a person, demanding a determination of the\nfair value of the shares of Company common stock held by all persons that have demanded appraisal.\nThere is no present intent on the part of the Company or the surviving corporation to file an appraisal\npetition and persons seeking to exercise appraisal rights should assume that the Company and the\nsurviving corporation will not file such a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nshares of Company common stock. Accordingly, persons who desire to have their shares of Company\ncommon stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights\nwithin the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If, within one hundred twenty (120)\ndays after the effective time, no petition has been filed as provided above, all rights to appraisal will cease\nand any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the merger consideration\nunder the merger agreement.\nIn addition, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, any person who has theretofore\ncomplied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive\nfrom the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Company\ncommon stock not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal were\nreceived by the surviving corporation and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement\nmust be given within ten (10) days after the written request therefor has been received by the surviving\ncorporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as\ndescribed above, whichever is later.\nUpon the filing of a petition by a person, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the\nsurviving corporation. The surviving corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such\nservice, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of\nCompany common stock and with whom the surviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the\nvalue of such shares (the \u201cChancery List\u201d). The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court,\nshall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail\nto the surviving corporation and to all such persons set forth on the Chancery List.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a person, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court\nwill determine which persons have complied with Section 262 and have become entitled to appraisal rights\nprovided thereby. The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their\nshares of Company common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their\ncertificates of shares of Company common stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any person fails to comply with such direction, the\nDelaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before the merger, the\nshares of the class or series of stock of the corporation were listed on a national securities exchange, the\nDelaware Court will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n81\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\noutstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided\nin the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceedings, the Delaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the persons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List\nmay participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to\nappraisal rights under Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with\nthe rules of the Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through\nsuch proceedings the Delaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of Company common stock\ntaking into account all relevant factors, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment\nor expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be\nthe fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time through the date\nthe judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge)\nas established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of\nthe judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may\npay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such\npayment only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the\nshares of Company common stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (ii) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid by the surviving corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.\nWhen the fair value of the shares of Company common stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct\nthe payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the\noutcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize\nthat such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nmerger consideration. Moreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the\nmerger consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant shares of Company\ncommon stock is less than the merger consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving\nthe value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair\nvalue, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts which were known or could be ascertained as of the date of the merger\nwhich throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is\nto be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In\nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value\u201d, but which rather applies only to the\nspeculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.\n82\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n",

However, costs do not include\nattorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 and expert\nwitness fees, although, upon application of a person whose name appears on the Chancery List who\nparticipated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court may\norder that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert\nwitness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of Company common stock entitled to\nappraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to\na reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware Court are\nsubject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote\nfor any purpose any shares of Company common stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of\ndividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to Company\nstockholders of record at a date prior to the effective time.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval\nof the Delaware Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court\ndeems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court made\nunder Section 262(j) of the DGCL\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any\nperson who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party\nto withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within\nsixty (60) days after the effective time. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within\none hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, all rights to appraisal will cease and any person\nthat previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the merger consideration under the\nmerger agreement.\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and\nSection 262, on the other hand, Section 262 will govern.\nInterests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different\nfrom, or in addition to, the interests of the Company stockholders generally.

The Company stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-\nbinding, advisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory\nonly, it will not be binding on either the Company, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger\nagreement proposal is approved by the Company stockholders and the merger is consummated, the\ncompensation will be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation,\nsubject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below\nand above under \u201c- Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-\nK.

As such, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may\nor may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect\ncertain compensation actions that may occur before the consummation of the merger.

It is not intended to be a\ncomplete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and\ndoes not address consequences to holders of Company long-term incentive awards or Company\nWarrants. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code and all of which are subject to change\nor varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of\nthe statements and conclusions set forth herein. The Internal Revenue Service may not agree with the tax\nconsequences described in this discussion.\nThis discussion assumes that holders of Company common stock hold their shares as capital assets\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion\ndoes not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Company\ncommon stock in light of such holder\u2019s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss the special\nconsiderations applicable to holders of Common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal\nincome tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, partnerships\nor other pass-through entities and their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations, retirement or\nother tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, dealers in securities or non-U.S. currencies, traders in\nsecurities who elect mark-to-market method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign\ninvestment companies, U.S. expatriates, holders who acquired their shares of Company common stock\nthrough vesting of units or otherwise as compensation, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax,\nholders who hold their shares of Company common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale\nor conversion transaction, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S.\ndollar, accrual method holders who prepare an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d  (as defined in Section 451\nof the Code) and holders who own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of the\nCompany common stock (by vote or value) outstanding. In addition, this discussion does not address any\ntax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction or U.S. federal non-\nincome tax consequences (e.g., the federal estate or gift tax or the application of the Medicare tax on net\ninvestment income under Section 1411 of the Code).\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common\nstock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner\n88\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n(4)\n(5)\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nand activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding common stock, you should\nconsult your own tax advisor.\nAll holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to\nthem (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax\nlaws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the\nmerger.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of common stock, that\nis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia\u037e\na trust if (1) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States\nand one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the\nauthority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in effect under\napplicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes\u037e or\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nA \u201cnon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity classified as a partnership\nthat is subject to U.S. federal income tax reporting) of Company common stock that is not a U.S. holder.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal\nto the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and such U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Company common stock converted into cash pursuant to the\nmerger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nthe holder\u2019s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term\ncapital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for a\nreduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If\na U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Company common stock at different times or at different prices,\nsuch U.S. holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to\neach block of common stock.\nA U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup\nwithholding (at a rate of 24%) with respect to the cash received pursuant to the merger, unless such\nholder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise\ncomplies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an\nadditional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited\nagainst a U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any\u037e provided that such U.S. holder furnishes\nthe required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n89\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not\nbe subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\nthe gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required\nby an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a permanent establishment or, in the case of\nan individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case\nthe non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder\nand, if the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, such corporation may be subject to branch\nprofits tax at the rate of 30% on the effectively connected gain (or such lower rate as may be specified\nby an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days\nor more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-\nU.S. holder generally will be subject to tax at a 30% rate (or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate)\non any gain derived from the disposition of the Company common stock pursuant to the merger (other\nthan gain effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business), which may be offset by U.S. source\ncapital losses\u037e or\nthe Company stock constitutes a \u201cUnited States real property interest\u201d  (\u201cUSRPI\u201d) for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d).\nIf our shares of Company common stock constitute a USRPI under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. holder would be\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain or loss recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for\nsuch shares of Company common stock in the merger on a net basis at applicable U.S. graduated rates\nin the same manner as a U.S. holder, and such cash consideration may also be subject to the U.S.\nfederal withholding tax under FIRPTA at a rate of 15%.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nTHE MERGER\nLitigation Related to the Merger\nOn October 7, 2022, a complaint, captioned Stein v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No.\n1:22-cv-08555, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by\nplaintiff Shiva Stein, a purported Company stockholder (the \u201cStein complaint\u201d), and on October 14, 2022, a\ncomplaint, captioned Okin v. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08778, was filed\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by plaintiff Alexander Okin, a\npurported Company stockholder, in each case naming as defendants the Company and members of the\nBoard. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants caused to be filed a materially\nincomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC relating to the\nmerger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated\nthereunder.\nAmong other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the\nmerger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly\nomitted from the preliminary proxy statement, rescinding the merger agreement or any of the terms\nthereof to the extent already implemented or granting rescissory damages, awarding the plaintiff the costs\nand disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert fees and expenses, and\ngranting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Stein complaint\nadditionally seeks an order directing the defendants to account to the plaintiff for all damages suffered as\na result of the alleged wrongdoing.\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company also received a demand letter from a purported Company stockholder\nalleging disclosure deficiencies in the preliminary proxy statement and demanding that the Company and\nthe Board promptly issue corrective disclosures to cure the proxy statement prior to the anticipated\nstockholder vote on the merger.\nThe Company has not yet formally responded to the complaints or to the demand, but believes that the\nallegations contained therein are without merit and that no further disclosure is required to supplement the\nproxy statement under applicable laws. As of October 18, 2022, the Company was not aware of the filing\nof other lawsuits challenging the merger or the proxy statement\u037e however, such lawsuits may be filed in\nthe future.\nRegulatory Approvals in Connection with the Merger\nThe parties to the merger agreement intend to, and are obligated to, cooperate with each other and use\ntheir respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, amongst other things,\n(i) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, exemptions, clearances,\norders and other confirmations from any governmental authority or third-party necessary, proper or\nadvisable to consummate the transactions and (ii) defend or contest in good faith any action or judgment\nthat could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the\nconsummation of the transactions, in each case, as described in the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement - Reasonable Best Efforts\u201d. The management of each of the Company\nand Parent currently believe that the necessary regulatory approvals can be obtained in the fourth quarter\nof 2022 or the first quarter of 2023\u037e however, there can be no assurances that such approvals will be\nobtained in accordance with this timing or at all.\nHSR Act Clearance\nConsummation of the merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act and the rules promulgated by\nthe FTC, which prevent transactions such as the merger from being consummated until (i) certain\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n91TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTHE MERGER\ninformation and materials are furnished to the DOJ and the FTC and (ii) the applicable waiting period is\nterminated early or expires. The FTC and DOJ have currently suspended the practice of granting early\ntermination under the HSR Act. Both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and\nReport Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on August 12, 2022. On September 12,\n2022, Parent withdrew its filing and refiled on September 14, 2022 in order to provide the FTC and the\nAntitrust Division of the DOJ with an additional 30-day period to review the filings. The waiting period\napplicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act expired on October 14, 2022.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of\nthe waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws\nas it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the\nmerger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold\nseparate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the\ncompletion of the merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems\nnecessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion\nof the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to\ntake legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a\nchallenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther U.S. Regulatory Approvals\nConsummation of the merger is also subject to receipt of certain additional consents, approvals or other\nclearances (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties, if permissible under\napplicable law), consisting of receipt of approvals from the DOT and the FCC.\nThere can be no assurance that the requisite approvals will be obtained on a timely basis or at all.\nNon-U.S. Regulatory Approvals\nConsummation of the merger is also subject to receipt of certain additional consents, approvals or other\nclearances (unless excluded by waiver mutually agreed between the parties, if permissible under\napplicable law), consisting of receipt of a clearance decision by (i) the European Union pursuant to\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 for Europe, (ii) the People\u2019s Republic of China pursuant to the Anti-\nmonopoly Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, (iii) the Republic of Korea pursuant to The Monopoly\nRegulation and Fair Trade Act for Korea and (iv) Japan pursuant to The Antimonopoly Act for Japan. The\nparties made the required filings with the European Union on September 13, 2022, the People\u2019s Republic\nof China on September 16, 2022, the Republic of Korea on September 26, 2022 and Japan on September\n30, 2022. Antitrust clearance in the People\u2019s Republic of China was received on October 13, 2022.\nIn each case, the relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory\nlaws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the\nparties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and\ncontractual rights. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a\nchallenge is made, we will prevail.\nAdditional Approvals\nIn addition, the parties expect to submit a notice of the transactions to the U.S. Defense\nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (the \u201cDCSA\u201d).\nThe Company and Parent also intend to make all required filings under the Exchange Act relating to the\nmerger and obtain all other approvals and consents that may be necessary to give effect to the merger.\n92\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. 2022 Notice & Proxy Statement\n",
