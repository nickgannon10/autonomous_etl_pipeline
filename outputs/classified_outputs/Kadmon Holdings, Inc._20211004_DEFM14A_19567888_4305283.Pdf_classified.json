In the event it is not possible or advisable to hold the Special\nMeeting in person, we will announce by issuance of a press release alternative arrangements for the meeting as\npromptly as practicable, which may include holding the Special Meeting solely by means of remote communication.\nIn person attendance at the Special Meeting will be subject to applicable health and safety restrictions relating to\nCOVID-19, and as a result, stockholders are encouraged to vote by submitting a proxy by telephone, over the\nInternet, by returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.\nAt the Special Meeting, holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock will be asked to:\n1.\nconsider and vote upon the proposal (the \u201cMerger Proposal\u201d) to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve\nthe Merger, as more fully described in this proxy statement and under \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement\u201d beginning on page 74\u037e and\n2.\nconsider and vote upon the proposal (the \u201cAdjournment Proposal\u201d) to adjourn the Special Meeting, if\nnecessary and for a minimum period of time reasonable under the circumstances, to ensure that any\nnecessary supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to Company stockholders a\nreasonable amount of time in advance of the Special Meeting, or to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, as more fully\ndescribed in this proxy statement and under \u201cProposal 2: Adjournment of the Special Meeting\u201d beginning\non page 75.\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nRecord Date and Quorum\nYou are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting if you owned shares of Common Stock\nand/or Preferred Stock at the close of business on September 27, 2021, which the Company has set as the record date\nfor the Special Meeting (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d). You will have one vote for each share of Common Stock that you owned\non the Record Date and approximately 134 votes for each share of Preferred Stock that you owned as of the Record\nDate. As of the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 shares of Common Stock and 28,708 shares of Preferred Stock\n(which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights equivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of Common\nStock) outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or\nrepresented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting power of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued\nand outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of business\nat the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as described below) are counted as present for the\npurpose of determining whether a quorum is present.\nVote Required\nApproval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares\nof Common Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) entitled\nto vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the\nMerger Proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock) present in\nperson or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is\npresent. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against approval of this proposal. Broker non-votes are not\ncounted for purposes of this proposal.\nLitigation Related to the Merger\nOn October 1 and 4, 2021, two alleged stockholders of the Company filed actions in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York against the Company and the members of its Board of Directors under the following\ncaptions: (i) Nancy Jaser v. Kadmon Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08154 (S.D.N.Y.) (the \u201cJaser Action\u201d)\u037e (ii) John\nDillon v. Kadmon Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-08169 (S.D.N.Y.) (the \u201cDillon Action,\u201d and collectively, the\n\u201cActions\u201d). The Actions assert claims solely on behalf of the individual stockholders and generally allege that the\nCompany and its Board of Directors failed to disclose allegedly material information in the proxy statement. The\nActions seek an order enjoining the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and\nawarding damages. We believe that the claims asserted in the Actions are without merit. Additional lawsuits arising\nout of the Merger Agreement may be filed in the future. If additional similar lawsuits are filed, absent new or different\nallegations that are material, the Company will not necessarily announce such additional filings.\nProxies and Revocation\nAny stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet,\nby returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or may vote in person by\nappearing at the Special Meeting.

If you fail to\nsubmit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, or do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other\nnominee with instructions, as applicable, your shares of Common Stock will not be voted on the Merger Proposal,\nwhich will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Merger Proposal, and your shares of Common Stock\nwill not have an effect on the Adjournment Proposal.\nYou have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before\nit is exercised, by voting again at a later date through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of\nrevocation to our Secretary or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person.\n2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe Merger\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge\nwith and into the Company.

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened\nbreaches) of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.\nMarket Price of Common Stock\nThe closing price of Common Stock on NASDAQ on September 7, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public\nannouncement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, was $5.30 per share of Common Stock. On October 1, 2021,\nthe most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for\nCommon Stock on NASDAQ was $8.87 per share of Common Stock. You are encouraged to obtain current market\nquotations for Common Stock in connection with voting your shares of Common Stock.\nAppraisal Rights\nStockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the General Corporation Law of the state of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d)\nin connection with the Merger. This means that you are entitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common\nStock and/or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that\nvaluation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL. The\nultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you\nwould have received under the Merger Agreement.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is\ntaken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote, either in person or by proxy, in favor of the Merger Proposal.\nYour failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights.\nSee \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights statute reproduced in its\nentirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common Stock through a bank, brokerage\nfirm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or\nother nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by your bank,\nbrokerage firm or other nominee. In view of the complexity of the DGCL, stockholders who wish to pursue appraisal\nrights should consult their legal and financial advisors promptly.\nDelisting and Deregistration of Common Stock\nIf the Merger is completed, the Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange\nAct, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\n9\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

If the\nMerger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger\nAgreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company\nbecoming a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Sanofi. As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be\na public company and you will cease to hold Common Stock or Preferred Stock or have any interest in the\nCompany\u2019s future earnings or growth. In addition, following the Merger, the Common Stock will be delisted from\nNASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ.\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nA.\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration,\nwithout interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Common Stock that you own\nand/or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, less any applicable tax withholding, for each\nshare of Preferred Stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal\nrights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of Common Stock, you\nwill receive $950 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, in exchange for your shares. Following\ncompletion of the Merger, you will not own any shares of the capital stock in Sanofi or the Surviving\nCorporation. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy.\nQ.\nHow does the Common Stock Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Common Stock prior to\nannouncement of the Merger?\nA.\nThe Common Stock Merger Consideration represents a premium of 79% over the closing price on September 7,\n2021 and a premium of approximately 113% over the volume weighted average price for the 60 trading days prior\nto such date.\nQ.\nHow does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?\nA.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that our stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d approval of the Merger Proposal and\n\u201cFOR\u201d approval of the Adjournment Proposal.\n10TABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ.\nWhen do you expect the Merger to be completed?\nA.\nWe are working toward completing the Merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely receipt of required\nregulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders of the\nMerger Proposal, we expect the Merger to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, we cannot\nassure completion by any particular date, if at all.\nQ.\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA.\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the stockholders of the Company or if the Merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, you will continue to hold your shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock and you\nwill not receive any payment for such shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an\nindependent public company, and the Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. Under\nspecified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Sanofi a fee with respect to the termination of\nthe Merger Agreement as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\nQ.\nWhat conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger?\nA.\nThe respective obligations of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to\nthe satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by\nour stockholders, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the absence of any legal prohibitions, the accuracy of\nthe representations and warranties of the parties, compliance by the parties with their respective obligations\nunder the Merger Agreement and the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).\nFor a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the\nMerger, see \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to Completion of the Merger\u201d and \u201cThe Merger-Regulatory\nApprovals\u201d.\nQ.\nIs the Merger expected to be taxable to me?\nA.\nThe exchange of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable\ntransaction to U.S. holders (as defined in \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the\nMerger\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder and you exchange your shares of\nCommon Stock or Preferred Stock in the Merger for cash, you will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares, including any applicable\nwithholding taxes, and your adjusted tax basis in such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. Backup\nwithholding may also apply to the cash received by a non-corporate U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger unless\nsuch U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct and that is not\nsubject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You\nshould read \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d for a more detailed\ndiscussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You should also consult your tax advisor\nfor a complete analysis of the effect of the Merger on your federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.\nQ:\nWhat will holders of Company equity-based awards receive in the Merger?\nA:\nAs a result of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Merger:\n\u2022\nWithout any action on the part of any holder of Company Options (i) all unvested Company Options which\nare outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will fully vest and become exercisable Company\nOptions, and (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option will be\ncanceled at the Effective Time, with the former holder of such canceled Company Option becoming entitled\nto receive an amount in cash equal to the Company Option Merger Consideration.

As a result, if you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the Special Meeting,\nor abstain, or you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with instructions, as applicable,\nthis will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Proposal.\nAs of close of business on the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 outstanding shares of Common Stock and\n28,708 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights\nequivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of common stock as of the Record Date).\nQ.\nWhat vote of stockholders is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?\nA.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock (voting on an as-converted basis with the holders of Common Stock)\npresent in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, whether or\nnot a quorum is present.\nAbstaining will have the same effect as a vote against the Adjournment Proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy or\nto vote in person at the Special Meeting or if your shares of Common Stock are held through a bank, brokerage\nfirm or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of\nCommon Stock, your shares of Common Stock will not be voted, but this will not have an effect on the\nAdjournment Proposal.\nQ.\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from or be in\naddition to my interests as a stockholder?\nA.\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors, you should be aware that our directors and\nexecutive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, yours.

For more\ninformation see \u201cThe Merger-Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ.\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA.\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. In this case, we have\nsent this proxy statement and your proxy card to you directly. As the stockholder of record, you have the right\nto vote, grant your voting directly to the Company or to a third party or to vote in person at the meeting.\nIf your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of\nshares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d and your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is considered the stockholder of\nrecord with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,\nbrokerage firm or other nominee. You should follow the instructions provided by them to vote your shares. You\nare invited to attend the Special Meeting\u037e however, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting\nunless you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares,\ngiving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.\nQ.\nIf my shares of Common Stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will\nmy bank, brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares of Common Stock for me?\nA.\nYour bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares if you instruct your bank,\nbrokerage firm or other nominee how to vote.

Under the rules of NASDAQ, banks,\nbrokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in street name for customers have the authority to vote on\n\u201croutine\u201d proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks,\nbrokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to\napproving non-routine matters, such as the Merger Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from\nthe beneficial owner of such shares, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those\nshares on non-routine matters. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your\nshares of Common Stock, your shares will not be voted (\u201cbroker non-votes\u201d) and the effect will be the same as a\nvote against approval of the Merger Proposal, and your shares will not have an effect on the Adjournment\nProposal.\nQ.\nWho can vote at the Special Meeting?\nA.\nAll holders of record of Common Stock and Preferred Stock as of the close of business on September 27, 2021,\nthe Record Date, are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.\nQ.\nHow many votes do I have?\nA.\nOn each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting, you are entitled to one vote for each share of\nCommon Stock and approximately 134 votes for each share of Preferred Stock held of record as of the Record\nDate. As of close of business on the Record Date, there were 176,242,263 outstanding shares of Common Stock\nand 28,708 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (which, on an as-converted basis, represents voting rights\nequivalent to approximately 3,851,031 shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date).\nQ.\nWhat is a quorum?\nA.\nThe presence at the Special Meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority in voting\npower of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote are present in\nperson or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of\nbusiness at the Special Meeting.

As a holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the\nDGCL in connection with the Merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions, including that you\ndo not vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.

For the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, please see Annex B hereto.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ.\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA.\nThe SEC permits companies to send a single set of certain disclosure documents to any household at which two\nor more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides\nadvance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate\nnotice of the meeting and proxy card.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe following chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Board of Directors,\nmembers of Company management or the representatives of the Company and other parties.\nThe Board of Directors, with the Company\u2019s senior management, regularly reviews the Company\u2019s business,\noperations, financial performance and strategic direction for the purpose of increasing stockholder value. As part of\nthis on-going review, the Board of Directors considers the Company\u2019s long-term strategies and plans, changes in the\nindustry and markets in which the Company operates, execution opportunities and risks, potential strategic\ntransaction opportunities, including partnership and collaboration opportunities and financial alternatives in light of\ndevelopments of the Company\u2019s clinical and commercial stage products. As part of this process, Company\nmanagement regularly engages in business development and strategic discussions with various participants in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company issued 3.625% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) in the\naggregate principal amount of $240 million, the proceeds of which the Company anticipated would enable it to\nadvance its planned commercial launch efforts for belumosudil and advance certain of its other pipeline product\ncandidates, including KD033, part of the Company\u2019s immuno-oncology platform.\nOn June 26, 2021, Matthieu Merlin, Head of Business Development and Licensing (General Medicines Business Unit)\nof Sanofi, reached out to a representative of the Company to set up an introductory meeting to explore potential\nopportunities for collaboration between the two companies. At the time of Sanofi\u2019s outreach, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) was reviewing the New Drug Application for belumosudil, the Company\u2019s lead product\ncandidate, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 30, 2021. Other of the Company\u2019s\nproduct candidates remain in different stages of clinical and preclinical development.\nThe Company has from time to time utilized the services of Moelis and Cantor Fitzgerald for investment banking and\nother financial services unrelated to the Merger, including Cantor Fitzgerald acting as sole bookrunner\n23TABLE OF CONTENTS\nin connection with the Company\u2019s issuance of the Convertible Notes in February 2021, acting as the placement agent\nfor the Company\u2019s ongoing at-the-market offering program, executing two block trades on behalf of the Company in\nOctober 2019 and May 2020 and acting as the joint bookrunner for the Company\u2019s public offering of Common Stock\nin November 2019.\nOn June 16, 2021, a representative from a potential strategic bidder for the Company (\u201cParty A\u201d) sent an email to\nrepresentatives of Moelis, requesting an introduction to the Company. On June 29, 2021, a representative of Moelis\nintroduced the representative of Party A to Steven Meehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of\nthe Company.\nOn July 8, 2021, representatives of Party A held a conference call with representatives of the Company, including\nHarlan W. Waksal, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Meehan, during which the\nparties discussed a general corporate overview of each company and potential synergies that may arise from a\ncollaboration or other strategic transaction.\nOn July 12, 2021, Mr. Merlin held a video conference with Gregory S. Moss, Executive Vice President, General\nCounsel and Corporate Secretary, Chief Compliance Officer of the Company, during which Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss\neach introduced their company to the other, and Mr. Merlin discussed Sanofi\u2019s interest in belumosudil. Mr. Moss\ndiscussed the Company\u2019s overall development plan with respect to belumosudil, including its focus on the United\nStates and pursuing various global approvals via the FDA\u2019s Project Orbis framework. Mr. Moss also discussed the\nCompany\u2019s innovative pipeline and various corporate aspects of its business.\nOn July 16, 2021, the FDA approved belumosudil for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older\nwith chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. The FDA reviewed\nthe New Drug Application six weeks ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of August 30, 2021. As a\nresult of the announcement, the per share price of the Company\u2019s common stock closed at $4.28 on July 16, 2021, up\nfrom $3.55 from the prior trading day\u2019s closing price.\nOn July 20, 2021, Mr. Merlin held a videoconference with Mr. Moss and other representatives of the Company, during\nwhich Mr. Merlin affirmed Sanofi\u2019s interest in belumosudil but also indicated that Sanofi may be interested in\nexploring a larger transaction taking into account the Company\u2019s product candidates still in development in addition\nto the commercialization of belumosudil. Mr. Merlin also noted that Sanofi was interested in learning more about the\nCompany\u2019s immuno-oncology platform and other pipeline assets and programs. On July 20, 2021, the Company\nentered into a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi which did not contain standstill provisions.\nMr. Merlin and Mr. Moss held a videoconference on July 21, 2021, where Mr. Merlin asked about the Company\u2019s\nwork-to-date around potentially separating out the Company\u2019s immuno-oncology platform. Mr. Moss responded that\na detailed analysis had not been conducted but informal options had been contemplated and considered. Mr. Merlin\nindicated that Sanofi\u2019s interest was firm and expeditious, and Mr. Merlin and Mr. Moss agreed that an in-person\nmanagement presentation was an appropriate next step, as well as contemporaneous subject matter expert\ndiscussion.\nOn July 26, 2021, Kadmon and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement with standstill provisions (which\npermitted private waivers of the standstill provision and contained a customary \u201cfallaway\u201d provision in the event the\nCompany announced a change of control transaction).\nOn July 27, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss, and Dr. Jeegar Patel, Senior Vice\nPresident, Research and Non-Clinical Development, held a meeting with representatives from Sanofi (including Mr.\nJean-Baptiste de Chatillon, Chief Financial Officer of Sanofi, Mr. Olivier Charmeil, Executive Vice President - General\nMedicines of Sanofi, Mr. Loic Gonnet, Global Head of Mergers & Acquisitions of Sanofi, and Mr. Merlin), with Mr.\nMeehan and other representatives of Sanofi participating by videoconference. During this meeting the parties\ndiscussed information regarding belumosudil, the Company\u2019s immuno-oncology platform and other information\nregarding the Company and its additional pipeline candidates. At a dinner following the meeting, Mr. de Chatillon,\nMr. Charmeil and Mr. Gonnet confirmed that Sanofi was interested in acquiring the Company.\nOn July 28, 2021, representatives of the Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Moss and Dr. Patel met with\nrepresentatives of Party A in their European headquarters with Mr. Meehan and certain representatives of Party A\nparticipating by videoconference. During this meeting the parties discussed belumosudil, the Company\u2019s product\npipeline and other information. Also, during this meeting, Party A indicated that it was interested in acquiring the\nCompany.\n24\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA potential strategic bidder for the Company (\u201cParty B\u201d) had previously indicated an interest in exploring potential\nbusiness development opportunities with the Company following approval of belumosudil. Accordingly, as the\nCompany began to have discussions with Sanofi and Party A, the Company and representatives of the Company\nFinancial Advisors discussed reaching out to Party B. On July 29, 2021, Mr. Meehan had a telephone call with a\nrepresentative of Party B to let them know the Company may be considering a potential collaboration or other\nstrategic transactions and to gauge their interest in exploring such a potential transaction.\nOn July 30, 2021, Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss held an informal discussion with Mr. Tasos Konidaris,\nChairman of the Board of Directors, and directors Mr. Arthur Kirsch and Ms. Nancy Miller-Rich, during which\nmanagement provided an update of the discussions with Sanofi, Party A and Party B.\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company received an e-mail from a representative of Party B introducing representatives of the\nCompany, including Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, to other representatives of Party B for purposes of discussing a\npotential transaction.\nOn August 1, 2021, the Company and Sanofi amended their confidentiality agreement to provide for standstill\nprovisions (which permitted private waivers of the standstill provisions and contained a customary \u201cfallaway\u201d\nprovision in the event the Company announced a change of control transaction).\nOn August 3, 2021, the Board of Directors held a regular meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, representatives\nof each of the Company Financial Advisors and a representative of DLA Piper LLP (US) (\u201cDLA Piper\u201d), outside\ncounsel to the Company. Management discussed with the Board of Directors the interest in the Company by Sanofi,\nParty A and Party B and the related discussions to date. The representative of DLA Piper then reviewed with the\nBoard of Directors their fiduciary duties and related considerations. After discussion and deliberation, including with\nrespect to potential benefits to the Company\u2019s stockholders of a potential sale of the Company and the risk and\nuncertainties if the Company were to remain an independent public company, the Board of Directors determined it to\nbe in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to take further steps to confidentially explore the\npotential interest of third parties to acquire the Company, including the interest of Sanofi, Party A and Party B. The\nBoard of Directors also designated Mr. Konidaris, Mr. Kirsch and Ms. Miller-Rich, each of whom is an independent,\ndisinterested director, and Dr. Waksal, as members of a transaction committee of the Board of Directors (the\n\u201cTransaction Committee\u201d) and instructed the Transaction Committee to engage Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis, and to\noversee the activities of management and Cantor Fitzgerald and Moelis in connection with exploring a potential sale\nof the Company and to provide follow-up communication to the Board of Directors, as appropriate. However, the\nBoard of Directors determined that final authority with respect to any transaction would reside with the full Board of\nDirectors. The Transaction Committee was set up for efficiency purposes, and not due to any perceived conflict of\ninterest with respect to any member of the Board of Directors.\nOn August 4, 2021, each of Sanofi and Party A were notified that the Board of Directors had engaged the Company\nFinancial Advisors and authorized the exploration of a potential sale of the Company. In addition, Party A was\nprovided access to a virtual data room. Also on August 4, 2021, the Company received a non-binding indication of\ninterest from Sanofi to acquire all of the Common Stock for $7.00 per share, a 55% premium to the closing price per\nshare on August 3, 2021, and with a request to enter into an exclusivity agreement. After receipt of the non-binding\nindication of interest, the Transaction Committee held a virtual meeting attended by Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss, Kyle\nCarver, the Company\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer, representatives of the Company Financial Advisors and\nrepresentatives of DLA Piper to review the Sanofi non-binding indication of interest and, after discussion, determined\nthat it undervalued the Company. After discussion, the Transaction Committee directed management of the Company\nto inform Sanofi that the proposal undervalued the Company and the Company was not interested in a transaction at\nthat level. Following the meeting, management delivered the Board of Director\u2019s message to Sanofi.\nBetween August 4, 2021 and August 23, 2021, Party A conducted due diligence.\nOn August 5, 6 and 7, 2021, the Company Financial Advisors held calls with representatives of Centerview Partners,\nfinancial advisor to Sanofi (\u201cCenterview\u201d) to discuss the Company\u2019s rationale for rejecting Sanofi\u2019s August 4, 2021\nproposal.\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company and Party B entered into a confidentiality agreement that contained standstill\nprovisions (which permitted private waivers of the standstill provision, private offers to the Board of Directors and\ncontained a customary \u201cfallaway\u201d provision in the event the Company announced a change of control transaction).\n25\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 6, 2021, Party B was provided access to the virtual data room. Also on August 6, 2021, representatives of\nthe Company, including Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss and Mr. Patel held a telephone conference with Party A,\nin which the parties discussed research and development related to the Company\u2019s products other than belumosudil.\nOn August 9, 2021, the Company received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Sanofi to acquire all of\nthe Common Stock for $9.00 per share, an 81% premium to the closing price per share on August 6, 2021, and with a\nrequest to enter into an exclusivity agreement.\nOn August 10, the Transaction Committee, together with Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, met to discuss interactions to\ndate with Sanofi, Party A and Party B and to review Sanofi\u2019s August 9, 2021 revised non-binding indication of\ninterest. The Transaction Committee instructed the management team to explore potential transaction opportunities\nwith parties other than Sanofi, Party A and Party B. The Transaction Committee also instructed the Company\u2019s\nmanagement team to convey to Sanofi that the Company would not agree to exclusivity at an offer price of $9.00 per\nshare, but that it would allow Sanofi to begin conducting its due diligence. In addition, after discussions with\nmanagement and representatives of the Company Financial Advisors, the Transaction Committee directed\nrepresentatives of the Company Financial Advisors to reach out to six other strategic companies to gauge their\ninterest in a potential transaction with the Company.\nBetween August 10 and August 11, at the direction of Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan and Mr. Moss, representatives of the\nCompany Financial Advisors contacted six other strategic companies in connection with exploring a business\ncombination transaction with the Company, but none of the six parties expressed meaningful interest in such a\ntransaction.\nOn August 11, 2021, at the direction of the Transaction Committee, representatives of the Company Financial\nAdvisors discussed Sanofi\u2019s August 9, 2021 proposal with representatives of Centerview and conveyed that,\nalthough Sanofi\u2019s August 9, 2021 proposal was below the Company\u2019s expectations and exclusivity would not be\ngranted, Sanofi and its representatives would be provided with access to a virtual data room in order to conduct due\ndiligence.\nOn August 11, 2021, Dr. Waksal, Mr. Meehan, Mr. Moss and Mr. Patel participated in a management presentation with\nrepresentatives of Party B by videoconference.\nOn August 12, 2021, Sanofi was provided access to a virtual data room.

Based in part on the status of\ndiscussions with Party B, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement with\nSanofi based on a price per share of at least $9.50.

        "Section Text": "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThis section describes the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this\nsection and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the\ncomplete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement. You are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety before\nmaking any decisions regarding the Merger, including approval of the Merger Proposal, as it is the legal document\ngoverning the Merger. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about the Company,\nSanofi or Merger Sub. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings the\nCompany makes with the SEC, as described under the heading \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information\u201d\nbeginning on page 85 of this proxy statement.\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The rights and obligations of the\nparties under the Merger Agreement are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this\nsummary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by Sanofi, Merger Sub and the Company in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of\nmateriality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases\nwere qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Sanofi and Merger Sub by the Company in connection with the\nMerger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement\nfor the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those\napplicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not\nrely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of\nthe actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Sanofi or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the Agreement Date. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual\nlimitations on the respective businesses of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub, because the parties may take\ncertain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential Company disclosure letter to the Merger\nAgreement (the \u201cCompany Disclosure Letter\u201d) or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent\nmay be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A,\nonly to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual\ninformation regarding the Company, Sanofi, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and\nyou should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding the\nCompany and our business.\nThe Merger\nEffects of the Merger\u037e Certificate of Incorporation\u037e Bylaws\u037e Officers and Directors\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge\nwith and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL.

At or prior to the Effective Time, Sanofi shall provide or\ncause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to\nstockholders (less any Merger Consideration in respect of any Excluded Shares and Preferred Stock).\nPromptly following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will send to each holder of record of shares of Common\nStock at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock\ncertificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Promptly following the Effective Time,\nSanofi will pay each holder of Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration payable in respect of their\nshares of Preferred Stock.\nYou should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock\ncertificates to the Exchange Agent without a letter of transmittal.\nEach holder of shares of Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration\nshall be entitled to receive, upon (1) surrender to the Exchange Agent of the certificate representing such shares of\nCommon Stock, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal or (2) receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the\nExchange Agent (or such other evidence of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a\nbook-entry transfer of uncertificated shares, the Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of the Common\nStock represented by such certificate or uncertificated shares. The amount of any Common Stock Merger\nConsideration paid to the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.\nIf any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is not claimed within one year following the Effective Time, such cash\nwill be returned to Sanofi, upon demand, and any holders of Common Stock who have not complied with the\n58\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexchange procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Sanofi for payment of the Merger\nConsideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent\nthat remains unclaimed immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise become property of a\nGovernmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Sanofi free and clear\nof any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.\nIf any stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to\nreceive the Merger Consideration, such stockholder will have to make an affidavit of that fact claiming such stock\ncertificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sanofi, deliver a written indemnity agreement in form and\nsubstance reasonably acceptable to Sanofi.\nAppraisal Rights\nStockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. This means that you are\nentitled to have the fair value of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of the Merger Consideration if you follow exactly\nthe procedures specified under the DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less\nthan, equal to or more than the amount you would have received under the Merger Agreement.\nTo exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is\ntaken on the Merger Agreement and you must not vote (either in person or by proxy) in favor of the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in\nthe loss of your appraisal rights. See \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 79 and the text of the Delaware appraisal\nrights statute reproduced in its entirety as Annex B to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Common\nStock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult\nwith your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand\nfor appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.\nTHE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE\nWITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD\nCONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION\n262 OF THE DGCL, THE FULL TEXT OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS ANNEX B.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company, Sanofi and Merger Sub.\nSome of the representations and

Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a\nSuperior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) in the case referred to in clause (iii)\nabove, the Board of Directors

        "Section Text": "APPRAISAL RIGHTS\nUnder the DGCL, if you do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement, you\nhave the right to seek appraisal of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and to receive payment in cash\nfor the fair value of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from\nthe accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value. The \u201cfair value\u201d of your shares of Common\nStock or Preferred Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as,\nthe Merger Consideration, that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. These\nrights are known as appraisal rights. The Company\u2019s stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must not\nvote in favor of the Merger Proposal and must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d)\nin order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures in Section 262 is required. Failure to\nfollow precisely any of the statutory requirements will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.\nThis section is intended as a brief summary of certain provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures that a\nstockholder must follow in order to seek and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete\nstatement of all applicable requirements, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the\nfull text of which appears in Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The following\nsummary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders\nexercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.\nSection 262 requires that where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, as in\nthe case of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, the stockholders be notified that appraisal rights will be\navailable not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the Merger. A copy of Section 262 must be included\nwith such notice. This proxy statement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are\navailable in connection with the Merger, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If you wish to consider\nexercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex B. Failure to\ncomply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL.\nIf you elect to demand appraisal of your shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, you must satisfy each of the\nfollowing conditions: You must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares of Common\nStock or Preferred Stock before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal, which must reasonably inform us of the\nidentity of the holder of record of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock and that the stockholder intends\nthereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and you must not vote or\nsubmit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal.\nIf you fail to comply with either of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the\napplicable Merger Consideration for your shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock as provided for\nin the Merger Agreement, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of the Company\u2019s\nCommon Stock or Preferred Stock. A holder of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock wishing to\nexercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of record\nthrough the Effective Time, because appraisal rights will be lost if the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are\ntransferred prior to the Effective Time. Voting against or failing to vote for the Merger Proposal by itself does not\nconstitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal, and it will constitute a waiver of\nthe stockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.\nTherefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either submit a proxy\ncontaining instructions to vote against the Merger Proposal or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. The\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.\nAll demands for appraisal should be addressed to Kadmon Holdings, Inc., 450 East 29th Street, New York, NY 10016,\nand must be delivered before the vote is taken on the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and should be\nexecuted by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock. The demand must\nreasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand\nappraisal of his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.\n79TABLE OF CONTENTS\nTo be effective, a demand for appraisal by a stockholder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock must be made by, or in\nthe name of, the record stockholder, fully and correctly, as the stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stockholder\u2019s stock\ncertificate(s) or in the transfer agent\u2019s records, in the case of uncertificated shares. The demand cannot be made\ndirectly by the beneficial owner if he or she does not also hold the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of\nrecord. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other\nnominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of Common Stock. If you hold your shares of the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal\nrights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or the other nominee to determine the appropriate\nprocedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.\nIf shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,\nguardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity. If the shares of Common\nStock or Preferred Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common,\nthe demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two\nor more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record\u037e however, the agent must\nidentify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting\nas agent for the record owner. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of\nCommon Stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the shares of\nCommon Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In\nthat case, the written demand should state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought.\nWhere no number of shares of Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all\nshares of Common Stock held in the name of the record owner.\nWithin ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must give notice of the date that the Merger has\nbecome effective to each of the Company\u2019s stockholders who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and\nwho did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any\nstockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw\nthe demand and accept the cash payment specified by the Merger Agreement for that stockholder\u2019s shares of the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective\nTime will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Unless the demand is properly withdrawn by the\nstockholder within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of\nChancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such\napproval conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a\nrequest to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does\nnot approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised\nvalue determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the\nconsideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, either the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who\nhas complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may\ncommence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination\nof the value of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. Upon\nthe filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition will be made upon the Surviving\nCorporation. The Surviving Corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, and holders should not assume that\nthe Surviving Corporation will file a petition. Accordingly, the failure of a stockholder to file such a petition within the\nperiod specified could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal. In addition, within 120 days\nafter the Effective Time, any stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote\nin favor of the Merger Agreement, upon written request, will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation a\nstatement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock not voted in favor of\nthe Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate\nnumber of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such written\nrequest has been received by the Surviving Corporation. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock or Preferred Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person\nmay, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation such\nstatement.\n80\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving\nCorporation, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the\npetition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all\nstockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock have not been reached. After notice to\nstockholders who have demanded appraisal, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition and to determine those\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided by\nSection 262. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their\nshares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation\nof the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total\nnumber of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) or (2) the value of the consideration\nprovided in the Merger for such total number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock exceeds $1,000,000.\nAfter determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and\nPreferred Stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock,\ndetermining their fair value as of the Effective Time after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be\npaid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nwill direct the payment of such value together with interest, if any, upon surrender by those stockholders of the\ncertificates representing their shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and, in the case of holders of\nuncertificated stock, forthwith. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded\nquarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1)\nthe difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\nYou should be aware that investment banking opinions as to fairness from a financial point of view is not necessarily\nan opinion as to fair value under Section 262. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration is fair, no\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of an appraisal of fair value by the Delaware Court of Chancery and\nstockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower\nthan, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, we reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Common Stock is less than the Common\nStock Merger Consideration. In determining \u201cfair value,\u201d the Delaware Court is required to take into account all\nrelevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or\nmethods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the\nvalue of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value the court\nmust consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfacts which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the\nmerged corporation.\nSection 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such\nexclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only\nto the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware\nSupreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,\nwhich are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be\nconsidered.\u201d\n81\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCosts of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the Surviving Corporation and the stockholders\nparticipating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery, as it deems equitable in the\ncircumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of\nthe expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts used in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro\nrata against the value of all shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who\ndemanded appraisal rights will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote shares of Common Stock or Preferred\nStock subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with\nrespect to those shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, other than with respect to distributions payable to\nstockholders as of a record date prior to the Effective Time. However, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120\ndays after the Effective Time, or if the stockholder otherwise fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such\nholder\u2019s right to appraisal, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and that stockholder will be\nentitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in cash, without interest thereon, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, for his, her or its shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nIn view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, the Company\u2019s stockholders who may wish to pursue\nappraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.\n82\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,\nthe provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply\nas nearly as is practicable.\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\n(d)\nAppraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\n(1)\nIf a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be\nsubmitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the\nmeeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting\n(or such members who received notice in accordance with \u00a7\u2002255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for\nwhich appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are\navailable for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy\nof this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7\u2002114 of this\ntitle. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares shall deliver to the\ncorporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic\ntransmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose\nin such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the\nstockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s\nshares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A\nstockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided.\nWithin 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this\nsubsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the\nmerger or consolidation has become effective\u037e or\n(2)\nIf the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this title, then\neither a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or\nresulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of\nstock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or\nconsolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of\nsuch constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the\nconstituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if\ngiven on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of\nthe effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20\ndays after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this\ntitle, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days\nafter the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the\nappraisal of such holder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by\nelectronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for\nthat purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the\nidentity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such\nholder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective\ndate of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such\nconstituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such\nholders on or within 10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent\nmore than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to\n\u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this\ntitle and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each\nstockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in\naccordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent\nof the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the\nabsence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the\nstockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record\ndate that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is\ngiven on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective\ndate. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the\nclose of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\nB-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(e)\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or\nany stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise\nentitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery\ndemanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at\nany time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with\nthe requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic\ntransmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the\nnotice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the\nconsolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or\nconsolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of\nshares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were\nnot tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either\ncase, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of\nsuch shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request\nfor such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock\nheld either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\n(f)\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register\nin Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all\nstockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in\nChancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition\nby registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list\nat the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before\nthe day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or\nsuch publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be\napproved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\n(g)\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section\nand who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded\nan appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock\nto the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any\nstockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.\nIf immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent\ncorporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court\nshall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or\nseries eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such\ntotal number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n(h)\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive\nof any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together\nwith interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value,\nthe Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for\ngood cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period\nbetween the\nB-3\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neffective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment\nin the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in\ncash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if\nany, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest\ntheretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by\nany stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to\ntrial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any\nstockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to\nsubsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in\nChancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such\nstockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.\n(i)\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving\nor resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder,\nin the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by\ncertificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s decree\nmay be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or\nresulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.\n(j)\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems\nequitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the\nexpenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all\nthe shares entitled to an appraisal.\n(k)\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal\nrights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to\nreceive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions\npayable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation)\u037e\nprovided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of\nthis section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60\ndays after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or\nthereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall\ncease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to\nany stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as\nthe Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who\nhas not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60\ndays after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\n(l)\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would\nhave been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and\nunissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

(\u201cCF&CO\u201d) to render our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be\nreceived by holders of Kadmon Common Stock (other than Sanofi and its affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of\nview, to such holders.\nIn the course of performing our reviews and analyses for rendering this opinion, we have:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft of the Agreement, dated September 7, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed Kadmon\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, its Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K filed\nsince December 31, 2020\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain operating and financial information relating to Kadmon\u2019s business and prospects, including\nprojections for Kadmon for the 14 years ended December 31, 2034, all as prepared and provided to us by\nKadmon\u2019s management\u037e\n\u2022\nmet with certain members of Kadmon\u2019s senior management to discuss Kadmon\u2019s business, operations, historical\nand projected financial results and future prospects\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the historical prices and trading volume of the Kadmon Common Stock\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available financial data, stock market performance data and trading multiples of\ncompanies which we deemed generally comparable to Kadmon\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the terms of certain relevant mergers and acquisitions involving companies which we deemed generally\ncomparable to Kadmon\u037e\n\u2022\nperformed a discounted cash flow analysis based on the projections for Kadmon furnished to us by Kadmon\u2019s\nmanagement\u037e and\n\u2022\nconducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as we deemed appropriate.\nWe have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial\nand other information provided to or discussed with us by Kadmon or obtained by us from public sources, including,\nwithout limitation, the projections referred to above. With respect to the projections, we have relied on\nrepresentations that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of the senior management of Kadmon as to the expected future performance of Kadmon. We have not\nassumed any responsibility for the independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any such\nC-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\ninformation, including, without limitation, the projections\u037e we express no view or opinion as to such projections or\nthe assumptions upon which they are based\u037e and we have further relied upon the assurances of the senior\nmanagement of Kadmon that it is unaware of any facts that would make the information or projections incomplete or\nmisleading. We have assumed that the executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from those reviewed\nby CF&CO.\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities\n(contingent or otherwise) of Kadmon, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. During the course of our\nengagement, we were asked by the Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from various third parties\nregarding a transaction with Kadmon, and we have considered the results of such solicitation in rendering our\nopinion. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms\nof the Agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory or\notherwise, that would be material in any respect to our analysis or our opinion. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or\naccounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by Kadmon and its advisors with respect to such\nissues. Our opinion does not address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters.\nWe do not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of Kadmon Common Stock may\ntrade subsequent to the announcement of the Merger.\nWe have acted as a financial advisor to Kadmon in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for\nsuch services, a substantial portion of which is contingent on successful consummation of the Merger. A portion of\nour compensation is payable upon delivery of this letter and may be credited against the fee payable upon\nconsummation of the Merger. In addition, Kadmon has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify\nus against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.\nCF&CO has previously been engaged (and may currently be engaged) by Kadmon to provide certain investment\nbanking and other services on matters unrelated to the Merger, for which we have received (or expect to receive)\ncustomary fees. CF&CO may seek to provide Kadmon and Sanofi and their respective affiliates with certain\ninvestment banking and other services unrelated to the Merger in the future.\nConsistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, CF&CO has adopted certain policies and procedures to\nestablish and maintain the independence of CF&CO\u2019s research departments and personnel. As a result, CF&CO\u2019s\nresearch analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports\nwith respect to Kadmon, Sanofi, the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from the views of\nCF&CO\u2019s investment banking personnel.\nIn the ordinary course of business, CF&CO and its affiliates may actively trade (for their own accounts and for the\naccounts of their customers) certain equity and debt securities, bank debt and/or other financial instruments issued\nby Kadmon and/or Sanofi and their respective affiliates, as well as derivatives thereof, and, accordingly, may at any\ntime hold long or short positions in such securities, bank debt, financial instruments and derivatives.\nIt is understood that this letter is intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of Kadmon (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Merger. This letter and our opinion are not to be used\nfor any other purpose, or be reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole or in part,\nwithout our prior written consent\u037e provided, however, that this letter may be included in its entirety in the proxy\nstatement to be distributed to the holders of Kadmon Common Stock in connection with the Merger. This letter and\nour opinion do not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors of Kadmon in connection with the Merger,\nnor do this letter and our opinion constitute a recommendation to how any holders of Kadmon Common Stock should\nvote or act with respect to the Merger or any related matter. Our opinion does not address Kadmon\u2019s underlying\nbusiness decision to pursue the Merger, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business or\nfinancial strategies that might exist for Kadmon or the effects of any other Merger in which Kadmon might engage.\nOur opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Kadmon Common Stock\n(other than Sanofi and its affiliates) of the Consideration and does not address any other term, aspect or implication\nof the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. In addition, we do not express any\nview or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or\nto be received by any of Kadmon\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with\nthe Merger relative to the Consideration or otherwise.\nC-2\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOur opinion has been authorized for issuance by the Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee of CF&CO.
