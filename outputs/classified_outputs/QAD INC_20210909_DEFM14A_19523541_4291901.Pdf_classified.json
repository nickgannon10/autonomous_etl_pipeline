Our directors and\nexecutive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all\nof the Shares owned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and\neach of the other proposals. As of September 7, 2021, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, our\ndirectors and executive officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 5,731,052 shares of Class A Common\nStock and 2,581,322 shares of Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or\ncollectively approximately 68% of the total voting power entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. For\npurposes of clarity, the Shares directly owned by the directors and executive officers shall be (i)\nincluded in determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by the affirmative vote of\nholders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single\nclass, but (ii) excluded from determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by\naffirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares, voting as a\nsingle class, that are not owned, beneficially or of record, by the Lopker Entities, their respective\naffiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company. For a further description of the voting\nintentions of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers, see \u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202fIntent of the\nDirectors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger.\u201d\nIntent of the Lopker Entities to Vote in Favor of the Merger. The Lopker Entities and the Lopker\nFamily Foundation, who hold approximately 67% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding\n4 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncapital stock, have duly executed and entered into a Support Agreement, pursuant to which they have\nagreed to vote their Shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms\nand conditions of the Support Agreement. Copies of the Support Agreement and the Lopker Family\nFoundation\u2019s Joinder to the Support Agreement are attached as Annexes B and F to the proxy\nstatement and are incorporated by reference in the proxy statement in their entirety. For more\ninformation about the Support Agreement and the voting intentions of the Lopker Entities, see\n\u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202fIntent of the Lopker Entities to Vote in Favor of the Merger\u201d and \u201cSpecial\nFactors\u202f-\u202fSupport Agreement.\u201d\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash\nin the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders (as defined below in \u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202f\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes and may also be taxable under state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws. A U.S. Holder who solely\nreceives cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in\nan amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash received by such holder in the Merger and\nthe adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor. Stockholders who are Non-U.S.\nHolders (as defined below in \u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nthe Merger\u201d) will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in\nconnection with the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United\nStates. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on the\nstockholder\u2019s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to\ndetermine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application of any U.S. federal non-\nincome, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws) of the Merger. For further information about the material\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see \u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202fMaterial U.S. Federal\nIncome Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nFinancing of the Merger. The Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent estimates that\nthe total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be\napproximately $1.6 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded via approximately $0.9 billion from\nequity investments by TB Fund XIV and approximately $0.7 billion from debt financing by specified\nlenders.\nParent has delivered to the Company the Equity Commitment Letter, pursuant to which TB Fund XIV\nhas committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, to provide equity financing in\nan aggregate amount of up to $1,626,900,000 to Parent on or prior to the closing of the Merger in\nconnection with the funding of the transaction. The Company is a third party beneficiary of the rights\ngranted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter (if and only if the Company is entitled to\nspecific performance of Parent and Merger Sub\u2019s obligations to consummate the Merger) solely for\nthe purpose of seeking specific performance of Parent\u2019s right to cause the commitment to be funded\nin accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter (solely to the extent that Parent can\ncause the commitment to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter). For\nfurther information about the financing of the Merger, see \u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202fFinancing of the\nMerger.\u201d\nLimited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent has delivered to\nthe Company a Limited Guaranty, dated as of June 27, 2021 (the \u201cLimited Guaranty\u201d), entered into by\nTB Fund XIV in favor of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Guaranty and subject to\nthe terms and conditions set forth therein, TB Fund XIV has agreed to guarantee Parent\u2019s obligations\nunder the Merger Agreement, capped at $133,000,000, with respect to payment of the Parent\nTermination Fee and certain interest payments and reimbursement obligations of Parent. For a further\ndescription of the Limited Guaranty, see Special Factors\u202f-\u202fLimited Guaranty.\u201d\nRegulatory Approvals. Under the HSR Act and the antitrust laws of certain other foreign\njurisdictions, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications\nhave been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,\nand the Federal Trade Commission, and similar filings have been made under the antitrust laws of\ncertain other foreign jurisdictions, and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.\n5 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExpiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR\nAct and the antitrust laws of certain other foreign jurisdictions, and the making of and receipt of,\ncertain other specified regulatory filings and consents, are conditions to completion of the Merger.\nFor a further description of the regulatory approvals required for the Merger, see \u201cSpecial Factors -\nRegulatory Approvals\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fRegulatory Approvals\u037e Third Party Consents.\u201d\nLitigation Relating to the Merger. Currently, the Company is aware of four (4) pending cases related\nto the Merger. In Nantahala Capital Partners II L.P. v. QAD Inc., et al., a purported stockholder class\naction filed in Delaware Chancery Court on July 2, 2021, the plaintiff alleges breaches of contract and\nfiduciary duty against directors Anton Chilton, Scott Adelson, Kathleen Crusco, and Peter van\nCuylenburg (the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d), and Pamela M. Lopker, as well as a claim for aiding and\nabetting a breach of fiduciary duty against Thoma Bravo and certain affiliates of Thoma Bravo\nrelating to the QAD Board's vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The complaint names the\nCompany as a defendant to the extent necessary for any of the relief requested. Plaintiff is seeking,\namong other things, to enjoin the Closing of the Merger or, in the alternative, damages, including\nrescissory damages. The plaintiff claims that the Contribution and Exchange Agreement (pursuant to\nwhich and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute to Ultimate\nParent the Rollover Shares and, in exchange for such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent will issue to the\nLopker Entities the Parent Units) and the Merger Agreement violate Article IV, Section 2.B(d) of\nQAD\u2019s corporate charter, which provides that holders of Class A Common Stock receive per Share\nconsideration no less favorable than that received by any holders of Class B Common Stock in any\nmerger. The plaintiff alleges that Ms. Lopker and the Director Defendants breached Article IV, Section\n2.B(d) of QAD\u2019s corporate charter, that Ms. Lopker\u2019s participation in the separate Contribution and\nExchange Agreement with Thoma Bravo breached her fiduciary duties to the Company, that the\nDirector Defendants\u2019 approval of the Merger breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, and that\nThoma Bravo and its affiliates aided and abetted those breaches. In a supplement to their complaint,\nfiled on August 16, 2021, Plaintiff alleges that the Director Defendants and Ms. Lopker breached their\nfiduciary duties by disseminating a false, misleading, and materially incomplete Proxy, and that Thoma\nBravo aided and abetted those breaches. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that the Proxy, issued on August\n2, 2021, provides an inaccurate description of the events leading to the Merger and the consideration\nthat Ms. Lopker will receive in connection with the Merger. The court has ordered that the case\nproceed on an expedited basis. The Company believes the claims are without any merit. On August 5\nand 6, 2021, purported shareholders of the Company filed two complaints in the District Court of the\nSouthern District of New York, captioned Stein v. QAD Inc., et. al., 1:21-cv-06856 and Whitfield v.\nQAD, Inc., et. al., 1:21-cv-06674, both naming the Company and members of its board of directors as\ndefendants. On September 3, 2021, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a complaint in the\nDistrict Court of the Eastern District of New York, captioned Parmar v.QADInc., et al., 1:21-cv-04974,\nnaming the Company and members of its board of directors as defendants. All three actions assert\nfederal securities claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and related provisions for\nalleged failures to disclose material information, and seek to enjoin or rescind the Merger with Thoma\nBravo and a request for an award of attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees and damages. The Company believes\nthese actions, too, are without merit. For a further description of litigation relating to the Merger, see\n\u201cSpecial Factors\u202f-\u202fLitigation Relating to the Merger.\u201d\nThe Merger Agreement (page 77)\nA summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this\nproxy statement and which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety, is\nincluded in \u201cThe Merger Agreement.\u201d\nEffective Time and Closing of the Merger. We are working to complete the Merger as promptly as\npracticable. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the fourth (4 ) quarter of 2021. If our\nstockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will become effective as promptly as\npracticable following the satisfaction or written waiver of the other conditions to the Merger as\n6 \nth\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nset forth in the Merger Agreement, including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and\nconsents.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nSPECIAL FACTORS\nThe following, together with the summary of the Merger Agreement set forth under the section titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement,\u201d is a description of the material aspects of the Merger. While we believe that the\nfollowing description covers the material aspects of the Merger, the description may not contain all of the\ninformation that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully this entire document, including the\nMerger Agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the\nMerger. The following description is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Merger\nAgreement. You may obtain additional information without charge as described in the section titled \u201cWhere\nYou Can Find More Information.\u201d\nWe are asking our stockholders to consider and vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company\nwith the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed,\nthe holders of Shares (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) will have the right to receive the\nMerger Consideration of $87.50 per Share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes,\nsubject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nBackground of the Merger\nQAD regularly evaluates strategies for improving its competitive position and enhancing stockholder value.\nAs part of these evaluations, the QAD Board has, from time to time, considered various strategic\nalternatives, such as public offerings, joint ventures, collaborations and business combinations, including a\npossible merger or sale of QAD. From time to time, prior to 2021, QAD received unsolicited indications of\ninterest from third parties.\nDuring 2019 and 2020, the QAD Board and senior management met from time to time with multiple potential\nfinancial advisors, including, among other firms, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, which we refer to as Morgan\nStanley, to receive market and industry updates, evaluate the financial advisors\u2019 capabilities, and to discuss\na potential review of strategic alternatives for QAD. No financial advisors were engaged.\nOn December 14, 2020, the QAD Board invited representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss with the QAD\nBoard the most recent developments in the software industry, equity markets, potential strategic alternatives\nand the general economy.\nOn February 9, 2021, the QAD Board and its legal counsel, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, which we refer to\nas Manatt, met to discuss, among other things, a potential review of strategic alternatives for QAD. In\nconnection with such discussion, a representative of Manatt provided the QAD Board with an overview of\nlegal considerations in connection with potential transactions, including the potential formation of a special\ncommittee. After discussion and deliberation, the independent members of the QAD Board determined to\nrequest that senior management of QAD meet with representatives of Morgan Stanley in order for such\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley to provide their views regarding recent developments in the software\nindustry and potential strategic options for the Company.\nOn February 18, 2021, Ms. Lopker, the President and founder of QAD, Mr. Anton Chilton, the Chief Executive\nOfficer of QAD, and Mr. Daniel Lender, the Chief Financial Officer of QAD, met with representatives of\nMorgan Stanley to review potential strategic alternatives for QAD. After such meeting, Messrs. Chilton and\nLender discussed the meeting with Mr. Peter van Cuylenburg, the chair of the QAD Board.\nOver the following days, after discussion and deliberation, the members of the QAD Board executed a\nunanimous written consent, effective as of February 21, 2021, to form the Special Committee, with Mr. van\nCuylenburg, Mr. Scott Adelson, Ms. Kathy Crusco and Mr. Lee Roberts as its members. The QAD Board\ndetermined each member of the Special Committee to be unaffiliated with, and otherwise independent from,\nMs. Lopker and to be otherwise independent and disinterested with respect to the Special Committee\u2019s\nmandate. The Special Committee was delegated the full power and authority of the QAD Board to review,\nevaluate and negotiate potential strategic alternatives, to engage its own advisors and to make a\n21 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nrecommendation to the QAD Board regarding any such transaction. The resolution also provided that the\nQAD Board would not recommend any potential transaction to QAD stockholders without a prior favorable\nrecommendation by the Special Committee.\nDuring this same period, members of the Special Committee recommended to Ms. Lopker that she retain\nindependent financial and legal advisors. Ms. Lopker also expressed to such members her willingness to\npursue a process, her openness to consider any type of transaction, and her preference for retaining an\nongoing stake in the Company.\nOn February 23, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Morgan Stanley to further evaluate\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s capabilities and to review Morgan Stanley\u2019s tentative proposed plan to reach out to third\nparties potentially interested in a transaction with QAD.\nOn February 24, 2021, Ms. Lopker retained Paul Hastings LLP, which we refer to as Paul Hastings, as legal\ncounsel to the Lopker Entities in connection with a potential transaction.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, at which the members discussed their review of, and\nmeetings with, various potential law firms that the Special Committee was considering for engagement as\nlegal counsel to the Special Committee.\nOn March 8, 2021, the Special Committee met and, after discussion and deliberation, approved the selection\nof Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which we refer to as Paul, Weiss, as legal counsel to the\nSpecial Committee. The Special Committee selected Paul, Weiss based, in part, on its experience representing\nspecial committees in circumstances similar to that of the Special Committee. At this meeting, the Special\nCommittee also appointed Messrs. van Cuylenburg and Adelson as co-chairs of the Special Committee.\nOn March 9, 2021, the Special Committee provided Paul, Weiss an executed engagement letter formalizing\nPaul, Weiss\u2019s engagement as legal counsel to the Special Committee.\nOn March 15, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, attended by representatives of Paul, Weiss and\nMorgan Stanley, to discuss, among other topics, organizational matters to facilitate the Special Committee\u2019s\nreview and process. During this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee\na preliminary overview of potential strategic alternatives for QAD. Morgan Stanley also disclosed its\nrelationships with respect to several potential counterparties. Also during such meeting, representatives of\nMorgan Stanley confirmed that it had not performed any work or services for Ms. Lopker, nor had it provided\nany financial analysis regarding QAD to any third party. The members of the Special Committee and\nrepresentatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussions in an executive session.\nThereafter, and after further discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee determined to engage\nMorgan Stanley as its financial advisor, based in part, on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, expertise and\nreputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in QAD\u2019s industry, and its knowledge of\nQAD\u2019s business and affairs, with such engagement being formalized in a written engagement letter dated\nMarch 30, 2021.\nDuring the period from mid-March 2021 to early May 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee,\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley contacted over 25 potential counterparties, including both potential\nstrategic counterparties and financial sponsors, to gauge their interest in potential transactions with QAD.\nDuring this period, QAD entered into 18 confidentiality agreements with interested parties. None of these\nconfidentiality agreements included any standstill provisions.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender, met with representatives of all\n18 parties that signed confidentiality agreements to provide background regarding QAD and its financial\nperformance.\nDuring the period from mid-March 2021 to early May 2021, the Special Committee held regular weekly\nmeetings with its advisors, including on March 22, March 29, April 5, April 12, April 19 and April 26, 2021. All\nmeetings included discussion among the members of the Special Committee with representatives of Paul,\nWeiss during an executive session. The Special Committee invited Messrs. Chilton and Lender to participate\nin certain portions of such meetings, and instructed Messrs. Chilton and Lender not\n22 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto have any discussions relating to information learned in a Special Committee meeting with anyone,\nincluding Ms. Lopker, without the permission of the Special Committee.\nOn May 3, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley, as well\nas Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss status\nof the process and timeline for requesting preliminary indications of interest from the eight potential\ncounterparties who continued to show engagement in the process. After review and deliberation, the Special\nCommittee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to send a process letter to such parties containing bid\ninstructions and procedures (the form of which was approved by the Special Committee) and to request\npreliminary indications of interest by May 11, 2021. Over the course of the following weeks, representatives\nof Morgan Stanley, together with Messrs. Chilton and Lender, continued to participate in due diligence\ndiscussions upon the request of the potential counterparties involved in the process.\nAlso on May 3, 2021, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors outreach to additional potential\ncounterparties. At the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley then proceeded\nto contact two additional potential counterparties, which we refer to as Party C and Party D, to gauge their\ninterest in participating in the process.\nOn May 10, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party C. Such confidentiality agreement\ndid not include any standstill provisions.\nOn May 11, 2021, on behalf of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley received written\npreliminary, non-binding indications of interest from two of the eight parties who had been sent a process\nletter, which indications were promptly provided to the Special Committee and its advisors. The two parties\nwho submitted preliminary indications of interest were Thoma Bravo and a party we refer to as Party B.\nThoma Bravo\u2019s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which QAD stockholders would\nreceive up to $90 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash\nconsideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Thoma Bravo\u2019s indication of interest\nindependently raised the possibility of Ms. Lopker continuing to hold a portion of her interests in QAD by\nrolling over a percentage of her holdings and also expressly stated that, in connection with its diligence,\nThoma Bravo representatives would require discussions with Ms. Lopker regarding her involvement in the\nCompany following the closing of the proposed transaction. Party B\u2019s indication of interest outlined a\npotential transaction in which QAD stockholders would receive approximately $86 per share in cash, subject\nto further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt\nand equity. Party B also verbally indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley its request to meet with Ms.\nLopker to discuss her involvement in the Company following the closing of the proposed transaction. Both\nThoma Bravo and Party B indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they would each require a\nsupport agreement in connection with any transaction, which would require, among other things, that the\nLopker Entities vote in favor of the contemplated transaction (subject to certain exceptions) with the relevant\ncounterparty.\nFour of the eight parties that received the process letter expressed to representatives of Morgan Stanley\npotential interest in a transaction with QAD at a \u201clow-to-no premium\u201d value over the then-current publicly\ntraded price per share, but did not submit any indications of interest. The remaining two parties who had\nreceived a process letter expressed to representatives of Morgan Stanley potential interest in a private\ninvestment in public equity transaction with QAD, but did not submit indications of interest. On May 11,\n2021, QAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $67.30.\nOn May 12, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided to the Special Committee an updated\nrelationship disclosure letter with respect to Thoma Bravo and Party B, the two parties who submitted\npreliminary indications of interest.\nAlso on May 12, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan\nStanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to\ndiscuss the preliminary indications of interest received, the status of the process and potential next steps.\nThe Special Committee reiterated that Messrs. Chilton and Lender were not to have any discussions relating\nto information learned in a Special Committee meeting with anyone, including Ms. Lopker, without\n23 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe permission of the Special Committee, and added that no one other than members of the Special\nCommittee were to discuss the process or preliminary indications of interest with Ms. Lopker at that stage.\nThe members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion during an\nexecutive session of the meeting. After review and deliberation, the Special Committee determined to seek\nadditional details from each of Thoma Bravo and Party B regarding their respective preliminary indications of\ninterest.\nOn May 13, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party\nC.\nOn May 14, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party D. Such confidentiality agreement\ndid not include any standstill provisions.\nAlso on May 14, 2021, Messrs. van Cuylenburg and Adelson met with Ms. Lopker to provide her with the\nhigh-level terms of the preliminary indications of interest received from each of Thoma Bravo and Party B.\nMs. Lopker indicated that she was interested in continuing to have a role in QAD following the closing of a\npotential transaction if one were to occur, and that she was open to discussions with each of Thoma Bravo\nand Party B about such role. Ms. Lopker indicated that she had not yet decided whether she would seek a\nrollover of a portion of her shares in QAD, but that she was leaning in favor of rolling a portion of her shares\nin QAD as part of a potential transaction.\nOn May 17, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,\nas well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee) to discuss\nthe overall status of the process, as well as a potential process for involving Ms. Lopker in certain\ndiscussions with Thoma Bravo, Party B, or other potential counterparties that may submit indications of\ninterest. Representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed that, at the direction of the Special Committee, they\nwould schedule additional calls with Thoma Bravo and Party B to discuss further details of their respective\nindications of interest. At that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed status and\nfeedback received from the other potential counterparties involved in the process that did not submit\nindications of interest. After discussion and deliberation, representatives of Morgan Stanley confirmed that,\nat the direction of the Special Committee, they would request that any remaining parties in the process\nsubmit indications of interest by May 25, 2021. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of\nPaul, Weiss had further discussion during an executive session of the meeting.\nOver the course of the week of May 17, 2021, Messrs. Chilton and Lender, together with representatives of\nMorgan Stanley, continued to participate in due diligence discussions upon the request of potential\ncounterparties.\nOn May 19, 2021, and on May 21, 2021, Ms. Lopker had initial discussions with each of Party B and Thoma\nBravo, respectively, with representatives of Morgan Stanley present on behalf of the Special Committee, to\ndiscuss potential counterparties\u2019 plans for QAD and Ms. Lopker\u2019s potential involvement in QAD following\nthe closing of a potential transaction with each such counterparty. No discussion of any specific terms of\nsuch an arrangement, or a potential rollover of a portion of Ms. Lopker\u2019s shares in QAD, took place.\nFollowing these meetings, Ms. Lopker indicated to Messrs. Adelson and van Cuylenburg that she was open\nto further discussion with both of Thoma Bravo and Party B.\nOn May 21, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party\nD.\nOn May 25, 2021, of the seven potential counterparties who had been sent a process letter, Morgan Stanley\nreceived one additional written non-binding preliminary indication of interest, from two parties who\npartnered together, which we refer to collectively as Party E. Such indication of interest included a range of\n$80 to $82.50 per share, as well as a list of outstanding diligence items, and stated that any transaction would\nbe financed with a mix of debt and equity. Such indication of interest was promptly provided to the Special\nCommittee and its advisors. On May 25, 2021, QAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was\n$67.98.\nOn May 26, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting, with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan\nStanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special\n24 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCommittee). The Special Committee discussed with its advisors the preliminary indication of interest received\nfrom Party E, and, after deliberation and discussion, the Special Committee directed representatives of\nMorgan Stanley to inform Party E that the price included in its indication of interest was too low and it would\nneed to increase its offer price per share in order to proceed in the process.\nAt that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors also discussed feedback representatives of\nMorgan Stanley received from the five other parties who had been sent a process letter and requested to\nsubmit an indication of interest by May 25, 2021, but who did not submit an indication of interest.\nRepresentatives of Morgan Stanley advised that certain of such parties indicated that they may be interested\nin an at-market transaction with QAD, and were not willing to offer any premium to the then-current publicly-\ntraded market price. On May 26, 2021, QAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $67.64.\nAlso at that meeting, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors outreach to additional potential\ncounterparties. At the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley then proceeded\nto contact two additional potential counterparties, which we refer to as Party F and Party G, to gauge their\ninterest in participating in the process.\nOn May 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Special Committee its relationship\ndisclosure letter with respect to Party E and updated its prior disclosures with respect to each of Thoma\nBravo and Party B.\nOn May 28, 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley followed up\nwith Party D, which had not submitted any indication of interest, and encouraged Party D to continue\nconsidering a potential transaction with QAD. Party D indicated that it would no longer be participating in\nthe process.\nLater that week and over the course of the week of May 31, 2021, Messrs. Chilton and Lender, together with\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley, continued to participate in due diligence discussions upon the request of\npotential counterparties.\nOn June 1, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party F. Such confidentiality agreement\ndid not include any standstill provisions.\nOn June 2, 2021, Party C notified representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would no longer be participating\nin the process.\nOn June 3, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party F\nto provide background regarding QAD and its financial performance.\nOn June 7, 2021, the Special Committee met with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley, as well\nas Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss the\nstatus of the process and next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley stated that, after they had\ncontacted Party E to relay the Special Committee\u2019s message that Party E would need to increase its price in\norder to proceed in the process, Party E had responded that it would not increase its price, and that\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley should notify it if circumstances change and there would be an\nopportunity to move forward in Party E\u2019s proposed price range of $80 to $82.50 per share.\nAt that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors further discussed the status of Thoma Bravo,\nParty B and the other two remaining parties in the process. After discussion and deliberation, the Special\nCommittee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to communicate to all parties remaining in the process\nto submit final proposals with respect to a potential transaction with QAD by June 15, 2021.\nAlso during that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed the potential terms of a\ndraft merger agreement that was to be provided to bidders in connection with soliciting bids. The draft\nexpressly stated that if Ms. Lopker seeks to participate in a rollover of any of her shares, then, in addition to\nthe stockholder vote required by Delaware law, the Special Committee would further require that the majority\nof QAD\u2019s disinterested stockholders also approve the transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors\ndiscussed that this \u201cmajority of the minority\u201d vote would be a non-waivable condition for the transaction,\nand that such vote requirement would also be communicated to Ms. Lopker in the event she\n25 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsought to roll over any of her shares of QAD. The Special Committee and its advisors also discussed the\nterms of a support agreement, which would require, among other things, that the Lopker Entities vote in\nfavor of the contemplated transaction with the relevant counterparty (subject to certain exceptions), which\nthe parties participating in the process had continued to indicate they would require in connection with a\npotential transaction. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further\ndiscussion during an executive session of the meeting.\nOn June 7, 2021, Party F notified representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would no longer be participating\nin the process.\nOn June 8, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided a draft of the merger agreement to the potential\ncounterparties remaining in the process.\nOn June 9, 2021, QAD entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party G. Such confidentiality agreement\ndid not include any standstill provisions.\nOn June 11, 2021, Morgan Stanley, along with Messrs. Chilton and Lender met with representatives of Party\nG to provide background on QAD and its financial performance.\nOn June 12, 2021, representatives of Paul, Weiss sent a draft support agreement to Paul Hastings, legal\ncounsel to Ms. Lopker.\nOn June 14, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,\nas well as Mr. Chilton (who was present until excused by the Special Committee), to discuss the status of the\nprocess and potential next steps. Representatives of Morgan Stanley relayed that Thoma Bravo had\ncommunicated that, as a result of its further diligence, Thoma Bravo\u2019s final proposal that it would submit the\nnext day on June 15, 2021 would likely be at a lower price per share than the initial price of $90 per share set\nforth in its preliminary indication of interest submitted on May 11, 2021. After discussion and deliberation,\nthe Special Committee determined that it would review any proposals received with its advisors, and would\nseek to ensure the highest price possible.\nThe Special Committee and its advisors also discussed an approach regarding the Special Committee\u2019s\nreview of any proposals submitted on June 15, 2021, and determined that no terms should be shared with\nMs. Lopker until the Special Committee has reviewed such proposals with its advisors and has formed an\nindependent view on the proposals. The Special Committee also confirmed that it had made clear to Ms.\nLopker and the potential counterparties that the Special Committee must first agree to a price per share and\nany other terms that are fair to all stockholders with a potential counterparty before any negotiations may\ntake place between such counterparty and Ms. Lopker and that, if Ms. Lopker sought a rollover of any\nshares, then a vote of the majority of the minority of QAD stockholders would be required.\nOn June 15, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley received a proposal, including a revised draft merger\nagreement from Thoma Bravo, which it promptly shared with the Special Committee and its advisors. Thoma\nBravo\u2019s proposal lowered its offer price as compared to its earlier preliminary indication of interest\u202f-\u202ffrom $90\nper share to $85 per share, due to its view of findings in its recent diligence. Thoma Bravo\u2019s offer proposed\nthat Ms. Lopker may roll $150 million of her shares (valued at $85 per share) and explicitly stated that its\nproposal, including the price per share in connection with the merger, was not premised or conditioned on\nany rollover or the terms of such rollover. Thoma Bravo indicated that it was ready to execute a definitive\nagreement in as soon as 72 hours and only had confirmatory due diligence left to complete. On June 15, 2021\nQAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $77.00.\nOn June 16, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley received a proposal and representatives of Paul, Weiss\nreceived a revised draft merger agreement, each from Party B, which were promptly shared with the Special\nCommittee and its advisors. Party B\u2019s proposal included an offer price of approximately $86 per share, just as\nit had in its preliminary indication of interest. Party B\u2019s offer invited Ms. Lopker to roll a portion of her\nshares, stating that Party B proposed a minimum rollover of 30% and a maximum of 50% of Ms. Lopker\u2019s\nshares, and included a term sheet that described certain stockholder rights in connection with the securities\nMs. Lopker would receive in a rollover. Party B\u2019s proposal indicated that it had due diligence left to complete\nand would likely require about three more weeks before it would be in a position to execute a\n26 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndefinitive agreement, and that the terms of its offer remain subject to ongoing diligence. On June 16, 2021,\nQAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $78.03.\nAlso on June 16, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan\nStanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to\ndiscuss the latest proposals received. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee directed\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley to communicate to Thoma Bravo and Party B that they would need to\nincrease their respective offer prices, and also that Party B should proceed more quickly than communicated\nin its proposal. Morgan Stanley also relayed to Thoma Bravo that, subject to any future discussions with\nMs. Lopker, Thoma Bravo may need to consider altering the terms of their rollover proposal and the role Ms.\nLopker might play in the future. The Special Committee directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to\nreiterate to both Ms. Lopker and Thoma Bravo that a rollover of any of Ms. Lopker\u2019s shares would require a\n\u201cmajority of the minority\u201d stockholder vote, and such vote would be a non-waivable condition for the\nmerger. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion\nduring an executive session of the meeting.\nOn June 16, 2021, the Special Committee received a revised offer from Thoma Bravo. Thoma Bravo\u2019s revised\noffer maintained a purchase price of $85 per share, but indicated they were open to further discussion with\nregard to the amount of Ms. Lopker\u2019s rollover. Thoma Bravo also included an offer to have Ms. Lopker\ncontinue her involvement in QAD by forming and leading a strategic Advisory Board. On June 16, 2021, at\nthe direction of the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley shared the revised offer with Ms. Lopker.\nOver the course of the period from June 16, 2021 to June 21, 2021, and at the direction of the Special\nCommittee, representatives of Morgan Stanley had a number of discussions with each of Thoma Bravo and\nParty B, communicating that such parties should increase their respective offer prices and that Party B\nshould expedite timing to get to a definitive agreement.\nOn June 17, 2021, Mr. van Cuylenberg discussed the revised offer from Thoma Bravo with Ms. Lopker. As\npart of that discussion, Ms. Lopker shared with Mr. van Cuylenberg that the price was not as high as she\nwould want and that she would prefer a higher rollover and a more active role at the Company. Mr. van\nCuylenberg relayed Ms. Lopker\u2019s position to Morgan Stanley.\nOn June 18, 2021, at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley\ncommunicated to Thoma Bravo that the Special Committee requested that it increase its offer price to $92 per\nshare, which Thoma Bravo stated it was not willing to do. On June 18, 2021, QAD\u2019s closing share price of\nClass A Common Stock was $72.93. Morgan Stanley also relayed Ms. Lopker\u2019s preference for a higher\nrollover and a board seat to Thoma Bravo.\nOn June 18, 2021, Paul, Weiss sent the Company\u2019s disclosure letter and a revised draft of the merger\nagreement to legal counsel to Party B.\nOn June 18, 2021, after further discussion with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Thoma Bravo informed\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley that it was willing to increase its offer price to $87.50 per share, and\nindicated that this represented Thoma Bravo\u2019s best and final offer. Thoma Bravo also offered a potential\nrollover amount of up to $300 million for Ms. Lopker, as well as an offer of a board seat. Such revised offer\nwas promptly shared with the Special Committee and its advisors. On June 18, 2021, the last full trading day\nprior to June 19, 2021, QAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock was $72.93.\nOn June 19, 2021, Paul, Weiss sent the Company\u2019s disclosure letter and a revised draft of the merger\nagreement to Kirkland & Ellis LLP, legal counsel to Thoma Bravo, which we refer to as Kirkland & Ellis.\nOn June 19, 2021, Ms. Lopker informed the Special Committee that she had retained Moelis & Company as\nher financial advisor.\nOn June 20, 2021, Ms. Lopker met with representatives of Thoma Bravo, with representatives of Morgan\nStanley present on behalf of the Special Committee and representatives of Moelis present on behalf of Ms.\nLopker, to discuss, among other things, Thoma Bravo\u2019s approach for running QAD\u2019s business after the\nMerger and other terms Ms. Lopker was contemplating, including the possibility of Ms. Lopker purchasing\nQAD\u2019s headquarters property.\n27 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 21, 2021, as disclosed in a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on April 29, 2021, Mr.\nRoberts\u2019s term on the QAD Board (and therefore Special Committee) ended pursuant to the term set forth in\nthe bylaws of the Company, and he did not stand for reelection.\nOn June 21, 2021, Party B communicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that it was withdrawing its\noffer as it would not increase its price, which was still at approximately $86 per share, and nor would it\nexpedite the timeline for diligence. Such communication was promptly provided to the Special Committee and\nits advisors.\nOn June 21, 2021, Paul Hastings sent Paul, Weiss a revised draft of the support agreement. Later that day,\nPaul, Weiss sent a revised draft of the support agreement to Paul Hastings and to Kirkland & Ellis.\nAlso on June 21, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis sent a revised Company disclosure letter to Paul, Weiss.\nLater on June 21, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan\nStanley, as well as Messrs. Chilton and Lender (who were present until excused by the Special Committee), to\ndiscuss the status of the process. The Special Committee discussed potential steps it might take to persuade\nParty B to change its decision and re-engage in the process. Representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an\nupdate regarding Party G, the one additional potential counterparty still engaged in the process, noting that\nsuch party had not submitted an offer and had not indicated that it was interested in moving forward. Later\nthat day, representatives of Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Special Committee, again contacted Party\nG to encourage it to submit a bid.\nIn that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed Thoma Bravo\u2019s revised offer at\n$87.50 per share, including whether there was an opportunity to further increase the price given the\nnegotiations over the prior week and Thoma Bravo\u2019s statement that this was its \u201cbest and final\u201d offer. The\nSpecial Committee and its advisors also discussed the fairness of Thoma Bravo\u2019s proposal\u2019s price and terms\nto stockholders not affiliated with the Lopker Entities, and that it was an attractive offer. After further\ndiscussion and deliberation with its advisors, the Special Committee directed representatives of Morgan\nStanley to communicate to Thoma Bravo, that subject to other terms and conditions, the Special Committee\nwould be willing to recommend a transaction at $87.50 per share if such transaction included Thoma Bravo\nproviding a full equity commitment in connection with the financing of the transaction, and no financing\ncontingency. The members of the Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further\ndiscussion during an executive session of the meeting.\nLater on June 21, 2021, a representative of Paul, Weiss communicated to representatives of Paul Hastings\nand Kirkland & Ellis that they could now engage in discussions regarding a potential rollover and post-deal\narrangements.\nOn June 22, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss.\nLater on June 22, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis sent a proposed contribution and exchange agreement and equity\nterm sheet to Paul Hastings which was also shared with the Special Committee and its advisors. Such\ndocuments were intended to provide the terms and conditions of Ms. Lopker\u2019s rollover of certain of her QAD\nshares.\nOn June 23, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley, at the direction of the Special Committee, contacted\nParty G again to encourage it to submit a bid.\nOn June 24, 2021, Party G indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would no longer be\nparticipating in the process.\nOn June 24, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,\nto discuss the status of the process. The Special Committee also discussed Ms. Lopker\u2019s role at QAD\nfollowing the closing of the potential transaction with Thoma Bravo, and terms being negotiated between her\nand Thoma Bravo, including Ms. Lopker seeking that a certain amount of her shares participate in a rollover.\nThe Special Committee and its advisors discussed such topics as well as status of the draft merger\nagreement, key terms and other open issues.\n28 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 25, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and Morgan Stanley,\nto discuss the status of the process and open issues in the draft merger agreement and other transaction\ndocuments. Representatives of Morgan Stanley stated that, after extensive negotiations, Thoma Bravo\nindicated that it would agree to provide a full equity commitment in connection with the financing of the\ntransaction which would eliminate the need for Thoma Bravo to secure debt financing and enhance the\ncertainty of closing the proposed transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed the same,\nand the Special Committee directed Paul, Weiss to revise the documents to reflect, among other terms, such\nfull equity commitment and a supporting guarantee from TB Fund XIV L.P., an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, L.P.\nAt that same meeting, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed other developments in the market,\nincluding the recently announced proposed acquisition of Plex Systems by Rockwell Automation, including\nthe revenue multiple and other terms obtained in the Plex Systems transaction and discussed factors that\ndifferentiated Plex Systems from QAD, including, among other factors, Plex System\u2019s business in Industrial\nIOT, growth and margin profile, the fact that Plex Systems has 500 employees and its operations are U.S.-\nbased, and the synergies created through acquisition by a strategic counterparty. The members of the\nSpecial Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss had further discussion during an executive session of\nthe meeting.\nOn June 27, 2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Special Committee an updated\nrelationship disclosure letter with respect to Thoma Bravo.\nDuring the course of the day on June 27, 2021, the Special Committee, the Company and Thoma Bravo and\ntheir respective representatives exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement and related transaction\ndocuments and schedules, and engaged in related negotiations.\nAlso during the course of the day on June 27, 2021, the Special Committee, the Company, Thoma Bravo and\nMs. Lopker and their respective representatives exchanged multiple drafts of the support agreement and\nengaged in related negotiations.\nSeparately, during the day on June 27, 2021, Ms. Lopker and Thoma Bravo and their respective\nrepresentatives exchanged multiple drafts of the contribution and exchange agreement and related\ndocuments, which were also shared with the Special Committee and its advisors.\nLater in the day on June 27, 2021, the Special Committee met, along with representatives of Paul, Weiss and\nMorgan Stanley, and Mr. Chilton.

announcing the signing of the Merger Agreement with an affiliate of Thoma Bravo.\nPurpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the QAD Board and the Special Committee\u037e\nFairness of the Merger\nAs described in the section entitled \u201cBackground of the Merger,\u201d the QAD Board duly established the\nSpecial Committee and delegated to it the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review\nand evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of any potential transactions with\nrespect to the Company and any alternatives thereto, (ii) negotiate with the counterparties to any such\npotential transaction or any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms\nand conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives thereto and, if the Special Committee\ndeems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of\ndocuments pertaining to a given transaction or any alternative transaction on behalf of the Company, (iii)\ndetermine whether such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee\nis fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and all of its stockholders (and to the extent Ms. Lopker\nis determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other\nshareholders, other than Ms. Lopker), (iv) recommend to the full QAD Board what action, if any, should be\ntaken by the QAD Board with respect to such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto, and (v) retain\nindependent legal counsel and such other consultants and agents, including, without limitation, independent\ninvestment bankers, as the Special Committee deems necessary or appropriate to perform such services and\nrender such opinions as may be necessary or appropriate in order for the Special Committee to discharge its\nduties.\nThe Special Committee, acting with the advice and assistance of its independent legal and financial advisors,\nevaluated and negotiated the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, and after careful consideration, at a meeting of the Special Committee held on June 27, 2021, the\nSpecial Committee, among other things, unanimously:\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company\u2019s\nstockholders\u037e\nrecommended that the QAD Board approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, and declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders\u037e and\n30 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022

the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger.\nOn June 27, 2021, after careful consideration, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special\nCommittee, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself), pursuant to resolutions adopted at\na meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself), among other things:\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company\u2019s\nstockholders\u037e\nadopted and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including\nthe Merger\u037e\ndirected that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption and\napproval\u037e and\nresolved to recommend that the holders of Shares vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve\nthe transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.\nAccordingly, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nMerger Agreement Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger, at the Special Meeting.\nIn considering the recommendations of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with\nrespect to the Merger, you should be aware that executive officers and directors have certain interests in the\nMerger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders generally.\nThe Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and the QAD Board were aware of\nthese interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making its decision to recommend that the\nQAD Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including\nthe Merger. For more information about these interests, refer to the section entitled \u201cInterests of Executive\nOfficers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.\u201d The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other\nthan Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) believe that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger, are fair to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Stockholders.\nThe Special Committee engaged its own independent legal and financial advisors and received advice\nthroughout the negotiations from such advisors. Since the members of the Special Committee are\ndisinterested with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, independent of, and\nnot affiliated with, the Parent Entities or the Lopker Entities, the Special Committee believed that it could\neffectively represent the interests of the Unaffiliated Stockholders in negotiating the terms of the Merger\nAgreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making its decision to\nrecommend that the QAD Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger.\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and\nmaking the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the\nQAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) considered, among other things, the following\npotentially positive factors, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative\norder of importance:\nthe current and historical market prices of the Shares, including as set forth in the table under \u201cOther\nImportant

opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take\nwith respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.\nThe Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) concluded that,\noverall, the potentially positive factors outweighed the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfactors relevant to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.\nAccordingly, the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)\ndetermined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger are\nadvisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nAccordingly, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the\nMerger Agreement Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger, at the Special Meeting.\nIn the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger, and making the decisions, determinations and recommendations described above, the Special\nCommittee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not consider the liquidation\nvalue of the Company because (i) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (ii) they\nbelieved that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concerns,\n(iii) they considered determining a liquidation value to be impracticable given the significant execution risk\ninvolved in any breakup of the Company and (iv) the Company will continue to operate its business\nfollowing the Merger. For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms.\nLopker, who recused herself) did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant methodology. Further, the\nSpecial Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not consider net\nbook value, which is an accounting concept, as a factor because they believe that net book value is not a\nmaterial indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical costs\nand because net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions,\ntrends in the industry in which the Company operates or the business risks inherent in that industry. The\nSpecial Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not seek to\ndetermine a pre-Merger going concern value for the Shares to determine the fairness of the Merger\nConsideration to the Company\u2019s stockholders. The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms.\nLopker, who recused herself) believe that the trading price of the Shares at any given time represents the\nbest available indicator of the Company\u2019s going concern value at that time so long as the trading price at\nthat time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. The Special\nCommittee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) carefully considered the advice\nand opinion of Morgan Stanley. Although the reference to the Company\u2019s stockholders in the opinion of\nMorgan Stanley did not exclude the Company\u2019s directors and officers (other than those affiliated with the\nLopker Entities) notwithstanding that such persons are deemed affiliates of the Company, such reference did\nnot affect the determination of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who\nrecused herself) in respect of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including\nthe Merger, because such directors and officers will receive the same Merger Consideration as Unaffiliated\nStockholders.\nThe Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) are not aware of\nany firm offer for a merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company\u2019s assets, or a purchase of a\ncontrolling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company from anyone other than\na filing person in the two (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement\nThe foregoing discussion is not exhaustive, but is intended to summarize the material information and factors\nconsidered by the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) in\ntheir consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger. The Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) reached\nthe decision to approve the entry into the Merger Agreement and recommend its adoption by the Company\u2019s\nstockholders in light of the factors described above and other factors that the Special Committee and the\nQAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) believed were appropriate. In view of the variety of\nfactors and the quality and amount of information considered, the Special Committee and the QAD Board\n(other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) did not find it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise\nassign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching their determinations. In addition, each\nof the directors of the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)\nmay have given different weight to different factors. The Special Committee and the QAD Board conducted\nan overall review of the factors described above, including through discussions with the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and their respective legal and financial advisors, and considered the factors overall to be\nfavorable to, and to support, their decisions, determinations and recommendations.

It was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a\nrecommendation as to how the Company\u2019s stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting with respect to the Merger\nor any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information\nof QAD\u037e\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning\nQAD\u037e\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of QAD (as more fully defined\nherein, the \u201cManagement Case\u201d) and certain extrapolations prepared with guidance from the\nmanagement of QAD (which were reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by the\nmanagement of QAD) (as more fully defined herein, the \u201cFinancial Projections\u201d)\u037e\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of QAD with\nsenior executives of QAD\u037e\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Class A Common Stock\u037e\ncompared the financial performance of QAD and the prices and trading activity of the Shares with\nthat of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with QAD, and their securities\u037e\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition\ntransactions\u037e\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of QAD, Parent and their\nrespective financial and legal advisors\u037e\nreviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of June 27, 2021, a draft of the Equity Commitment\nLetter, substantially in the form of the drafted June 26, 2021, and certain related documents\u037e and\n40 \u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors\nas Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the\naccuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made\navailable to Morgan Stanley by QAD and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the\nFinancial Projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting\nthe best currently available estimates and judgments of QAD\u2019s management of the future financial\nperformance of QAD. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such Financial Projections or the\nassumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be\nconsummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver,\namendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among other things, that Parent will obtain\nfinancing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, and that the definitive\nMerger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan\nStanley. In addition, Morgan Stanley understood from QAD that, pursuant to Article IV of QAD\u2019s Certificate\nof Incorporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock must receive an amount and form of consideration\nper share that is no less favorable than the consideration per share received by the holders of the Class B\nCommon Stock in the event of a merger, business combination or consolidation of QAD, including the\nMerger. Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to the allocation of Merger Consideration between the Class\nA Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, or the relative fairness of any portion of the Merger\nConsideration to holders of any Shares. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all\nthe necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger,\nno delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on\nthe contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax\nor regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent\nverification, the assessment of QAD and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or\nregulatory matters. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as\ncompared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such\nalternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the\nfairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of QAD\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or\nany class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Shares\n(other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the Merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent\nvaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of QAD, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such\nvaluations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market\nand other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of June 27,\n2021. Events occurring after June 27, 2021 may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in\npreparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with\nits oral opinion and the preparation of its written opinion letter dated June 27, 2021 to the Special Committee.\nThe following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses\nperformed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of\nanalyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these\nsummaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand\nthe financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each\nsummary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses\nlisted in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such\nanalyses and of the factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized\nand relied upon (i) the Management Case and (ii) the consensus estimates of equity research analysts (the\n\u201cStreet Case\u201d). The Management Case is more fully described below in the sections of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c- Public Trading Comparables Analysis,\u201d \u201c- Discounted Equity Value Analysis\u201d and\n41 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201c- Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.\u201d In accordance with direction from the Special Committee, Morgan\nStanley utilized the Street Case and Management Case in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Comparables Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value\nof a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and\ncompared certain financial estimates for QAD with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst\nresearch estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and\nexperience, that share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics,\nincluding, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations,\nprofitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to as the\n\u201ccomparable companies\u201d). These companies were the following:\nERP Business Model Peer Companies \nOracle Corporation \nSAP SE \nSage Group plc \nFinancial Profile Peer Companies \nVertex Software, LLC \nZuora Inc. \nAlarm.com \nNew Relic, Inc. \n8x8, Inc. \nBox, Inc. \nGoDaddy Inc. Yext Inc. \nVonage Holdings Corp. \nTeradata Corporation \nGlobal Supply Chain Peer Companies \nManhattan Associates, Inc. \nDescartes Systems Group Inc. \nKinaxis Inc. \nSPS Commerce, Inc. \nE2open, LLC\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to (i) estimated revenue\nand (ii) EBITDA, both of which, for purposes of this analysis, (a) for QAD, (x) were provided to Morgan\nStanley, and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use, by QAD\u2019s management for calendar years 2021 and 2022\nfor the Management Case, and (y) were based on the median of publicly available equity analyst research\nestimates for calendar years 2021 and 2022 for the Street Case\u037e and (b) for each of the comparable companies,\nwere based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for comparison purposes. For\npurposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully diluted equity\nvalue plus total debt, plus non-controlling interest, less cash and cash equivalents, and \u201cEBITDA\u201d as\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.\nBased on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application\nof its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of (i) aggregate\nvalue to estimated revenue multiples and (ii) aggregate value to estimated EBITDA multiples, and applied\nthese ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for QAD. For purposes of this analysis, Morgan\nStanley utilized publicly available financial information, available as of June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day\nprior to the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt\nthe Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger).\nBased on the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis as provided by QAD\u2019s management, Morgan\nStanley calculated the estimated implied value per Share as follows:\n42 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPublic Trading Multiples\nSelected\nComparable \nQAD Multiple \nRanges\nImplied Value\nPer \nShare ($)\nCY 2021E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n51.56\u202f-\u202f95.79\nManagement Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n51.71\u202f-\u202f96.10\nCY 2022E AV / Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f5.5x\n55.31\u202f-\u202f95.28\nManagement Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f5.5x\n56.50\u202f-\u202f97.47\nCY 2021E AV / EBITDA\nStreet Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n30.63\u202f-\u202f54.30\nManagement Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n31.28\u202f-\u202f55.59\nCY 2022E AV / EBITDA\nStreet Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f25.0x\n36.64\u202f-\u202f56.40\nManagement Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f25.0x\n32.74\u202f-\u202f49.93\nNo company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to QAD. In evaluating the\ncomparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,\ngeneral business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are\nbeyond QAD\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on QAD\u2019s business\nand the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial\ncondition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical\nanalysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using\ncomparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the\npotential future equity value of a company as a function of such company\u2019s estimated future revenue and\nEBITDA. The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied\npresent value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity\nvalues per Share on a standalone basis for each of the Street Case and Management Case.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized (i) calendar year 2023\nrevenue estimates and (ii) calendar year 2023 EBITDA estimates under each of the Street Case and\nManagement Case, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience,\nMorgan Stanley applied a forward range of aggregate value to (i) estimated revenue multiples, and (ii)\nEBITDA multiples (based on the range of aggregate value to revenue and EBITDA multiples for the\ncomparable companies) to these revenue and EBITDA estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future\nimplied fully diluted equity value.\nIn each case, Morgan Stanley then added net cash to QAD\u2019s future implied aggregate value to reach a future\nimplied fully diluted equity value. In each case, Morgan Stanley then divided the future implied fully diluted\nequity value by estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (with such estimates provided by QAD\nmanagement) to calculate a per share price. Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future\nshare price to June 30, 2021, at a discount rate of 8.1%, which rate was selected based on QAD\u2019s estimated\ncost of equity, which was arrived at by applying the capital asset pricing model, to calculate the discounted\nfully diluted equity value.\nBased on Calendar Year 2023\nSelected AV / \nEstimated\nRevenue \nMultiple Ranges\nImplied Value\nPer \nShare ($)\nEstimated Revenue\nStreet Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n53.26\u202f-\u202f97.33\nManagement Case\n3.0x\u202f-\u202f6.0x\n55.11\u202f-\u202f101.21\nEstimated EBITDA\nStreet Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n38.68\u202f-\u202f68.46\nManagement Case\n15.0x\u202f-\u202f30.0x\n38.02\u202f-\u202f67.14\n43 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of\na company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such\ncompany. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per Share based on a discounted\ncash flow analysis to value QAD as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the Street\nCase and Management Case for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described\nbelow.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as EBITDA less (1)\nstock-based compensation expense, (2) cash taxes, (3) capital expenditures, and plus or minus changes in net\nworking capital. Each of the Street Case and Management Case included extrapolations through calendar\nyear 2030 prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use by QAD\u2019s management. The\nfree cash flows and terminal values were discounted, using a mid-year convention, to present values as of\nJune 30, 2021, at a discount rate ranging from 7.1% to 9.1%, which discount rates were selected, upon the\napplication of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of QAD\u2019s\nweighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the capital asset pricing model. Morgan\nStanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 2.0% to 3.0% as part of its analyses, with such rates selected upon\nthe application of Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value\nwas then adjusted for net cash and further adjusted for the net present value of net operating losses.\nBased on the outstanding Share on a fully diluted basis as provided by QAD\u2019s management, Morgan Stanley\ncalculated the estimated implied value per Share as follows:\nImplied Value\nPer \nShare ($)\nStreet Case\n53.41\u202f-\u202f88.61\nManagement Case\n66.06\u202f-\u202f109.92\nPrecedent Transactions Multiples Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of\na company based on publicly available financial terms. Morgan Stanley selected such comparable\ntransactions because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably because they were\nsimilar software transactions. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value\nof the transaction to (i) the estimated next twelve (12) months\u2019 (which we refer to as \u201cNTM\u201d) revenue, and (ii)\nthe NTM EBITDA, each based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of each such\ntransaction.\n44 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe following is a list of the selected software transactions reviewed, together with the applicable multiples:\nSelected Software Transactions (Target/Acquiror)\nAV / NTM\nRevenue\nAV / NTM\nEBITDA\nAthenahealth, Inc. / Veritas Capital and Evergreen Coast Capital\n3.9x\n14.1x\nAVG Technologies N.V. / Avast Software\n3.3x\n9.0x\nBarracuda Networks, Inc. / Thoma Bravo, L.P.\n3.8x\n19.6x\nCA Technologies / Broadcom Inc.\n4.3x\n10.8x\nCallidus Software Inc. / SAP SE\n8.3x\n52.0x\nCarbon Black, Inc. / VMware, Inc.\n8.0x\nN.M.\nCarbonite, Inc. / Open Text Corp.\n2.7x\n9.9x\nCision Ltd. / Platinum Equity, LLC\n3.5x\n9.9x\nCloudera, Inc. / Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC and KKR & Co.\n5.3x\n20.1x\nEllie Mae Inc. / Thoma Bravo, L.P.\n6.8x\n24.5x\nEndurance International Group Holdings, Inc. / Clearlake Capital Group\nLP\n2.7x\n9.9x\nForescout Technologies / Advent International Corporation and\nCrosspoint Capital Partners LP\n4.9x\nN.M.\nGigamon Inc. / Elliot Management Corporation\n3.7x\n17.1x\nImperva, Inc. / Thoma Bravo, L.P.\n4.7x\n41.1x\nInfoblox Inc. / Vista Equity Partners, LLC\n3.6x\n26.2x\nLifeLock, Inc. / NortonLifeLock Inc.

These include, among other things, the impact of\ncompetition on QAD\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any\nadverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the\nfinancial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate\nvalue and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that\npoints in\n45 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe range of implied present value per share of QAD derived from the valuation of precedent transactions\nwere less than or greater than the Merger Consideration is not necessarily dispositive in connection with\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s analysis of the consideration for the Merger, but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley\nconsidered.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial\nanalysis with respect to its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Special Committee,\nincluding the following information described under the sections of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-\nIllustrative Precedent Premiums,\u201d \u201c- Historical Trading Ranges\u201d and \u201c- Equity Research Analysts\u2019 Future\nPrice Targets.\u201d\nIllustrative Precedent Premiums\nMorgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent premiums analysis by reviewing the same sets of\ncomparable transactions as under the Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis. For these transactions,\nMorgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (1) the implied\npremium to the acquired company\u2019s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the\nlast trading day prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news)\u037e\n(2) the implied premium to the acquired company\u2019s thirty (30)-trading-day average closing share price prior to\nannouncement (or the last thirty (30)-trading-day average closing share price prior to the share price being\naffected by acquisition rumors or similar Merger-related news)\u037e and (3) the implied premium to the acquired\ncompany\u2019s fifty two (52)-week high closing share price prior to announcement.\nBased on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional\njudgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected a representative range of premia and applied such range\nto QAD\u2019s closing share price of Class A Common Stock on June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the\nmeeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the Merger\nAgreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the Merger).\nThe following table summarizes such calculation:\nPremia\nRepresentative\nRanges\nImplied Value\nPer \nshare of Class A\nCommon Stock\n($)\nPremia to 1-Day Unaffected Share Price\n20%\u202f-\u202f40%\n87.48\u202f-\u202f102.06\nPremia to 30-Day Unaffected Average Share Price\n20%\u202f-\u202f40%\n86.54\u202f-\u202f100.97\nPremia to 52-Week High Unaffected Share Price\n(15)%\u202f-\u202f18%\n66.80\u202f-\u202f93.10\nHistorical Trading Ranges\nMorgan Stanley noted certain trading ranges with respect to the historical share prices of Class A Common\nStock. Morgan Stanley reviewed a range of closing prices of the Class A Common Stock for various periods\nending on June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms.\nLopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the\nMerger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger). Morgan\nStanley observed the following:\nPeriods Ended June 25, 2021\nRange of Trading Prices Per share of\nClass A \nCommon Stock ($)\nLast 30 Days\n63.86\u202f-\u202f79.00\nLast 90 Days\n59.98\u202f-\u202f79.00\nLast 365 Days\n38.98\u202f-\u202f79.00\nEquity Research Analysts\u2019 Future Price Targets\nMorgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for Class A Common Stock prepared\nand published by equity research analysts prior to June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior to\n46 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the\nMerger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger). These targets reflected each analyst\u2019s estimate of the future\npublic market trading price of Class A Common Stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for\nthe Class A Common Stock was $75.00 to $82.00 per share as of May 26, 2021 to May 27, 2021. Morgan\nStanley discounted the range of analyst price targets per share of Class A Common Stock by one (1) year at a\nrate of 8.1%, which discount rate was selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional\njudgment and experience, to reflect QAD\u2019s cost of equity. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully\ndiluted equity values for shares of Class A Common Stock of $69.38 to $75.85 per share, as discounted by\none (1) year based on undiscounted analyst price targets, as of June 25, 2021 (the last full trading day prior\nto the meeting of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) to approve and adopt the\nMerger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger).\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect\ncurrent market trading prices for the Shares, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the\nfuture financial performance of QAD and future financial market conditions.\nPreliminary Presentations by Morgan Stanley\nIn addition to its June 27, 2021 opinion and presentation to the Special Committee and the underlying\nfinancial analyses performed in relation thereto, Morgan Stanley also delivered preliminary presentation\nmaterials to the Special Committee on June 25, 2021 (the \u201cPreliminary Presentation Materials\u201d). The\npreliminary financial considerations and other information in the Preliminary Presentation Materials were\nbased on information and data that was available as of the date of such presentation. The Preliminary\nPresentation Materials delivered at the QAD Board meeting on June 25, 2021 substantively reflected the\nanalyses described above under \u201c- Summary of Financial Analyses.\u201d A copy of such Preliminary\nPresentation Materials has been filed as an exhibit to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection\nwith the Merger, will be made available for inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of QAD\nduring its regular business hours by any interested holder of Shares, and may be obtained by requesting it in\nwriting from QAD at the address described in the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings\nor make any recommendations or constitute an opinion of Morgan Stanley with respect to the fairness of the\nMerger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in relation to its\nopinion dated June 27, 2021, as described above under \u201c- Summary of Financial Analyses,\u201d superseded all\nanalyses and information presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Morgan Stanley performed a variety\nof financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial\nopinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not\nattribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting\nany portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of\nthe process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various\nanalyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various\nassumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting\nfrom any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s view of the actual\nvalue of QAD.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,\nmany of which are beyond QAD\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on\nQAD\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material\nchange in the financial condition and prospects of QAD and the industry, and in the financial markets in\n47 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ngeneral. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future\nresults or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such\nestimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the Merger Consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders (other\nthan the holders of the Excluded Shares) in the aggregate pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in\nconnection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of June 27, 2021 to the Special Committee. These\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Shares might actually trade.\nThe Merger Consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than the holders of the\nExcluded Shares) in the aggregate pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm\u2019s-length\nnegotiations between QAD and Parent and was approved by the Special Committee. Morgan Stanley\nprovided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any\nspecific consideration to QAD or the Special Committee, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific\nconsideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did\nnot address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or\nother alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Special Committee was one of many factors taken into\nconsideration by the Special Committee to recommend that the QAD Board approve and adopt the Merger\nAgreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the\nopinion of the Special Committee with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of\nwhether the Special Committee would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other\nprofessionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nThe Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nqualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in QAD\u2019s\nindustry, and its knowledge of QAD\u2019s business and affairs. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm\nengaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its\nsecurities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange,\ncommodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing\nand financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest\non a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may\ntrade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their\ncustomers, in debt or equity securities or loans of QAD, Parent, TB UGP and their respective affiliates, or any\nother company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative\ninstrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Special Committee financial advisory\nservices and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex D, in\nconnection with the Merger, and QAD has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $27 million\nfor its services, $3 million of which has been paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section\nand attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and the remainder of which is contingent upon the\nconsummation of the Merger. QAD has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including\nfees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In\naddition, QAD has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers,\ndirectors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its\naffiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan\nStanley\u2019s engagement, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nIn the two (2) years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have\nprovided financial advisory and financing services for TB UGP and certain of its affiliates and their affiliated\nfunds\u2019 respective portfolio companies (collectively, the \u201cThoma Bravo Related Entities\u201d), and have received\naggregate fees of approximately $25 to $35 million in connection with such services.

Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and\nfinancing services to QAD, Parent, TB UGP and Thoma Bravo Related Entities and their respective affiliates\nin the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nPosition of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger\nUnder a possible interpretation of the SEC rules governing \u201cgoing private\u201d transactions, the Parent Entities\nmay be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and engaged in a \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction and, therefore,\nmay be required to express their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated\nStockholders. The Parent Entities are making the statements included in this section solely for purposes of\ncomplying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act.\nHowever, the view of the Parent Entities as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a\nrecommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities have interests in the Merger that are different from, and in\naddition to, those of the other stockholders of the Company.\nThe Parent Entities did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the QAD Board (other\nthan Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or other\nadvisors of the Special Committee or the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) as to, the\nfairness of the Merger. The Parent Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform,\nany valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the Company\u2019s\nUnaffiliated Stockholders. Based on, among other things, the factors considered by, and the analysis and\nresulting conclusions of, the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) and the Special\nCommittee discussed in \u201c- Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the\nQAD Board and the Special Committee\u037e Fairness of the Merger\u201d  (which analysis and resulting conclusions\nthe Parent Entities adopt), the Parent Entities believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the Company\u2019s\nUnaffiliated Stockholders. In particular, the Parent Entities considered the following:\nthe fact that no member of the Company\u2019s senior management other than Ms. Lopker, Mr. Chilton and\nMr. Lender has a substantial financial interest in the Merger that is different from, or in addition to,\nthe interests of the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Stockholders generally, although the Merger Agreement\ndoes include customary provisions for indemnity and the continuation of liability insurance for the\nCompany\u2019s officers and directors\u037e\nthe fact that the Special Committee and the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself)\nunanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders\u037e\nthe fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing stockholders (other than the Lopker\nEntities) to immediately realize a certain and fair value for their Shares, which value represents a\nsignificant premium over the closing price of the Shares on the last trading day before the Company\npublicly announced the Merger\u037e\nthe fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Stockholders without\nthe delays that would otherwise be necessary in order to liquidate the positions of larger holders, and\nwithout incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales\u037e and\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nthe fact that there are no unusual requirements or conditions to the Merger and that the Merger is not\nconditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will\nbe consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Stockholders in\nthe Merger will be received.\nThe Parent Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated\nStockholders

under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights,\nwhich allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Shares.\nThe Parent Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the\nsubstantive and procedural fairness of the proposed Merger, including:\nthat the stockholders of the Company (other than the Lopker Entities) will not participate in any\nfuture earnings or growth of the Company\u2019s business and will not benefit from any potential sale to a\nthird party in the future, or from any appreciation in the

Merger,\ncould have on the Company\u2019s business and relationships with its employees, vendors and\ncustomers\u037e\nthat the Company and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, initiating, or encouraging the\nsubmission of alternative acquisition proposals from third parties or the making of any inquiry,\nproposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal\u037e\nthe possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the\nMerger Agreement, including payment to Parent of a Company Termination Fee of $59,000,000 in cash,\nand the processes required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the opportunity for Parent\nto make revisions to its Merger proposal, could discourage other potential acquirors from making a\ncompeting bid to acquire the Company\u037e and\nthe fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to the Company\u2019s stockholders (other than the\nLopker Entities with respect to their Rollover Shares) that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes.\nThe Parent Entities did not consider the liquidation value of the Company because they considered the\nCompany to be a viable, going concern that will continue to operate its business following the Merger.\nTherefore, the Parent Entities did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant methodology. The Parent\nEntities did not seek to determine a pre-Merger going concern value for the Shares to determine the fairness\nof the Merger Consideration to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Stockholders because, following the Merger, the\nCompany will have a significantly different capital structure. The Parent Entities note that the Merger\nConsideration of $87.50 in cash per Share is higher than the net book value of the Company per Share of\n$6.43 as of April 30, 2021. However, to the extent the pre-Merger going concern value was reflected in the\npre-announcement per Share price of the Shares, the per Share Merger Consideration of $87.50 represented a\npremium to the going concern value of the Company. The Parent Entities were not aware of any firm offer for\na merger, sale of all or a substantial part of the Company\u2019s assets, or a purchase of a controlling amount of\nthe Company securities having been received by the Company from anyone other than a filing person in the\ntwo (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Parent Entities\nin connection with the fairness of the Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all\nmaterial factors considered by them. The Parent Entities did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or\notherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of\nthe Merger. Rather, the Parent Entities reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after\nconsidering all of the foregoing as a whole. The Parent Entities believe these factors provide a reasonable\nbasis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated\nStockholders. This position should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company\nstockholder to approve the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities make no recommendation as to how\nstockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger.\nNone of the Parent Entities participated in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the QAD Board\n(other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) regarding, nor received advice from the respective legal or\nother advisors of the Special Committee or the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) as\nto, the fairness of the Merger to the Company\u2019s Unaffiliated Stockholders.

The projections were not prepared with a\nview toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP (as detailed below), the\npublished guidelines of the SEC regarding projections, the use of non-GAAP financial measures or the\nguidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective\nfinancial information, but, in the view of the Company\u2019s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis,\nreflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation and presented as of the time\nof preparation, to the best of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the reasonable projections\nof the future financial performance of the Company.\nNeither the Company\u2019s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled,\nexamined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained\nherein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its\nachievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial\ninformation.\nThe projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables\nand assumptions that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement. Because the projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they also become subject to\ngreater uncertainty with each successive year. A number of important factors with respect to the Company\u2019s\nbusiness and the industry in which it participates may affect actual results and result in the projections not\nbeing achieved. For a description of some of these factors, the Company\u2019s stockholders are urged to review\nthe Company\u2019s most recent SEC filings as well as the discussion entitled \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\u201d and other risk factors described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2021, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nIn addition, the projections may be affected by the Company\u2019s inability to achieve strategic goals, objectives\nand targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results\nare indicative of the future performance of the Company or that actual results will not differ materially from\nthose presented in the prospective financial information.\n57 ",

Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or\nrepresentatives has made or makes any representation to any of the Company\u2019s stockholders or any other\nperson regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the\nprojections or can give any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and\nnone of them undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect\ncircumstances existing after the date the projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future\nevents even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in\nerror. The Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the\nprojections, except as otherwise required by law.\nThe projections include non-GAAP financial measures, and they were presented because management\nbelieved they could be useful indicators of the Company\u2019s projected future operating performance. The\nCompany prepared the projections on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP,\nand non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled\namounts used by other companies. As used herein, \u201cGAAP\u201d means generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nAll financial projections are forward looking statements. These and other forward looking statements are\nexpressly qualified in their entirety by the risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary\nstatements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021,\nand subsequent quarterly and current reports on Form 10-Q and 8-K. Please consider carefully the\ndiscussion entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Information\u201d elsewhere in the\nproxy statement.\nIn light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the projections, the Company\u2019s stockholders are\ncautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the projections.\nThe following is a summary of the projections (unaudited):\n(Dollars in millions)\nFY2022E\nFY2023E\nFY2024E\nFY2025E\nFY2026E\nFY2027E\nFY2028E\nFY2029E\nFY2030E\nFY2031E\nRevenue\n$\n336\n$\n373\n$\n421\n$\n491\n$\n584\n$\n707\n$\n824\n$\n924\n$\n997\n$ 1,032\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n37\n$\n39\n$\n53\n$\n76\n$\n109\n$\n146\n$\n173\n$\n197\n$\n216\n$\n227\nFor the purposes of the financial analyses as described above under the heading \u201c- Opinion of Morgan\nStanley & Co. LLC,\u201d fiscal year projections are treated as the prior calendar year projections (e.g.,\nFY2022E (ended January) is equivalent to CY2021E (ended December)).\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other\ncompanies and excludes the following items: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,\nrestructuring, separation, transaction and integration-related cost and other non-recurring items.\nAdjusted EBITDA differs from Reported Adjusted EBITDA because Reported Adjusted EBITDA does\nnot include expenses associated with stock-based compensation.\nInterests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendations of the QAD Board (other than Ms. Lopker, who recused herself) with\nrespect to the Merger, the Company\u2019s stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors\nhave certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the\nCompany\u2019s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and\nthe QAD Board were aware of these interests and considered the interests described below, among other\nmatters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the\nMerger and in making its recommendations.\nSpecial Committee Fees\nEach of the members of the Special Committee, consisting of directors who are not directly or indirectly\naffiliated with, and who are otherwise independent from, Ms. Lopker and who are not members\n58 \n(1)\n(2)TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof the Company\u2019s management or otherwise interested in the Merger, will receive a fee of $20,000 per month\nfor each month that the Special Committee is in effect, beginning in March 2021, in connection with their\nservices to the Company with respect to the Merger (which fee is not conditioned on the consummation of\nthe Merger). The fees to members of the Special Committee are expected to total between $500,000 and\n$600,000.\nPayments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards\nUpon the Effective Time of the Merger, each Company SAR, Company RSU and Company PSU will be\nconverted into the right to receive cash payments based upon the Merger Consideration as described below.\nAs of September 7, 2021, the Company\u2019s executive officers hold 902,500 vested Company SARs, 47,500\nunvested Company SARs, 199,374 Company RSUs, and 94,872 Company PSUs.

At the Effective Time of the Merger, each Vested Company SAR, will be cancelled\nand automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the\naggregate number of Shares subject to such Vested Company SAR multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the\nMerger Consideration over the applicable per Share base price of such Vested Company SAR, subject to any\nrequired withholding of taxes. Amounts payable in respect of the cancelled Vested Company SARs will be\npaid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later than five (5) days following\nthe Effective Time of the Merger).\nUnvested Company SARs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding Unvested Company SAR\nwill be cancelled and replaced with a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the\nproduct of (A) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company SAR multiplied by (B)\nthe excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share base price of such Unvested\nCompany SAR, and such amount will be payable in accordance with such Unvested Company SAR\u2019s vesting\nterms.\nVested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each (i) Vested\nCompany RSU and (ii) Vested Company PSU will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to\nreceive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of Shares subject to the Vested\nCompany RSU and/or Vested Company PSU (with Company PSUs granted in 2019 earned based on actual\nperformance achieved through the Effective Time and Company PSUs granted in 2021 deemed earned at\n100% of target level of performance), multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, subject to any required\nwithholding of taxes. Amounts payable in respect of the cancelled Vested Company RSUs and cancelled\nVested Company PSUs will be paid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later\nthan five (5) days following the Effective Time of the Merger). For purposes of clarity, 50% of the Company\nRSUs and Company PSUs held by each of Anton Chilton, Pamela M. Lopker and Daniel Lender that are\noutstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will vest in accordance with the terms\nof their respective CIC Agreement (as defined below) and will be treated as Vested Company RSUs and\nVested Company PSUs and payable promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger.\nUnvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each tranche\nof Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs will be cancelled and replaced with a right to\nreceive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the amount of the Merger Consideration multiplied\nby (B) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company\nPSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (with Company PSUs granted in 2019 earned\nbased on actual performance achieved through the Effective Time of the Merger and Company PSUs granted\nin 2021 deemed earned at 100% of target level of performance) (the \u201cCash Replacement Company RSU/PSU\nAmounts\u201d).\nFor each tranche of cancelled Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs, except as otherwise\nprovided by the terms of the Merger Agreement, 50% of the Cash Replacement Company RSU/\u200bPSU Amounts,\nsubject to any required withholding of taxes, will be paid promptly following the Effective Time of the Merger\n(and in no case later than five (5) days following the Effective Time of the Merger).\n59 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExcept as otherwise provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the remaining 50% of the Cash\nReplacement Company RSU/PSU Amounts for each tranche of cancelled Unvested Company RSUs and\nUnvested Company PSUs will vest, subject to the holder\u2019s continued service with Parent and its affiliates\n(including the surviving Company and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, subject to any\nrequired withholding of taxes, at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company PSUs\nfor which such Cash Replacement Company RSU/PSU Amount were exchanged, would have vested pursuant\nto their terms or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment by the Company without cause or a\nresignation by the holder for good reason (as described in the Merger Agreement).\nFor purposes of clarity and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding\nparagraph, 50% of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs held by each of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr.\nLender that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will be treated as\nUnvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs and will be converted into the Cash Replacement\nCompany RSU/PSU Amounts as described above\u037e however, such amounts will vest and be payable in\naccordance with the terms of their respective CIC Agreement (i.e., will be paid on the first anniversary of the\nClosing, or, the earlier of the regular vesting date applicable to such award and the date the named executive\nofficer\u2019s employment is terminated either by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or a resignation by the named\nexecutive officer due to a \u201cconstructive termination\u201d  (in each case, as defined in the CIC Agreements)) and\nas provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nFor an estimate of the amount payable to each of the Company\u2019s named executive officers in respect of such\nunvested equity-based awards on the closing date of the Merger, assuming the closing date of the Merger\nwas September 7, 2021 for these purposes, see \u201c- Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the\nCompany in the Merger\u202f-\u202fGolden Parachute Compensation\u201d below.\nThe table below also sets forth the total number of Shares and number of Shares subject to equity-based\nawards determined as described above and below, per individual, expected to be held on the closing date of\nthe Merger, assuming (i) the closing date of the Merger was September 7, 2021 and (ii) the number of\noutstanding Shares and equity-based awards for each director and executive officer on the closing of the\nMerger were equal to the number of Shares and equity-based awards that were outstanding as of September\n7, 2021, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement (such\nnumbers do not forecast any grants, any vesting, additional issuances, dividends, additional deferrals or\nforfeitures of equity-based awards following the date of this proxy statement). For purposes of these\nestimates, the number of Shares owned and Shares subject to Company RSUs and Company PSUs were\nmultiplied by the per Share Merger Consideration of $87.50, and the number of Shares subject to Company\nSARs were multiplied by the difference between the per Share Merger Consideration of\u202f$87.50 and the\napplicable per Share base price.\nShares and Equity Awards held by Directors and Executive Officers\nName of Director and/or Executive\nOfficer\nClass A\nClass B\nShares \nOwned\nCompany \nSARs/\u200b\nOutstanding\nCompany \nRSUs \nOutstanding\nCompany \nPSUs \nOutstanding\nShares \nOwned\nCompany \nRSUs \nOutstanding\nTotal \nPayments\nScott J.

Ms. Kara L. Bellamy does not have a CIC Agreement and was not\npreviously approved to be included in the Company\u2019s Change in Control Policy\u037e however, following\nnegotiations among the Parent Entities, the Company and the Special Committee, and pursuant to the terms\nof the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee approved and the Parent has agreed to cause the Surviving\nCorporation to provide to all employees with a title of Vice President or above who also do not have a CIC\nAgreement and were not previously approved to be included in the Company\u2019s Change in Control Policy\n(including Ms. Bellamy) with change in control severance payments and benefits after a qualifying\ninvoluntary termination of employment, as described below, consistent with the terms of the Company\u2019s\nChange in Control Policy.\nThe terms of the CIC Agreements are substantially the same, each providing cash severance, accelerated\nvesting of certain previously granted, unvested, equity-based compensation and cash payments in lieu of\ncontinuation of benefits coverage. The CIC Agreements provide a gross-up for any excise taxes that the\nexecutive officers may incur under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n\u201cCode\u201d) if the amounts they receive would constitute \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d  (within the meaning of\nSection 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder).\nThe CIC Agreement for each of Mr. Chilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender provides that 50% of the previously\ngranted, unvested, equity-based compensation for the named executive vests immediately upon a change in\ncontrol. Subject to the accelerated vesting benefit described below, the remaining unvested equity awards\nwill vest upon the earlier of (i) the original vesting date or (ii) the first anniversary date of the change in\ncontrol, provided the named executive remains employed by the Company as of the relevant vesting date. All\nof the other change in control benefits provided under the CIC Agreements are considered \u201cdouble trigger,\u201d\nmeaning that the payment of cash severance, accelerated vesting of the remaining 50% of the previously\ngranted, unvested, equity-based compensation prior to the first anniversary date of the change in control\nand cash in lieu of continuation of benefits require both a \u201cchange in control\u201d of the Company and the\ntermination of the named executive\u2019s employment by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or a resignation by the\nnamed executive officer due to a \u201cconstructive termination\u201d  (in each case, as defined in the CIC Agreements)\nwithin eighteen (18) months following a change in control. The Merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d\nas defined in the CIC Agreements. Upon occurrence of such termination of employment, each of the CIC\nAgreements provides for the following:\na lump sum payment equal to eighteen (18) months times the base monthly salary of the named\nexecutive at the greater of: (a) the rate in effect at the time of the change in control or (b) the rate in\neffect at the time of termination of employment\u037e\na lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times the greater of: (a) the average annual bonus paid in the two (2)\nfiscal years prior to termination of employment or (b) the target bonus for the year of such termination\nof employment\u037e\n61 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nimmediate vesting of any unvested equity compensation\u037e and\na cash payment equivalent to the present value of the projected cost of continuation of all employee\nbenefits and perquisites, including life insurance, health benefits, disability insurance, cars and\nexpense reimbursement, and 401(k) matching payments for a period of eighteen (18) months following\ntermination, plus an amount equal to the portion of the named executive\u2019s unvested 401(k) account\nbalance that would vest if the named executive had eighteen (18) additional months of service for\nvesting purposes under our 401(k) plan.\nAs a condition to the receipt of the payments and benefits under the CIC Agreements, each of Mr. Chilton,\nMs. Lopker and Mr. Lender are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants for the one (1) year\nperiod following their termination of employment, which include a non-compete, a non-solicit of employees,\nnon-interference with the Company\u2019s relationship with its employees or customers, and non-disparagement\nof the Company.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Company\u2019s Change in Control Policy, Ms. Bellamy would\nbe entitled to receive the payments and benefits outlined below if her employment is terminated by the\nCompany without \u201ccause\u201d or she resigns following a \u201cchange in status\u201d  (in each case, as defined in the\nChange in Control Policy) during the twelve (12) months following a change in control. The Merger will\nconstitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d as defined in the Change in Control Policy. Upon occurrence of such\ntermination of employment, Ms. Bellamy will receive:\na payment equal to twelve (12) months of her base compensation. Under the Change in Control\nPolicy, compensation base is defined as an executive\u2019s highest fiscal year base salary in effect within\ntwo (2) years prior to the change in control\u037e\na payment equal to one times her average annual bonus. Under the Change in Control Policy, average\nannual bonus is defined as an executive\u2019s average annual bonus for the two (2) full fiscal years\nimmediately preceding the change in control\u037e\naccelerated vesting of any outstanding equity compensation awards granted under the Company\u2019s\nequity incentive plans\u037e and\na payment equal to twelve (12) months benefits replacement. The benefits replacement payment is\nintended to compensate the executive for employee benefits being received at the time of the\nexecutive\u2019s termination of employment.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under\nthe CIC Agreements and the Change in Control Policy to the named executive officers, see \u201c- Golden\nParachute Compensation\u201d below.\nIndemnification Benefits\nEach of the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors are entitled to the indemnification benefits in favor of\nthe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers, as described in more detail in \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202f\nIndemnification\u037e Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Insurance.\u201d\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nThe table below, titled \u201cPotential Change-in-Control Payments to Named Executive Officers,\u201d along with its\nfootnotes, sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation\npayable to the Company\u2019s named executive officers as determined for purposes of our most recent annual\nproxy statement, which compensation is subject to the non-binding, advisory, affirmative vote of a majority\nof the Shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon,\nas described below in \u201cMerger Related Executive Compensation Arrangements (The Golden Parachute\nProposal\u202f-\u202fProposal 2).\u201d Our named executive officers for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, included\nAnton Chilton, Chief Executive Officer, Pamela M.

Accordingly, the value of the tax gross-up payment may increase or\ndecrease based on changes to any of the above assumptions, calculations or other variables. The tax\ngross-up payment is \u201csingle trigger\u201d in nature as a termination of employment is not required in order to\nreceive such benefit.\nThe amounts in this column represent the total of all compensation in columns (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).\nAs a condition to the receipt of the payments and benefits under the CIC Agreements, each of Mr.\nChilton, Ms. Lopker and Mr. Lender are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants for the one\n(1) year period following their termination of employment, which include a non-compete, a non-solicit of\nemployees, non-interference with the Company\u2019s relationship with its employees or customers, and non-\ndisparagement of the Company.\nContribution and Exchange Agreement\nIn addition, as is described elsewhere in this proxy statement, on June 27, 2021, the Lopker Entities\nseparately entered into a Contribution and Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which and immediately prior to\nthe Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute to Ultimate Parent the Rollover Shares and, in exchange\nfor such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent will issue to the Lopker Entities the Parent Units.

QAD Inc., et al., a purported stockholder class action filed in Delaware Chancery Court on\nJuly 2, 2021, the plaintiff alleges breaches of contract and fiduciary duty against directors Anton Chilton,\nScott Adelson, Kathleen Crusco, and Peter van Cuylenburg (the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d), and Pamela M.\nLopker, as well as a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty against Thoma Bravo and certain\naffiliates of Thoma Bravo relating to the QAD Board\u2019s vote to approve the Merger Agreement. The complaint\nnames the Company as a defendant to the extent necessary for any of the relief requested. Plaintiff is\nseeking, among other things, to enjoin the Closing of the Merger or, in the alternative, damages, including\nrescissory damages. The plaintiff claims that the Contribution and Exchange Agreement (pursuant to which\nand immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Lopker Entities will contribute to Ultimate Parent the Rollover\nShares and, in exchange for such Rollover Shares, Ultimate Parent will issue to the Lopker Entities the Parent\nUnits) and the Merger Agreement violate Article IV, Section 2.B(d) of QAD\u2019s corporate charter, which\nprovides that holders of Class A Common Stock receive per Share consideration no less favorable than that\nreceived by any holders of Class B Common Stock in any merger. The plaintiff alleges that Ms. Lopker and\nthe Director Defendants breached Article IV, Section 2.B(d) of QAD\u2019s corporate charter, that Ms. Lopker\u2019s\nparticipation in the separate Contribution and Exchange Agreement with Thoma Bravo breached her fiduciary\nduties to the Company, that the Director Defendants\u2019 approval of the Merger breached their fiduciary duties\nto the Company, and that Thoma Bravo and its affiliates aided and abetted those breaches.

The descriptions in this\nsection and elsewhere in this proxy statement are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, reference to\nthe Merger Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the\ninformation about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the\nMerger Agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the Merger because it is the\nprincipal document governing the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information\nregarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and are not intended to provide you with any factual\ninformation about us or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about us contained in this proxy\nstatement or in our public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the Merger Agreement and this summary\nare not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts\nand circumstances relating to the Company. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement\nand in the public filings we make with the SEC, as described in the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of each of the parties to\nthe Merger Agreement that were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified\ndates. Those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the\nMerger Agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with the negotiation of\nthe Merger Agreement (including by being qualified by confidential disclosure schedules and certain other\ndisclosures exchanged between the parties to the Merger Agreement, which are not reflected in the Merger\nAgreement) and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality which may differ from what may be\nviewed as material by you or other investors. In particular, in your review of the representations and\nwarranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind\nthat the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the transactions\ncontemplated thereby if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a\nchange in circumstances or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement,\nrather than establishing matters as facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent\ninformation may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the Company. As of the date of this\nproxy statement, except as set forth in the Company\u2019s public disclosures, there are no specific material facts\nthat exist that the Company believes materially contradicts its representations and warranties in the Merger\nAgreement. The Company will provide additional disclosure in its public reports to the extent it becomes\naware of the existence of any specific material facts that are required to be disclosed under U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and might contradict its representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement.\nIn any event, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not\nbe read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy\nstatement and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. See the section titled \u201cWhere You Can\nFind More Information.\u201d\nCapitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this proxy statement have the meanings set forth\nin the Merger Agreement.

If, as of the Record Date,\nyou are the beneficial owner of Shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker, bank or other nominee, please\nrefer to the information forwarded by your broker, bank or other nominee for procedures on revoking your\nproxy.\nOnly your last submitted proxy will be considered. Please cast your vote \u201cFOR\u201d each of the proposals,\nfollowing the instructions in your proxy card or voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or\nother nominee, as promptly as possible.\nAdjournments and Postponements\nAny adjournment of the Special Meeting may be made from time to time by the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the Shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon,\nwhether or not a quorum is present, without further notice other than by an announcement made at the\nSpecial Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Special\nMeeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger\nAgreement Proposal, then our stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to approve one or more\nproposals to adjourn the Special Meeting, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal (as further\ndescribed in \u201cAdjournment of the Special Meeting (The Adjournment Proposal - Proposal 3) - The\nProposal\u201d). Any adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies with\nrespect to any such proposal will allow our stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke\nthem at any time with respect to such proposal prior to their use at the reconvened Special Meeting.\nThe holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class. Each\nrecord holder of Class A Common Stock is entitled to 1/20  of one vote for each share of Class A Common\nStock owned of record on the Record Date and each record holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to\none (1) vote for each share of Class B Common Stock owned of record on the Record Date.\nAnticipated Date of Completion of the Merger\nWe are working to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable. Assuming timely satisfaction of\nnecessary closing conditions, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the fourth (4 ) quarter of\n2021. If our stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Merger will become effective\nas promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the Merger as set\nforth in the Merger Agreement, and in any event, at the Effective Time.\nAppraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time who\ndo not vote such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand\nappraisal of such Shares and who do not effectively withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights of\nappraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of\nthe DGCL (\u201cSection 262\u201d). The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to\nappraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex E and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its\nentirety. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a\nrecommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in Section\n262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of Shares unless otherwise expressly\nnoted herein. Only a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal of such Shares registered in\nthat holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in Shares held of record in the name of another\nperson, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the\nsteps set forth in Section 262 (and summarized below) properly and in a timely manner to\n109 \nth\nth\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nperfect appraisal rights. If you hold your Shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to\nexercise appraisal rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of Shares who: (i) submit a written demand for\nappraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) do not\nsubmit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which such holders seek appraisal in favor\nof the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the\ndate of the making of the demand through the Effective Time\u037e and (iv) strictly comply with all other\nprocedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have such\nShares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nsuch Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,\ntogether with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the\ncourt. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss\nappraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number\nof Shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding Shares\nas measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate per Share\nMerger Consideration in respect of the Shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected\nexceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal\naward will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at\n5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nsuch period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal\nproceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an\namount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the\ntime of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of the Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest\naccrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,\nthe corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders\nwho was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights\nare available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy\nstatement constitutes the Company\u2019s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection\nwith the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E, in compliance\nwith the requirements of Section 262. In connection with the Merger, any holder of Shares who wishes to\nexercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex E\ncarefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may\nresult in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her, its or their appraisal\nrights will be entitled to receive the per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement,\nwithout interest thereon. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to\nseek appraisal of any Shares, the Company believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights,\nthat stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. To the extent there are any inconsistencies\nbetween the summary of Section 262 contained herein and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their Shares must do ALL of the following:\nNOT vote the Shares for which appraisal is sought in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement\u037e\ndeliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of such Shares before the vote on the Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting, which written demand must reasonably inform the Company of the\nidentity of the stockholder who intends to demand appraisal of his, her, its or their Shares and that\nsuch stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such Shares\u037e\ncontinuously hold such Shares on and from the date of making the demand through the Effective\nTime (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the Shares before the\nEffective Time)\u037e and\n110 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfile a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of such\nShares within 120 days after the Effective Time. This may be undertaken by the stockholder (or any\nperson who is the beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a broker, bank or other\nnominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation is under\nno obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nadoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of Shares wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement will be submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s Shares,\nand that stockholder must not vote such Shares or submit a proxy for such Shares in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement. A holder of Shares exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the Shares on the\ndate the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the Shares of record through the\nEffective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be\nvoted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder\u2019s\nright of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a\nstockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights for such stockholder\u2019s Shares\nmust submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or\nabstain from voting, with respect to such Shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will,\nin and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The\nwritten demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote against the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute\na demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the Shares registered in that\nholder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of Shares must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of\nrecord, and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the holder and state that the person\nintends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s Shares in connection with the Merger. If the Shares are\nowned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such\ndemand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the Shares are owned of record by more\nthan one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on\nbehalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint\nowners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify\nthe record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as\nagent for the record owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker, bank or other nominee who holds\nShares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Shares held\nfor one or more beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand should set forth the number of Shares as\nto which appraisal is sought, and where no number of Shares is expressly mentioned it will be presumed to\ncover all Shares held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds Shares through a broker who in\nturn holds the Shares through a central securities depositary nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for\nappraisal of such Shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the\ndepository nominee as the record holder.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES THROUGH A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE AND\nWHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKER, BANK OR\nOTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE\nBROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A\n111 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN\nSHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR\nOTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY\nAND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to the Company at\n100 Innovation Place, Santa Barbara, CA 93108, and may not be submitted by electronic submission. Such\nwritten demand must be delivered to and received by the Company before the vote on the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement at the Special Meeting.\nAny holder of Shares who has delivered a written demand to the Company and who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her, its or their demand\nfor appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to the\nCompany a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the\ndemand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any\nstockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned\nupon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect\nthe right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the per Share Merger\nConsideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, within sixty (60) days after\nthe Effective Time. If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and the Company, as the Surviving Corporation,\ndoes not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except\nwith respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso\nin the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of\nan appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the\nappraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or\nmore than the per Share Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify\neach holder of Shares who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and\nwho has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective\nand the effective date thereof.\nand the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of\nShares who has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262\n(including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant Shares) may commence an appraisal\nproceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving\nCorporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination\nof the fair value of the Shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should\nnot assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\nfair value of the Shares. Accordingly, any holders of Shares who desire to have their Shares appraised\nshould initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their Shares within the time\nand in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Shares to file such a petition within the\nperiod specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements of\nSection 262 and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written\nrequest, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of Shares\nnot voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which the Company has\nreceived demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such Shares. The Surviving\n112 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCorporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt by the\nSurviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration\nof the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of Shares held\neither in a voting trust or by a broker, bank or other nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s\nown name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing\nstatements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of Shares and a copy thereof is served upon the\nSurviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such\nservice to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses\nof all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to the value\nof their Shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving\nCorporation and all of the stockholders shown on the written statement described above at the addresses\nstated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a\nnewspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication\ndetermined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to\nstockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing\non the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become\nentitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who\ndemanded payment for their Shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for\nnotation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any stockholder fails to comply with\nthe direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The\nDelaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have asserted\nappraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Shares entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership\nthresholds described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal\nproceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any\nrules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount\ndetermined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into\naccount all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly\nand will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However,\nat any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the\nSurviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case\nsuch interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at\nsuch time.\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving\nthe value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,\nthe court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on\nfuture prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion\n113 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n[that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative\nelements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of\nDelaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known\nor susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nIn addition, the Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual\ncircumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as so\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the\nconsideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their Shares and\nthat an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in\na determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per Share Merger Consideration. Neither\nCompany nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per Share Merger Consideration to any stockholder\nexercising appraisal rights, and each of Company and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash\npayment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for\npurposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a Share is less than the per Share Merger Consideration. If a\npetition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds described above has been\nsatisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of\nthe appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with\nan appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses\nof experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the Shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of\nsuch determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her, its or their Shares under Section 262 fails to perfect, or\neffectively loses or withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s Shares will be deemed to\nhave been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the per Share Merger Consideration,\nwithout interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with the terms\nand conditions of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw,\nthe holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if\nneither of the ownership thresholds described above has been satisfied as to stockholders seeking appraisal\nrights or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation an effective written withdrawal of the\nholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with\nSection 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote\nsuch Shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s Shares, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to\nthe Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the ownership thresholds described\nabove has been satisfied as to the stockholders seeking appraisal rights, or if the stockholder delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger,\neither within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is\nfiled with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to\nany stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms\nas the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw\nsuch stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60)\ndays after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a\nstockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights\nis encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n114 \n",

For\npurposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent\ncorporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date\nthe notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger\nor consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the\nnotice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day\nnext preceding the day on which the notice is given.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof\nand who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a\npetition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such\nstockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined\nthat proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements\nof subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic\ntransmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that\npurpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger\nor resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted\nin favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7251(h) of this\ntitle, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7251(h)(6)d. of this\ntitle)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in,\nthe offer referred to in \u00a7251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have\nbeen received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the\nstockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a statement is received by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of\ndemands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding\nsubsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either\nin a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a\npetition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the\nsurviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements\nas to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the\npetition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by\nsuch a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the\ntime and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or\nresulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such\nnotice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a\nnewspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as\nthe Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by\nthe Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this\nsection and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who\nhave demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit\ntheir certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the\nappraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss\nthe proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of\nthe class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were\nlisted on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of\nsuch shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares\nE-3 \n(h) \n(i) \n(j) \n(k) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nentitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)\nthe value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares\nexceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to \u00a7253 or \u00a7267 of this title.\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be\nconducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically\ngoverning appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of\nthe shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nmerger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the\nfair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless\nthe Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this\nsubsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment\nshall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including\nany surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the\nmerger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in\ncash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nCourt, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving\nor resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the\nCourt may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\nstockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted\nsuch stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate\nfully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal\nrights under this section.\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to\neach such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders\nof shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates\nrepresenting such stock. The Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery\nmay be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of\nany state.\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court\ndeems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a\nportion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,\nincluding, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be\ncharged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any\npurpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or\nother distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the\ntime provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or\nresulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the\ncorporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder\nwithout the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court\ndeems just\u037e provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has\nnot commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation\nwithin 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of\nthis section.\nE-4 \n(l) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders\nwould have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of\nauthorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nE-5 \n",
