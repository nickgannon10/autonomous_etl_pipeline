        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger\nagreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to\nyou. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement,\nincluding the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in this proxy statement. You\nmay obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the\ninstructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nOn October 10, 2022, we announced that ForgeRock entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger\nagreement, Parent will acquire ForgeRock for $23.25 in cash per share of our common stock. In order to complete\nthe merger, our stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of\nour common stock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This\napproval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement-Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.\u201d The ForgeRock Board is furnishing this\nproxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of our common stock in connection with the\nsolicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the special meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the\nmerger agreement, the special meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed\nmaterials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock without attending the special\nmeeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy\nas soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on ForgeRock?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of ForgeRock by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is\napproved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or\nwaived, Merger Sub will merge with and into ForgeRock, with ForgeRock continuing as the surviving\ncorporation. As a result of the merger, ForgeRock will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our\nClass A common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our\nClass A common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports\nwith the SEC.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $23.25 in cash (subject to certain exceptions),\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own,\nunless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our\ncommon stock, you will receive $2,325 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest\nand less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nHow does the per share price compare to the market price of ForgeRock\u2019s Class A common stock?\nA:\nThis amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 53% over ForgeRock\u2019s closing share price on October\n10, 2022, the last full trading day prior to the transaction announcement, and (2) a premium of approximately 44%\nover the volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock for the 30-day period ending October 10,\n2022.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to ForgeRock RSUs and ForgeRock options?\nA:\nGenerally speaking, ForgeRock RSUs and ForgeRock options will be treated as follows:\n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the merger each vested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the\nright to receive an amount in cash equal in value to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common\nstock or Class B common stock subject to such vested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective\ntime or the merger, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding taxes.\n15TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the merger, each unvested ForgeRock RSU will be cancelled and converted into the\ncontingent right to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1)\nthe total number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such\nunvested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the per\nshare price, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each\nConverted Cash Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions\n(including acceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the\ncorresponding unvested ForgeRock RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, provided that\nterms rendered inoperable by the transactions contemplated by the transaction documents entered into\nconnection with the merger will no longer have any force or effect.\n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the merger, each vested ForgeRock option will be cancelled and converted into the\nright to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) the total number of shares of our Class A common stock or\nClass B common stock subject to the vested ForgeRock option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the\nper share price over the per share exercise price of such vested ForgeRock option, less applicable\nwithholding taxes.\n\u2022\nAt the effective time of the merger each unvested ForgeRock option will be converted into the contingent\nright to receive from Parent or the surviving corporation a Converted Cash Award equal to (1) the total\nnumber of shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock subject to such unvested\nForgeRock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any,\nof the per share price over the per share exercise price per of such unvested ForgeRock option, less\napplicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such Converted\nCash Award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions (including\nacceleration provisions upon a qualifying termination of employment (if any)) as applied to the\ncorresponding unvested ForgeRock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.\n\u2022\nAny underwater ForgeRock option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration\nor payment.\nQ:\nWhat will happen to the ESPP?\nA:\nFrom the date of the merger agreement, we will take all actions necessary to (1) provide that no new individuals\nwill be permitted to enroll in the ESPP\u037e (2) make any adjustment that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the\nshortened offering period or purchase period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase\nperiod as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the\nESPP\u037e (3) not allow any increase in the amount of participants\u2019 payroll deduction elections under the ESPP\nduring the offering period or purchase period that is in effect on date of the merger agreement\u037e (4) cause the\nexercise (as of no later than one business day prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each\noutstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP (but otherwise no other of our Class A common stock under\nthe ESPP will be issued)\u037e (5) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence pursuant\nto the ESPP, and if the effective time of the merger would otherwise occur before the end of the Current Purchase\nPeriod, shorten the Current Purchase Period as of a specified trading day at least ten days prior to the date on\nwhich the effective time of the merger occurs\u037e and (6) not extend the Current Purchase Period. Immediately prior\nto and effective as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), we will\nterminate the ESPP and no further rights will be granted or exercised under the ESPP after such termination.\nQ:\nWhat am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?\nA:\nYou are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\nto adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into ForgeRock and\nForgeRock will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent\u037e\n\u2022\nto approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by\nForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nto approve the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or\nappropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the\ntime of the special meeting.\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will take place on January 12, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time.

This is an advisory vote and will\nnot be binding on ForgeRock or Parent. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for such\ncompensation are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval.\nAccordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is consummated, the\ncompensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive officers in connection with\nthe merger will or may be paid to ForgeRock\u2019s named executive officers even if our stockholders do not approve\nsuch compensation.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d If you are a\nstockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf\nof ForgeRock.

If you attend the special meeting and vote at the special meeting, your\nvote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.\nIf, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you may not vote your\nshares at the special meeting unless you provide a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee giving\nyou the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. Otherwise, you should instruct your bank, broker or\nother nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form provided by your bank,\nbroker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be\nconsidered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be\ncounted for purposes of a quorum or voted at the meeting, which will have the same effect as voting against the\nadoption of the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhy did ForgeRock choose to hold a virtual special meeting?\nA:\nThe ForgeRock Board decided to hold the special meeting virtually in order to facilitate stockholder attendance\nand participation by enabling stockholders to participate fully, and equally, from virtually any location around\nthe world, at no cost. However, you will bear any costs associated with your internet access, such as usage\ncharges from internet access providers and telephone companies. We believe this is the right choice for a\ncompany with a global footprint. A virtual special meeting makes it possible for more stockholders (regardless of\nsize, resources or physical location) to have direct access to information, while saving us and our stockholders\ntime and money. We also believe that the online tools that we have selected will increase stockholder\ncommunication. We remain very sensitive to concerns that virtual meetings may diminish stockholder voice or\nreduce accountability. Accordingly, we have designed our virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain,\nstockholder access, participation and communication.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of our common\nstock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is\ncalled a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is\ncalled a \u201cproxy card.\u201d You may follow the instructions on the proxy card to designate a proxy by telephone or by\nthe Internet in the same manner as if you had signed, dated and returned a proxy card. Francis Rosch, John\nFernandez and Samuel Fleischmann, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy\nholders for the special meeting.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is\nvoted at the special meeting by:\n\u2022\nsigning another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting\u037e\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier\nsubmitted proxy\u037e\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary\u037e or\n\u2022\nattending the special meeting and voting at the special meeting using the control number on the enclosed\nproxy card.\nIf you hold your shares of our common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other\nnominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the special meeting if you\nobtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the\nspecial meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to grant your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will\nvote your shares in the way that you direct.\nIf you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a\nmatter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the ForgeRock\nBoard with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to our named executive\nofficers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time,\nto a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to\nadopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. After the merger is completed, any holders of physical stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal\ncontaining instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the\nappropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented by your stock certificates. Unless\nyou are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the\ncash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. If you\nhold your shares of our common stock in book-entry form, you will not receive a letter of transmittal. Instead, the\npayment agent will pay you the appropriate portion of the merger consideration upon receipt of a customary\n\u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d and any other items specified by the payment agent.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special\nmeeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective\ndate of the merger. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the\nspecial meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the\nperson to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies ForgeRock in writing of such special\narrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share price with respect to such shares, if the merger\nis completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those\nshares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record\ndate, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card (a prepaid reply envelope is provided\nfor your convenience) or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions found on the proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone for) each proxy\ncard and voting instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and\nmultiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than\none account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a\nseparate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder\nof record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.\nPlease vote all voting materials that you receive.\n21\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nIf available, ForgeRock may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting.\nForgeRock intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC\nfollowing the special meeting. All reports that ForgeRock files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For\nmore information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the\nmerger?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or\nloss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of\ncash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our\ncommon stock surrendered in the merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our\ncommon stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States,\nbut may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification\nprocedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances\nand any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S.\ntaxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not constitute legal advice\nto any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is\nprovided in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the merger in the first half of 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of\nthe merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the\nmerger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to\nthe merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, and no agreement with any governmental\nauthority not to consummate the merger shall be in effect. In addition, the merger cannot be completed until all\nconsents, approvals and filings required under certain specified FDI laws have been obtained or made and all\nwaiting periods (including any extensions thereof) (including any timing agreements with applicable\ngovernmental authorities) relating to the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the\nconsummation of the merger shall have expired or otherwise been terminated under any such laws.\nForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with\nthe FTC and the DOJ on October 24, 2022. Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified the FTC\nand the DOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12\nof the HSR Act in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent\u2019s notification and\nreport form was withdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form\non November 28, 2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting period commenced under the HSR Act. Both before\nand after the expiration of the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge\nthe merger on antitrust grounds.\nIn addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock, submitted the specified FDI filings on\nOctober 31, 2022.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the merger is consummated, our stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of capital stock) who (1)\ndo not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) continuously hold their shares of our\n22\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncommon stock through the effective time of the merger\u037e (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares\u037e (4) meet\ncertain other conditions and statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement\u037e and (5) do not\nwithdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their\nshares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section\n262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that these persons will be entitled to have their shares appraised by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares, exclusive of\nany elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the\nDelaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the\namount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective date of the merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the\nmerger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before the\nentry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person\nseeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y)\ninterest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make\nsuch voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons who wish to seek appraisal of their\nshares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to\nthe complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in\nadditional detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL\nregarding appraisal rights, available at the following URL, accessible without subscription or cost, which is\nincorporated herein by reference: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\nQ:\nDo any of ForgeRock\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of\nForgeRock stockholders generally? \nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the ForgeRock Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the\nmerger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the\nmerger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. In: (1) evaluating and\nnegotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and (3) unanimously\nrecommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the ForgeRock Board was aware of\nand considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more\ninformation, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Interests of ForgeRock\u2019s Directors\nand Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWho can help answer my questions?\nA:\nIf you have any questions concerning the merger, the special meeting or this proxy statement, would like\nadditional copies of the accompanying proxy statement or need help submitting your proxy or voting your\nshares of our common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:\n\u202f\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\n(212) 929-5500 (Call Collect)\nor\nCall Toll-Free (800) 322-2885\nEmail: proxy@mackenziepartners.com\n23\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.\nThe effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that\ncertificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may\nagree and specify in such certificate of merger).\nEffect on ForgeRock if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,\nour stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger.\nInstead, (1) ForgeRock will remain an independent public company\u037e (2) our Class A common stock will continue to be\nlisted and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act\u037e and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports\nwith the SEC.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe ForgeRock Board, together with senior management, regularly evaluates ForgeRock\u2019s strategic direction and\nongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening ForgeRock\u2019s business and enhancing stockholder value.\nAs part of this evaluation, the ForgeRock Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives.\nThese have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, ForgeRock\u2019s current\nbusiness plan, with ForgeRock remaining an independent entity\u037e (2) potential expansion opportunities through\nacquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships\u037e (3) various capital raising alternatives\u037e and (4) other\nfinancial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of ForgeRock.\nIn June 2021, after ForgeRock confidentially submitted a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with its\ninitial public offering and before ForgeRock became a publicly listed company, at the direction of the ForgeRock\nBoard, representatives of J.P. Morgan and ForgeRock\u2019s other lead book-running manager in the initial public offering\ncontacted seven potential strategic acquirors, including Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C and Strategic D, and two\nfinancial sponsors, including Thoma Bravo, regarding a potential acquisition of ForgeRock. Of the contacted parties,\nThoma Bravo expressed interest in pursuing a potential transaction with ForgeRock. ForgeRock entered into a\nconfidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo containing a customary \u201cstandstill\u201d restriction that would terminate\nupon entry into a definitive agreement for an acquisition of ForgeRock. Thereafter, representatives of Thoma Bravo\nconducted due diligence with respect to ForgeRock\u2019s business. Thoma Bravo submitted two proposals to acquire\nForgeRock before ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering. At that time, the ForgeRock Board determined that ForgeRock\ncould achieve a more attractive valuation for our stockholders in an initial public offering. ForgeRock terminated\nthose discussions with Thoma Bravo regarding a potential acquisition in August 2021.\nFollowing its initial public offering, ForgeRock from time to time received inbound inquiries expressing a non-specific\ninterest in pursuing a potential transaction from a potential strategic acquiror (which is referred to as \u201cStrategic E\u201d)\nand three financial sponsors (which are referred to as \u201cSponsor A,\u201d \u201cSponsor B\u201d and \u201cSponsor C\u201d). Fran Rosch,\nForgeRock\u2019s chief executive officer, met with these parties from time to time to discuss ForgeRock\u2019s business and the\nindustry in which it operates\u037e other than as described below, these discussions did not advance beyond preliminary,\nhypothetical conversations regarding a potential transaction or result in the receipt by ForgeRock of an acquisition\nproposal. Mr. Rosch regularly updated Bruce Golden, as chairperson of the ForgeRock Board, on inquiries and\npreliminary discussions with respect to potential strategic transactions involving ForgeRock.\nOn January 31, 2022, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo to\ngenerally discuss updates on ForgeRock\u2019s business. At the meeting, the parties did not discuss a potential\nacquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn April 25, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo, at Mr. Rosch\u2019s invitation, to generally\ndiscuss the potential benefits of a technology partnership between ForgeRock and another company. Entities\naffiliated with Thoma Bravo had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire that other company on April 10, 2022.\nAt the meeting, the parties did not discuss a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn May 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with a senior executive of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request. During this\nmeeting, Thoma Bravo expressed a non-specific interest in an acquisition of ForgeRock but did not make a formal\nacquisition proposal. Mr. Rosch informed Thoma Bravo that ForgeRock would be open to discussing a potential\nacquisition. Thereafter, on or about May 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch updated Mr. Golden on the meeting with Thoma Bravo.\n34TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 25, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with a senior representative of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request. Thoma\nBravo informed Mr. Rosch that it would be submitting an offer to acquire ForgeRock at a purchase price of $23.00 per\nshare.\nLater on May 25, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo sent to ForgeRock a non-binding indication of interest\naddressed to the ForgeRock Board to acquire all of ForgeRock\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock for $23.00 per\nshare (which is referred to as the \u201cMay proposal\u201d), representing a 32% premium to ForgeRock\u2019s closing share price as\nof May 25, 2022. The May proposal also contemplated a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision that would permit ForgeRock to solicit\nalternative bids for 30 days after signing a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma\nBravo. On May 26, 2022 Mr. Rosch informed Mr. Golden of ForgeRock\u2019s receipt of the May proposal.\nOn May 27, 2022, Mr. Rosch informed the ForgeRock Board that Thoma Bravo had submitted the May proposal.\nOn June 1, 2022, the ForgeRock Board held a meeting, with members of ForgeRock\u2019s management, representatives of\nWilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. (which we refer to as \u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), ForgeRock\u2019s outside legal advisor,\nand, at the invitation of the ForgeRock Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan in attendance. As part of an ordinary\ncourse market update, the representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed with the ForgeRock Board the current market\nenvironment and ForgeRock\u2019s trading and financial performance since its initial public offering. The representatives\nof J.P. Morgan then left the meeting. Mr. Rosch reviewed the May proposal with the ForgeRock Board. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties. It was proposed to establish a\nstrategic committee of the ForgeRock Board to work with ForgeRock\u2019s legal counsel and other advisors in connection\nwith ForgeRock\u2019s review of the May proposal, including its review of ForgeRock\u2019s standalone plan and the\nevaluation of other potential strategic alternatives. In considering the establishment of a strategic committee, the\nForgeRock Board discussed (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in the evaluation of the\nMay proposal and other strategic alternatives\u037e (2) the possibility that ForgeRock\u2019s management may need feedback\nand direction on relatively short notice in connection with a potential process of considering strategic alternatives\u037e\nand (3) the benefits and convenience of having a subset of directors oversee a potential process of considering\nstrategic alternatives. Following the discussion, the ForgeRock Board determined that it would form a strategic\ncommittee of the ForgeRock Board to evaluate the May proposal, including comparing the proposal to ForgeRock\u2019s\nstandalone plan and potential strategic alternatives.\nOn June 5, 2022, the ForgeRock Board, acting by unanimous written consent, established the strategic committee of\nthe ForgeRock Board (which we refer to as the \u201cStrategic Committee\u201d). The ForgeRock Board delegated authority to\nthe Strategic Committee to, among other things, (1) oversee and assist ForgeRock\u2019s management, advisors and\nconsultants with respect to the exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives, including to explore, evaluate and\nconsider potential counterparties to a strategic transaction involving ForgeRock\u037e (2) explore, evaluate, consider,\nreview and negotiate the terms and conditions of any transaction relating to any strategic alternative\u037e and (3) if\nappropriate, recommend to the ForgeRock Board what action, if any, should be taken by ForgeRock with respect to\nany strategic alternative. The ForgeRock Board retained the power and authority to approve the entry into a\ndefinitive agreement relating to any strategic alternative, including a sale of ForgeRock. The ForgeRock Board also\ndetermined that it would continue to have an active role in the consideration of strategic alternatives. The ForgeRock\nBoard appointed Mr. Golden, Jeff Parks and Dave Welsh, all of whom are independent members of the ForgeRock\nBoard, as the members of the Strategic Committee.\nOn June 6, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of ForgeRock\u2019s management and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee their\nfiduciary duties. The Strategic Committee discussed whether to engage a financial advisor in connection with the\nForgeRock Board\u2019s and Strategic Committee\u2019s review of the May proposal. The Strategic Committee requested that\nMr. Golden, with the assistance of ForgeRock management, meet with J.P. Morgan and report back to the Strategic\nCommittee.\nOn June 9, 2022, the Strategic Committee informed the ForgeRock Board of its selection of J.P. Morgan as\nForgeRock\u2019s financial advisor in connection with its evaluation of the May proposal. J.P. Morgan is well known to\nForgeRock given J.P. Morgan\u2019s service as a lead book running manager in ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering. The\nStrategic Committee selected J.P. Morgan to act as financial advisor to ForgeRock after considering J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nqualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of ForgeRock\u2019s business and the industry in\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwhich ForgeRock operates and experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential strategic\ntransactions. In addition, representatives from J.P. Morgan had from time-to-time presented to the ForgeRock Board\nand management about public market perspectives of ForgeRock.\nOn June 9, 2022, ForgeRock management distributed to the ForgeRock Board a draft of ForgeRock\u2019s then-current\nbusiness plan, which had been prepared as a basis for issuing ForgeRock\u2019s guidance for the second quarter of 2022\nand subsequently updated by management, including the unaudited prospective financial information for fiscal years\n2022 through 2024 (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 2022 business plan\u201d). Additional information about the\npreparation and substance of the June 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d Following the ForgeRock Board\u2019s review, management\nprovided the June 2022 business plan to representatives of J.P. Morgan for purposes of its preliminary financial\nanalysis of the May proposal.\nOn June 18, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. The\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The Strategic Committee discussed the May proposal and the\npotential landscape of other potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most likely to be interested in\npursuing a strategic transaction with ForgeRock. Mr. Rosch noted that Strategic E had previously expressed a non-\nspecific interest in acquiring ForgeRock, and had indicated in a prior discussion that it may submit a proposal in July\n2022. Strategic E never submitted such a proposal. The Strategic Committee authorized Mr. Rosch, on behalf of the\nForgeRock Board, to inform Thoma Bravo that the ForgeRock Board (1) was not interested in pursuing a transaction\nwith Thoma Bravo at $23.00 per share of ForgeRock at that time\u037e and (2) would be interested in taking the next step in\npursuing a transaction if the offer price per share were increased to an amount \u201ccloser to $30.00 than $25.00.\u201d\nOn June 19, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Rosch contacted a senior representative of Thoma Bravo\nand Mr. Rosch delivered the ForgeRock Board\u2019s message. Thoma Bravo responded that it would need to conduct\nadditional due diligence before submitting a revised proposal. Mr. Rosch informed the Strategic Committee of Thoma\nBravo\u2019s response, and the Strategic Committee authorized management to provide additional due diligence to Thoma\nBravo.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The\nStrategic Committee reviewed J.P. Morgan\u2019s relationship disclosure letter. Mr. Rosch also provided an update on\nForgeRock\u2019s anticipated results for the second quarter of 2022, including relative to ForgeRock\u2019s publicly issued\nguidance for this period (which we refer to as the \u201cQ2 2022 results\u201d). It was noted that ForgeRock would not meet\nits publicly issued guidance for annual recurring revenue for the second quarter of 2022.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the May proposal. The\nStrategic Committee discussed the Q2 2022 results. The representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The Strategic\nCommittee instructed management to update the June 2022 business plan in light of the Q2 2022 results and to\npresent the updated business plan to the ForgeRock Board. Representatives of management left the meeting. The\nStrategic Committee determined that it would instruct J.P. Morgan to contact Thoma Bravo to share the Q2 2022\nresults and gauge Thoma Bravo\u2019s reaction to the Q2 2022 results.\nOn July 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan spoke to a senior representative of Thoma Bravo regarding the Q2\n2022 results. Thoma Bravo informed J.P. Morgan that it remained interested in acquiring ForgeRock, and that Thoma\nBravo intended to submit a revised proposal following its next investment committee meeting in mid-July 2022.\nOn July 11, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an overview of Thoma Bravo\u2019s diligence over the preceding week, and\nmanagement\u2019s plan to update its June 2022 business plan based on actual results and business trends, including the\nQ2 2022 results. The Strategic Committee discussed a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a strategic\ntransaction from additional potential counterparties, including the possibility of soliciting alternative acquisition\nproposals in conjunction with Thoma Bravo\u2019s anticipated acquisition proposal and the possibility of executing such\na strategic transaction prior to ForgeRock's upcoming public announcement of its earnings results for the second\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nquarter of 2022. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed various strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most\nlikely to be interested in exploring a transaction with ForgeRock, based on such acquirors\u2019 perceived interest in\nmaking investments in the industry in which ForgeRock operates, whether they had previously expressed a credible\ninterest in acquiring ForgeRock and/or their financial capability to consummate a transaction of this size. The\nStrategic Committee discussed the risks in connection with an outreach, and in particular, the risk that the Q2 2022\nresults could be leaked. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Strategic Committee\ntheir fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that an outreach process to additional\npotential acquirors (1) was unlikely to yield a counterparty that could execute a transaction before ForgeRock\u2019s\nupcoming earnings announcement\u037e (2) would consume management\u2019s time as it was preparing for its upcoming\nearnings announcement\u037e and (3) posed a substantial risk of leaks. The Strategic Committee also considered that\nshould ForgeRock enter into a transaction with Thoma Bravo in conjunction with ForgeRock\u2019s upcoming earnings\nannouncement, it expected that ForgeRock would have the ability to conduct a broad outreach process during a go-\nshop period as previously proposed by Thoma Bravo. The Strategic Committee determined that it would wait until\nThoma Bravo submitted a revised offer, and at that time, the Strategic Committee would revisit whether to initiate an\noutreach to certain counterparties.\nOn July 12, 2022, Thoma Bravo was granted access to a virtual data room hosted by ForgeRock to share due\ndiligence information.\nOn July 13, 2022, ForgeRock amended and restated the confidentiality agreement with Thoma Bravo that had been\nentered into prior to ForgeRock\u2019s initial public offering. As amended, the confidentiality agreement, among other\nthings, extended the term of the confidentiality restrictions and the \u201cstandstill\u201d period under the existing\nconfidentiality agreement.\nLater on July 13, 2022, members of management gave a management presentation regarding ForgeRock to Thoma\nBravo.\nOn July 14, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in attendance.\nRepresentatives of management discussed management\u2019s then-updated business plan, including the unaudited\nprospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024 included in the business plan as of July 2022\n(which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 2022 business plan\u201d). Additional information about the preparation and substance of\nthe July 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective\nFinancial Information.\u201d The ForgeRock Board authorized sharing the July 2022 business plan with Thoma Bravo. The\nJuly 2022 business plan was provided to Thoma Bravo in due diligence, and also J.P. Morgan for purposes of its\nongoing financial analyses.\nOn July 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo orally informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that, following additional diligence,\nThoma Bravo maintained its initial proposed purchase price of $23.00 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly\nproposal\u201d). Representatives of Thoma Bravo noted to the representatives of J.P. Morgan that they viewed the July\nproposal as an improvement to the May proposal in light of the Q2 2022 results.\nOn July 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The representatives of J.P. Morgan shared with the Strategic Committee the July proposal, and\nreviewed with the Strategic Committee the current market and industry conditions and potential responses to the July\nproposal, including (1) attempting to negotiate for a higher purchase price\u037e (2) guiding Thoma Bravo to an increased\npurchase price range\u037e or (3) terminating the discussions with Thoma Bravo altogether. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan then left the meeting. Representatives of management reviewed the Q2 2022 results and potential execution\nrisks to achieving ForgeRock\u2019s July 2022 business plan, including current market and industry conditions and\nchallenges to attracting and retaining personnel.\nLater on July 20, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and management reviewed the discussions with Thoma Bravo\nto date, and the July proposal. The Strategic Committee reviewed with the ForgeRock Board potential responses to\nthe July proposal. The ForgeRock Board considered a potential outreach process to solicit interest in a strategic\ntransaction from additional potential counterparties at that time, including the risks in connection with such an\noutreach. Representatives of management reviewed the Q2 2022 results and potential execution risks to achieving\nForgeRock\u2019s July 2022 business plan, including current market and industry conditions and challenges to attracting\nand retaining personnel.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStill later on July 20, 2022, the Strategic Committee reconvened, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and\nWilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed ForgeRock\u2019s potential responses to the July\nproposal. The Strategic Committee discussed again whether to conduct a potential outreach process to solicit\ninterest from additional potential counterparties at that time. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with\nthe members of the Strategic Committee their fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that\nForgeRock should continue to discuss a potential transaction with Thoma Bravo, and the Strategic Committee\ninstructed J.P. Morgan to request that Thoma Bravo submit a revised acquisition proposal at an increased value. The\nStrategic Committee also determined not to conduct a broader outreach process to additional potential acquirors at\nthat time. Representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated the Strategic Committee\u2019s response to Thoma Bravo.\nOn July 26, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that Thoma Bravo had\ndetermined that it would not move forward with an acquisition of ForgeRock at that time. Among the reasons cited\nwere the uncertainty surrounding the market\u2019s reaction to ForgeRock\u2019s upcoming second quarter earnings\nannouncement and ForgeRock\u2019s then-current trading price.\nOn July 27, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed Thoma Bravo\u2019s decision to not move forward with an acquisition\nat that time. The Strategic Committee also discussed ForgeRock\u2019s upcoming earnings announcement and guidance\nfor the remainder of 2022. The Strategic Committee determined that it would suspend its review of strategic\nalternatives at that time.\nOn July 28, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch updated\nthe ForgeRock Board on the discussions with Thoma Bravo. The ForgeRock Board discussed Thoma Bravo\u2019s\ndecision not to move forward with an acquisition at that time. The ForgeRock Board determined that it would\nsuspend its review of strategic alternatives at that time. As a result, on that day, ForgeRock sent to Thoma Bravo a\nrequest to return or destroy ForgeRock confidential information in accordance with the confidentiality agreement\nwith Thoma Bravo.\nOn August 3, 2022, a senior representative of Thoma Bravo contacted Mr. Rosch to indicate interest in re-engaging in\ndiscussions with ForgeRock regarding a potential transaction at some point in the future. Later on August 3, 2022,\nMr. Rosch updated Mr. Golden on Thoma Bravo\u2019s outreach.\nOn August 11, 2022, ForgeRock announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nOn August 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. In light of the potential for Thoma Bravo to renew its interest in exploring an acquisition of ForgeRock,\nand based on the Strategic Committee\u2019s prior review of potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors most\nlikely to be interested in exploring a transaction with ForgeRock, the Strategic Committee determined it would be\nprudent to begin conversations with those additional parties that might consider an acquisition of ForgeRock. The\nStrategic Committee directed management to work with J.P. Morgan to contact four financial sponsors, including\nSponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C, and four strategic acquirors, Strategic A, Strategic B, Strategic C and Strategic\nD, to solicit interest in a potential acquisition of ForgeRock, and if such counterparties decided to engage, enter into\nconfidentiality agreements, hold initial management presentations and provide due diligence to such parties.\nLater on August 26, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Mr. Golden, on behalf of the Strategic Committee, informed the ForgeRock Board of the Strategic\nCommittee\u2019s determination to engage in a targeted outreach to certain potential counterparties. The ForgeRock Board\nagreed with the Strategic Committee\u2019s determination.\nBetween August 26, 2022 and August 28, 2022, representatives of the financial sponsors and potential strategic\nacquirors that the Strategic Committee had selected for outreach were contacted (at the request of the Strategic\nCommittee) by representatives of J.P. Morgan and/or Mr. Rosch. Of the parties contacted, Sponsor A, Sponsor B and\nSponsor C expressed an interest in pursuing discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with ForgeRock.\nThe remaining parties declined.\nOn August 31, 2022 and September 1, 2022, ForgeRock entered into confidentiality agreements with each of Sponsor\nA, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. The confidentiality agreements with each of those parties included a customary\n\u201cstandstill\u201d restriction that would terminate upon ForgeRock\u2019s entry into a definitive agreement for an acquisition of\nForgeRock.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 2, 2022, representatives of management gave management presentations regarding ForgeRock to each\nof Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Thereafter, and throughout the month of September, each of Sponsor A,\nSponsor B and Sponsor C engaged in due diligence and discussions with ForgeRock, which included multiple\nmeetings with members of ForgeRock management, members of the Strategic Committee and representatives of J.P.\nMorgan to discuss ForgeRock\u2019s business and a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn September 12, 2022, a representative of Sponsor D, on an unsolicited basis, contacted a ForgeRock director,\nexpressing a non-specific interest in meeting with representatives of management. Thereafter, the director connected\nrepresentatives of Sponsor D with Mr. Rosch, and Mr. Rosch had an introductory meeting with representatives of\nSponsor D on September 30, 2022.\nOn September 12, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with representatives of Thoma Bravo, at Thoma Bravo\u2019s request. The\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that Thoma Bravo desired to re-engage in discussions regarding\na potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn September 14, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The Strategic Committee updated the ForgeRock Board on the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo,\nSponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Representatives of management reviewed management\u2019s then-updated\nbusiness plan, including the unaudited financial prospective financial information for fiscal years 2022 through 2024\nincluded in the business plan as of September 2022 (which we refer to as the \u201cSeptember 2022 business plan\u201d).\nAdditional information about the preparation and substance of the September 2022 business plan is contained in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The ForgeRock Board\nauthorized sharing the September 2022 business plan with interested potential acquirors. The September 2022\nbusiness plan was provided to Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B in due diligence, and also J.P. Morgan for\npurposes of its ongoing financial analyses.\nOn September 15, 2022, representatives of Sponsor C informed Mr. Rosch that Sponsor C was not interested in\npursuing a strategic transaction with ForgeRock at that time.\nOn September 15, 2022, representatives of management met with representatives of Thoma Bravo to review the\nSeptember 2022 business plan and to discuss general updates to ForgeRock\u2019s business since July 2022. Thereafter,\nand until the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement, Thoma Bravo and its representatives engaged in\ndue diligence and discussions with ForgeRock, which included multiple meetings with members of ForgeRock\nmanagement, members of the Strategic Committee and representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss ForgeRock\u2019s\nbusiness and a potential acquisition of ForgeRock.\nLater on September 15, 2022, Sponsor A submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $23.15 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cSponsor A\nproposal\u201d).\nOn September 16, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an update on the due diligence information made available to, and\ndiscussions with, the potentially interested acquirors, including Sponsor A, Sponsor B and Sponsor C. Mr. Rosch\nnoted that management expected that Thoma Bravo may make an updated proposal the following week.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan discussed with the Strategic Committee a preliminary financial analysis of the\nSponsor A proposal. The Strategic Committee discussed the uncertain status of Sponsor B, which had indicated it\nremained interested in pursuing a potential transaction with ForgeRock, but required additional due diligence before\nit could make a proposal. With respect to the Sponsor A proposal, the Strategic Committee authorized the\nrepresentatives of management and J.P. Morgan to inform Sponsor A that its proposal was too low for the ForgeRock\nBoard to find compelling, and to inquire what additional due diligence Sponsor A required to raise its bid. On\nSeptember 16, 2022, Mr. Rosch, together with representatives of J.P. Morgan, communicated this information to\nSponsor A.\nOn September 19, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock for $21.75 per share (which we refer to as the \u201cSeptember\nproposal\u201d). The September proposal also replaced the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision previously proposed by Thoma Bravo\nwith a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision that would restrict ForgeRock from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals after\nsigning a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma Bravo.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn September 20, 2022, Sponsor A was granted access to a virtual data room hosted by ForgeRock to share due\ndiligence information. On September 22, 2022, Sponsor B was granted access to the virtual data room. On September\n25, 2022, Thoma Bravo was granted renewed access to the virtual data room.\nOn September 21, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. Mr. Rosch provided an overview of discussions with Thoma Bravo and Sponsor A, including\nthat Sponsor A had indicated it was considering the submission of a revised proposal above $24.00 per share.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and a member of the Strategic Committee reviewed similar discussions each had\nseparately had with senior representatives of Sponsor A. The Strategic Committee discussed the unsolicited\noutreach from Sponsor D. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee that Sponsor D was unlikely to\nsuccessfully pursue a full acquisition of ForgeRock on an acceptable timeline. The Strategic Committee discussed\npotential execution risks to achieving ForgeRock\u2019s September 2022 business plan, including current market and\nindustry conditions and challenges to attracting and retaining personnel. The Strategic Committee instructed\nmanagement and J.P. Morgan to (1) continue to encourage Sponsor A to submit a revised proposal\u037e (2) continue to\nprovide Sponsor B with sufficient due diligence to enable it to make a proposal\u037e and (3) inform Thoma Bravo that the\nSeptember proposal was too low for the ForgeRock Board to find acceptable, and, as necessary, facilitate additional\ndue diligence in order for Thoma Bravo to submit an increased proposal.\nOn September 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Mr. Rosch met with a senior representative of Thoma\nBravo. At the meeting, Mr. Rosch informed Thoma Bravo that the September proposal was too low for the ForgeRock\nBoard to accept.\nOn September 22, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan met with representatives of Sponsor B. At this meeting,\nSponsor B indicated that it would need additional time to complete diligence and to decide whether it would pursue\nan acquisition of ForgeRock.\nOn September 26, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A\nand Sponsor B. The Strategic Committee discussed the uncertainty of Sponsor B\u2019s status. The representatives of J.P.\nMorgan reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the September proposal and the Sponsor A proposal. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed certain potential execution and regulatory risks to completing a potential\ntransaction with each of Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B, and the key terms of a proposed merger agreement\nthat would be provided to such parties should the ForgeRock Board decide to proceed.\nOn September 27, 2022, Mr. Rosch gave a management presentation regarding ForgeRock to Sponsor A\u2019s investment\ncommittee.\nOn September 29, 2022 and September 30, 2022, each of Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan separately met\nwith a senior representative of Sponsor A. During each meeting, the representative of Sponsor A indicated that\nSponsor A was unable to support a proposal at or above the original Sponsor A proposal of $23.15 per share. The\nrepresentative of Sponsor A also indicated to Mr. Rosch that Sponsor A expected that any further proposal by\nSponsor A would be closer to $21.00 per share.\nOn September 29, 2022, Mr. Rosch met with senior representatives of Thoma Bravo. The representatives of Thoma\nBravo indicated that Thoma Bravo was (1) ready to proceed with an acquisition of ForgeRock\u037e (2) open to\nnegotiating the purchase price\u037e and (3) willing to provide an equity financing commitment for the entire aggregate\npurchase price of the acquisition (i.e., a full \u201cequity backstop\u201d). A senior representative of Thoma Bravo delivered the\nsame message to representatives of J.P. Morgan during a meeting on September 29, 2022.\nOn September 30, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the status of discussions with Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A\nand Sponsor B. Mr. Rosch noted that based on the lack of urgency with which Sponsor B was moving, it was unlikely\nthat Sponsor B would make a proposal to acquire ForgeRock. The Strategic Committee also discussed the possibility\nof entering into exclusive negotiations with a potential acquiror. The Strategic Committee authorized J.P. Morgan and\nmanagement to (1) instruct each of Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor B to submit \u201cfinal\u201d proposals by October\n3, 2022\u037e (2) inform the parties that ForgeRock would be willing to enter into exclusivity for a limited period with\nrespect to acquisition proposals at a purchase price of $24.00 per share of our common stock\u037e and (3) provide the\nparties an overview of ForgeRock\u2019s preliminary results of operations for the third quarter of 2022\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto support ForgeRock seeking increased acquisition proposals. Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan\nsubsequently communicated the ForgeRock Board\u2019s message regarding price and provided an overview of\nForgeRock\u2019s preliminary results of operations for the third quarter of 2022 to Thoma Bravo, Sponsor A and Sponsor\nB.\nOn October 1, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that Thoma Bravo had completed financial\ndue diligence and was prepared to move expeditiously to sign and announce a transaction.\nOn October 1, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a non-binding indication of interest to the ForgeRock Board to acquire\nall of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $23.00 per share (which we refer to as the\n\u201cfirst October proposal\u201d). The first October proposal contemplated (1) a full \u201cequity backstop\u201d of the purchase price\u037e\nand (2) that ForgeRock enter into exclusivity with Thoma Bravo through October 6, 2022.\nLater on October 1, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee instructed management and representatives of J.P. Morgan to make a\ncounterproposal for Thoma Bravo to acquire ForgeRock at a purchase price of $23.50 per share. Still later on October\n1, 2022, Mr. Rosch, together with representatives of J.P. Morgan, conveyed this counterproposal to Thoma Bravo.\nOn October 1 and October 2, 2022, each of Mr. Rosch and representatives of J.P. Morgan separately met with a senior\nrepresentative of Sponsor A. During each meeting, Sponsor A indicated that Sponsor A was unable to make a\nproposal at or above the original Sponsor A proposal of $23.15 per share.\nOn October 2, 2022, Thoma Bravo submitted a revised proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our\ncommon stock for $23.25 per share. Thoma Bravo informed Mr. Rosch that this represented Thoma Bravo\u2019s \u201cbest and\nfinal\u201d offer (which we refer to as the \u201cfinal Thoma Bravo proposal\u201d). The final Thoma Bravo proposal also\ncontemplated that ForgeRock enter exclusivity with Thoma Bravo through October 6, 2022.\nLater on October 2, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson\nSonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee reviewed (1) the final Thoma Bravo proposal\u037e and (2) the status of\nnegotiations with each of Sponsor A and Sponsor B. Mr. Rosch noted that Sponsor B had been unresponsive to\nrequests to submit a proposal by October 3, 2022. The representatives of J.P. Morgan left the meeting. The\nrepresentatives of management reviewed potential execution risks to achieving ForgeRock\u2019s September 2022\nbusiness plan. The representatives of management then left the meeting and the Strategic Committee continued to\ndiscuss the final Thoma Bravo proposal in executive session. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with\nthe Strategic Committee members their fiduciary duties and potential execution and regulatory risks to completing a\ntransaction with Thoma Bravo. It was the consensus of the Strategic Committee to enter into exclusive negotiations\nwith Thoma Bravo based on the final Thoma Bravo proposal. In making its determination, the Strategic Committee\nconsidered, among other things, (1) the fact that Sponsor A was not prepared to submit a revised proposal at or\nabove the original Sponsor A proposal\u037e (2) the uncertainty around Sponsor B's status, and the low likelihood that\nSponsor B would submit any acquisition proposal, let alone a proposal that the ForgeRock Board would consider\nattractive\u037e (3) the outreach that ForgeRock had conducted to other potential acquirors\u037e (4) ForgeRock\u2019s prospects as\na stand-alone company\u037e (5) certain potential benefits and risks to completing a transaction with Thoma Bravo\u037e and (6)\nthe uncertainty in the debt financing markets, and Thoma Bravo\u2019s commitment to provide a full \u201cequity backstop\u201d for\nthe purchase price. Representatives of management and J.P. Morgan rejoined the meeting. The Strategic Committee\ndirected management to work with Wilson Sonsini and J.P. Morgan to negotiate the terms of the draft merger\nagreement, with the objective of reaching a potential definitive agreement for an acquisition of ForgeRock by Thoma\nBravo during the exclusivity period. The Strategic Committee reviewed the material terms of a proposed engagement\nletter with J.P. Morgan to memorialize the terms of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement as financial advisor to ForgeRock, and\napproved ForgeRock\u2019s entry into such engagement letter on the terms discussed.\nStill later on October 2, 2022, ForgeRock entered into exclusivity with Thoma Bravo until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on\nOctober 6, 2022. Thereafter, ForgeRock provided a draft merger agreement to Thoma Bravo as prepared by Wilson\nSonsini. The draft merger agreement provided for a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent in the event the\nmerger agreement was terminated in certain circumstances at a time when the applicable regulatory approvals\nrequired to complete the merger had not been obtained.\nStill later on October 2, 2022, ForgeRock entered into an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan with respect to J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s engagement as financial advisor to ForgeRock.\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFollowing delivery of the draft merger agreement, representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis LLP (which\nwe refer to as \u201cKirkland & Ellis\u201d), legal counsel to Thoma Bravo, met regularly to negotiate the terms of the merger\nagreement. The principal areas of negotiation in the merger agreement included (1) the respective efforts required by\nForgeRock and Parent to obtain the required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the merger\u037e (2) the\ninclusion of a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent and the terms on which it might be payable\u037e (3) the\n\u201ctermination date\u201d of the merger agreement and the extensions thereto\u037e (4) the restrictions on ForgeRock\u2019s operation\nof the business prior to the completion of the merger (i.e., the \u201cinterim operating covenants\u201d), including with respect\nto employee and compensation matters\u037e and (5) the conditions to each party\u2019s obligations to close the merger. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Kirkland & Ellis also negotiated the terms of the limited guaranty and the\nequity commitment letter. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Kirkland & Ellis and certain of ForgeRock\u2019s\ndirectors and their affiliated investment funds, together with their representatives, also negotiated the terms of the\nvoting agreements.\nFollowing delivery of the draft merger agreement, Messrs. Rosch and Fernandez met on numerous occasions with\nsenior representatives of Thoma Bravo to negotiate the interim operating covenants of the merger agreement.\nOn October 6, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. Messrs. Rosch and Golden reviewed the status of negotiations of the draft merger agreement with\nThoma Bravo, and the discussions with Sponsor A and Sponsor B prior to entering into exclusivity with Thoma\nBravo. The representatives of J.P. Morgan then joined the meeting and reviewed and discussed J.P. Morgan\u2019s\npreliminary financial analysis of the final Thoma Bravo proposal based on the September 2022 business plan. The\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties and then discussed the key terms\nof the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter. Mr. Rosch confirmed to the ForgeRock Board that neither\nhe nor, to his knowledge, any other member of management had engaged in any discussions with Thoma Bravo\nconcerning any \u201crollover\u201d of any equity stake in ForgeRock in connection with a potential acquisition, or the\npossibility of employment following an acquisition, or the potential terms thereof. The representatives of J.P. Morgan\nand management left the meeting and the ForgeRock Board continued in executive session. The ForgeRock Board\nunanimously approved continuing to pursue a transaction with Thoma Bravo and authorized management to grant\nThoma Bravo one-day exclusivity extensions through October 9, 2022. The ForgeRock Board instructed the\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini to continue to negotiate for the inclusion in the merger agreement of a regulatory\ntermination fee payable by Parent.\nOn October 7, 2022, ForgeRock extended exclusivity with Thoma Bravo until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on October 7,\n2022.\nOn October 8, 2022, Mr. Rosch, and Messrs. Golden and Welsh, on behalf of the Strategic Committee, met with senior\nrepresentatives of Thoma Bravo to negotiate the regulatory provisions in the merger agreement, including the\npotential inclusion of a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent.\nOn October 9, 2022, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of management and Wilson Sonsini in\nattendance. The Strategic Committee discussed the open points in the merger agreement. The Strategic Committee\ndetermined that ForgeRock would accept not including a regulatory termination fee payable by Parent, and seek to\nfinalize the other remaining provisions of the merger agreement.\nOn October 9, 2022, the ForgeRock Board met, with representatives of management, J.P. Morgan and Wilson Sonsini\nin attendance. Mr. Golden summarized the status of negotiations with Thoma Bravo with respect to the regulatory\nprovisions, the interim operating covenants and other terms of the draft merger agreement, noting the Strategic\nCommittee\u2019s recommendation that the ForgeRock Board proceed without a regulatory termination fee payable by\nParent in the merger agreement. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the ForgeRock\nBoard their fiduciary duties. The representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed and discussed J.P. Morgan\u2019s financial\nanalysis of the consideration to be paid by Thoma Bravo in the merger, noting that J.P. Morgan was prepared to\nrender its opinion that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, limitations,\nqualifications and other factors that would be set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to be\npaid to the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of\nview, to such holders. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the remaining key terms of the merger\nagreement and the equity commitment letter. The ForgeRock Board authorized the representatives of management, J.P.\nMorgan and Wilson Sonsini to finalize negotiation of the merger agreement with Thoma Bravo, under the supervision\nof the Strategic Committee and consistent with the terms presented to the ForgeRock Board.\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn October 10, 2022, the merger agreement, equity commitment letter, limited guaranty, voting agreements and other\ntransaction documents were finalized.\nLater on October 10, 2022, the representatives of J.P. Morgan delivered, together with a copy of the financial analysis\nreviewed and discussed by J.P. Morgan with the ForgeRock Board on October 9, 2022, J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion\nto the ForgeRock Board, dated October 10, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions, limitations, qualifications and other factors set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in\ncash to be paid to the holders of shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders.\nOn the evening of October 10, 2022, the members of the ForgeRock Board, by unanimous written consent: (1)\ndetermined that the merger agreement and the transactions, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best\ninterests of ForgeRock and our stockholders\u037e (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by\nForgeRock, the performance by ForgeRock of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation\nof the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein\u037e (3) recommended that the stockholders\nof ForgeRock adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby\u037e and (4) directed that\nthe adoption of the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of ForgeRock at a meeting\nthereof.\nOvernight on October 10, 2022, ForgeRock and Thoma Bravo executed the merger agreement and delivered the\nexecuted voting agreements, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty.

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of the ForgeRock Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the ForgeRock Board\nOn October 10, 2022, the ForgeRock Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the\ntransactions, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and its stockholders\u037e\n(2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by ForgeRock, the performance by ForgeRock of its\ncovenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the\nconditions set forth therein\u037e (3) recommended that the stockholders of ForgeRock adopt the merger agreement and\napprove the transactions contemplated thereby\u037e and (4) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be\nsubmitted for consideration by the stockholders of ForgeRock at a meeting thereof.\nThe ForgeRock Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by ForgeRock to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or\ndates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger\nagreement at the time of the special meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the ForgeRock Board consulted with ForgeRock management, as\nwell as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and J.P. Morgan. In recommending that ForgeRock stockholders\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement, the ForgeRock Board considered and analyzed a number of\nfactors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based\non these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the ForgeRock Board\nconcluded that entering into the merger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of ForgeRock and\nour stockholders.\nThe ForgeRock Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination and\nrecommendation:\n\u2022\nBusiness, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The ForgeRock Board considered the\ncurrent and historical and financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive positioning\n43TABLE OF CONTENTS\nof ForgeRock, as well as ForgeRock\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company. In\nparticular, the ForgeRock Board considered management\u2019s then current business plan, including the\nSeptember 2022 business plan. Additional information about the preparation and substance of the\nSeptember 2022 business plan is contained in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited\nProspective Financial Information.\u201d The ForgeRock Board considered these plans and the potential\nopportunities that they presented against, among other various execution and other risks to achieving\nmanagement\u2019s business plan and related uncertainties, including (1) the likelihood that management\u2019s\nbusiness plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short and long term,\nincluding the ability to maintain management\u2019s growth targets\u037e (2) the impact of market, customer and\ncompetitive trends on ForgeRock\u037e and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to market\nconditions that could reduce the price of our Class A common stock. Among the potential risks identified\nby the ForgeRock Board were:\n\u25cb\nForgeRock\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included among\nthese risks were consideration of (1) ForgeRock\u2019s size, as well as its financial resources, relative to\nthose of its competitors\u037e (2) new and evolving competitive threats\u037e (3) challenges to acquiring new\ncustomers or retaining our existing customers\u037e (4) challenges to attracting and retaining personnel\u037e\nand (5) other factors affecting the revenues, operating costs and profitability of companies in\nForgeRock\u2019s industry generally and other risk factors described in ForgeRock\u2019s other filings with the\nSEC, as listed in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d\n\u25cb\nThe current market and industry conditions, including international, national and local economic\nconditions, the current environment in the enterprise identity security industry, the likely effect of\nthese factors on ForgeRock and the execution of ForgeRock\u2019s plans as a standalone public company,\nand the possibility that market and industry conditions-for ForgeRock and the larger economy- will\nnot improve and could get worse.\n\u25cb\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly traded\ncompany, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance. The ForgeRock Board was\naware that the price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted if ForgeRock failed to\nmeet investor expectations, including if ForgeRock failed to meet its growth objectives.\n\u25cb\nThe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of ForgeRock\u2019s\nClass A common stock.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic review\nprocess overseen by the Strategic Committee. The ForgeRock Board considered that, at ForgeRock\u2019s\ndirection, representatives of J.P. Morgan, together with representatives of ForgeRock management and the\nForgeRock Board, affirmatively contacted four potential strategic acquirers and four financial sponsors (in\naddition to Thoma Bravo) concerning their interest in an acquisition of ForgeRock. The ForgeRock Board\nconsidered the nature of the engagement by each of these potential acquirers over several weeks and that,\nof these potential acquirers, only Sponsor A made a proposal for an acquisition of ForgeRock, which was\nultimately lower than the per share merger consideration.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by our stockholders in the\nmerger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured against the ongoing business\nand financial execution risks of management\u2019s business plan. The receipt of cash consideration eliminates\nuncertainty and risk for our stockholders related to the continued execution of ForgeRock\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the ForgeRock Board that the per share merger\nconsideration represents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of our common stock, taking\ninto account the ForgeRock Board\u2019s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business strategy,\nassets, liabilities and general financial condition of ForgeRock on a historical and prospective basis. In\naddition, the ForgeRock Board believed that, measured against the longer-term execution risks described\nabove, the per share merger consideration reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of our common\nstock. The ForgeRock Board also considered that the per share merger consideration constitutes (1) a\npremium of approximately 53% over ForgeRock\u2019s closing share price on October 10, 2022, the last full\ntrading day prior to the transaction announcement, and (2) a premium of approximately 44% over the\nvolume weighted average price of ForgeRock stock for the 30 days ending October 10, 2022.\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the ForgeRock Board that none of the possible\nalternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate ForgeRock as an independent\ncompany or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives,\nas well as the potential benefits and risks to ForgeRock\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives and the timing\nand likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for us\nto create greater value for our stockholders, taking into account execution risks as well as business,\ncompetitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of J.P. Morgan. The written opinion of J.P. Morgan delivered to the ForgeRock Board,\ndated October 10, 2022, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions,\nlimitations, qualifications and other factors set forth therein, the per share consideration of $23.25 in cash to\nbe paid to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial\npoint of view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-",

The following summary does not constitute any\nlegal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights\nunder Section 262. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL TEXT OF SECTION 262 AS\nWELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. \n61TABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock or beneficial owners\nwho (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock to ForgeRock prior\nto the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption\nof the merger agreement\u037e (3) continuously hold of record or beneficially own such shares on the date of making the\ndemand for appraisal through the effective time of the merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and\nsatisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of our common\nstock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of the consideration set\nforth in the merger agreement, for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of\nvalue arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of\nthe judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the amount determined to be\nthe fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to each person entitled to appraisal\nprior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described further below. However, after an appraisal\npetition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights,\nwill dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares of a class or series of stock that, immediately prior to the\nclosing of the merger, were listed on a national securities exchange who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (A) the total number of shares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or\nperfected exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in accordance with\nsubsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1\nmillion. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Given that the shares of our Class A common\nstock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the\nmerger), then the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of our Class A\ncommon stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is satisfied.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on the\namount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount\nrate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time before\nthe entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person\nentitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount\nso paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash\npayment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record\ndate for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 or\ninformation directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be\naccessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes ForgeRock\u2019s notice to our stockholders that\nappraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is available at the\nfollowing URL: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the merger, any\nholder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such\nholder\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of\nSection 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who\nloses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement\nwithout interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising\nthe right to seek appraisal of shares of our common stock, ForgeRock believes that if a person is considering\nexercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common\nstock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nsuch person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch person must deliver to ForgeRock a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger\nagreement at the special meeting\u037e\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsuch person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of our common stock from the\ndate of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a person will lose appraisal rights if the\nperson transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger)\u037e and\n\u2022\nsuch person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding\na determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of\nthe merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of\ndoing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine\npersons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who asserted appraisal rights\nwith respect to the shares of our Class A common stock unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote\nagainst the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.\nFiling Written Demand\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to ForgeRock, before the vote on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. In addition, that\nperson must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail or via the Internet or\ntelephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any\npreviously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising appraisal rights must hold, beneficially or of\nrecord, the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares through\nthe effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the\nstockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a\nstockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing\ninstructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the\nmerger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing\nto vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal\nsatisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from\nany proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger\nagreement will not constitute a demand. A person\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote\non the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nIn the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably inform\nForgeRock of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand must\nreasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made, be accompanied by documentary\nevidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of such stock and a statement that such documentary\nevidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which such beneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by the surviving corporation and to be set forth on the Verified List (as defined\nbelow).\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nForgeRock, Inc.\n201 Mission Street, Suite 2900\nSan Francisco, California 94105\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and accept\nthe per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding\ntaxes, by delivering to ForgeRock, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to\nany person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon\nsuch terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(which we refer to as a \u201cReservation\u201d) for any Application (as defined below)\u037e provided, however, that this shall not\naffect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named\nparty to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the\neffective time of the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal\nproceeding with respect to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such\nappraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered\npursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify\neach stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly made a written\ndemand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any person who\nhas complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an\nappraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncorporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not\nassume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nthe shares of our common stock. Accordingly, any persons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate\nall necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock within the time and\nin the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262\ncould nullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements for an\nappraisal of such person\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the\nsurviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of\nthe merger agreement and with respect to which ForgeRock has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that where a beneficial owner\nmakes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate\nstockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate number). Such statement must be given within ten\ndays after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the\nexpiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy\nthereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service\nto file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing\nthe names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as\nto the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time\nand place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the surviving corporation and all of the persons shown on\nthe Verified List at the addresses stated therein. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.\nAfter notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the hearing on\nsuch petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with Section 262 and\nwho have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons\nwho demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock certificates to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any\nperson fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such\nperson. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal\nproceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Verified List may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights\nunder Section 262.\n64\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGiven that the shares Class A common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (and assuming such shares\nremain so listed up until closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal\nproceedings as to all holders of shares of our Class A common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to our Class A\ncommon stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking\nappraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be\npaid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of\npayment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date\nof the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time\nprior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to\neach person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection\n(h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount paid\nby the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in\nan appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the\ndate of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair\nvalue is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In\nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that]\ndoes not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value\narising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that\n\u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the\ndate of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive\npursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm\nas to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and\nmay not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. ALTHOUGH FORGEROCK BELIEVES THAT THE\nPER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF\nFAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD\nRECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN APPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR\nLOWER THAN, OR THE SAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither ForgeRock nor Parent anticipates offering\nmore than the per share price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of ForgeRock and Parent reserves\nthe rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal\nproceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the per\nshare price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to our Class A common stock, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of persons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an\nappraisal will cease.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any,\nby the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such person upon such\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nterms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be\nenforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts)\nmay be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndeems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the Verified List who\nparticipated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith (which we refer to as an \u201cApplication\u201d),\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the\nshares entitled to an appraisal that were not dismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award\npursuant to a Reservation. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,\nor loses or validly withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of our common stock will be\ndeemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share price as\nprovided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if\nno petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership\nthresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our\nClass A common stock, or if the person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance\nwith Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with\nSection 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of\ndividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an\nappraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been\nsatisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our Class A common stock, or if\nsuch person delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for an appraisal and\nan acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, then the right of such person to an\nappraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nbe dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such\nterms as the Court deems just, including, without limitation, a Reservation\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing\nshall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as\na named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger\nwithin 60 days after the effective date of the merger.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of appraisal rights.\nIn that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the\nmerger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person wishing to\nexercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be\nrelevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders of shares of our common stock whose shares are converted into the\nright to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n(which we refer to, as amended, the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions,\npublished positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable\nauthorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing\ninterpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our\ncommon stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as property held for\ninvestment purposes).\n66TABLE OF CONTENTS\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may\nbe relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S.\nfederal income tax laws, such as financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S corporations,\npartnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders\nin securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities\u037e regulated\ninvestment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e\nholders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d for purposes of Sections 1045\nand 1202 of the Code, as \u201cSection 1244 stock\u201d within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through\nindividual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts\u037e Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution)\nmore than five percent of our common stock\u037e or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term\nresidents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle\nor other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction\nor pursuant to the exercise of ForgeRock options, or ForgeRock RSUs\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other\nentity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income\nwith respect to the shares of our common stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial\nstatement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nany U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences\u037e\n\u2022\nany state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of\ntheir shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such\npartnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.\nPartnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding\nthe consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger\ndescribed below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would\nultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered with\nrespect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME\nTAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of\none or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has a valid election\nin effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is\nneither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a\ntaxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares\nsurrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.\nHolder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if\nsuch U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A\nreduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder\n(including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different\nblocks of shares of our common stock at different times and/or different prices, such holder must determine its\nadjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.\nSubject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain realized\nby a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States\n(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained\nby such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,\nsuch gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\nincome tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the\ntaxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case\nsuch gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable\nincome tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nForgeRock is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in\nSection 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year\nperiod preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares\nof our common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of our common stock are\nregularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code),\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our common\nstock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the\nbranch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its U.S. real\nproperty interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its\nworldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this\npurpose, U.S. real property interests generally include land, improvements\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nand associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we\nare not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-\nU.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to\nthem if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a\nholder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS\nForm W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-\nU.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b)\notherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any\namounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S. federal\nincome tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the\nmerger.\nAdditional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance issued\nthereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain\npayments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules) unless such institution\nenters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the\nU.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which include\ncertain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with\nU.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain\npayments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification\nidentifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental\nagreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under\ncertain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department recently released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would\neliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common\nstock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may\ngenerally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible\nimplications of FATCA on the disposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED FOR GENERAL\nINFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH U.S. HOLDER AND NON-U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT SUCH\nHOLDER\u2019S OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RULES DISCUSSED ABOVE\nTO SUCH HOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION\nAND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral Efforts\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one\nhand, and ForgeRock, on the other hand, agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all\nactions, do, or cause to be done, all things and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be\ndone, all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to\nconsummate and make effective the merger, including: (1) seeking to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, orders\nand authorizations from governmental authorities\u037e and (2) making all registrations, declarations and filings with\ngovernmental authorities, in each case that are necessary or advisable to consummate the merger.\n69TABLE OF CONTENTS\nHSR Act\u037e FDI Laws\nUnder the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Parent and ForgeRock file a Notification and Report Form\nwith the FTC and the DOJ, and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.\nForgeRock and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR Act with the\nFTC and the DOJ on October 24, 2022. Following informal discussions with the DOJ, Parent notified the FTC and the\nDOJ that it had elected to withdraw and refile its notification and report form pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 of the HSR\nAct in order to allow the DOJ additional time to review the transaction. Parent\u2019s notification and report form was\nwithdrawn effective as of November 23, 2022, and Parent refiled the notification and report form on November 28,\n2022, at which time a new 30-day waiting commenced period under the HSR Act. Both before and after the expiration\nof the applicable waiting period, the FTC and the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust\ngrounds.\nAdditionally, under the merger agreement, the merger also cannot be completed until Parent submits the filings under\ncertain specified FDI laws and all necessary consents, approvals, and filings have been obtained or made, and/or all\nwaiting periods (including any extensions thereof) (including any timing agreements with applicable governmental\nauthorities) with respect to the consummation of the merger have expired or otherwise have been terminated under\nthe jurisdictions in which those FDI filings were submitted. Parent, in coordination and consultation with ForgeRock,\nsubmitted the specified FDI filings on October 31, 2022.\nForgeRock and Parent have each agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to (1) supply the other (or cause\nthe other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC,\nthe DOJ or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing, including FDI\nfilings, are made\u037e and (2) take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, cause the expiration or termination of the\napplicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act applicable to the merger or receive approval or clearance for any\nFDI filing.\nAdditionally, Parent and Merger Sub have each agreed not to acquire or agree to acquire by merging or by acquiring\nin any other manner, any business of any person or other business organization or division if such business\ncompetes in any material line of business with ForgeRock or its subsidiaries and the entering into a definitive\nagreement relating to the consummation of such transaction would reasonably be expected to (1) impose any material\ndelay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order,\ndeclaration or approval of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the merger or the expiration or\ntermination of any applicable waiting period\u037e (2) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority entering\nan order preventing or materially restraining the consummation of the merger\u037e (3) materially increase the risk of not\nbeing able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise\u037e or (4) materially delay or prevent the consummation of\nthe merger, subject to certain exceptions.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable,\nincluding seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or\nrequiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At\nany time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under\nthe HSR Act, any state could take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action\ncould include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of\nForgeRock or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances.\nSubject to the terms of the merger agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agreed to, if and to the extent necessary\nto obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other antitrust laws or FDI laws applicable to the\nmerger, offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (1) the sale,\ndivestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate (thorough the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any\nand all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,\nproperties, products of business of Parent, ForgeRock and their respective subsidiaries\u037e (2) the termination,\nmodification, or assignment of existing relationships, joint ventures, contracts, or obligations of Parent, ForgeRock,\nand their respective subsidiaries\u037e (3) the modification of any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent,\nForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries\u037e and (4) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent, ForgeRock and\ntheir respective subsidiaries\u037e in each case, so as to allow the consummation of the merger as soon as practicable and\nin any event at least three business days prior to the termination date\u037e provided that Parent and Merger Sub need\nnot, and ForgeRock agreed not to, without the prior written consent of Parent, commit to or effect any action (A) with\n70\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespect to the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,\nproperties, products or businesses of affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub or (B) that, individually or in the aggregate,\nwould, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a material adverse effect to the business, financial condition or\nresults of operations of Parent, ForgeRock, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole.\nParent agreed to oppose any request for the entry of, and seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment,\ndecree, injunction or ruling of any governmental authority that would restrain, prevent, or delay any required\nconsents, clearances, approvals, waivers, actions, waiting period expirations or termination, non-actions or other\nauthorizations applicable to the merger, including by defending through litigation, any action asserted by any person\nin any court or before any governmental authority and by exhausting all avenues of appeal, including appealing\nproperly any adverse decision or order by any governmental authority. In the event the merger agreement is\nterminated under the scenarios described in the third and fourth bullets of the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement,\u201d Parent has agreed to reimburse\nForgeRock for the reasonable and documented advisor costs and expenses of all such actions, including responding\nto any requests for information in connection with any filing made under the antitrust laws, up to an aggregate\namount of $7.5 million.\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it\ngrants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory\nprocess or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even\npreclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a\nsubstantial period of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that\nthese regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these\nregulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the\nmerger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the\nconditions to the merger not being satisfied.",

        "Section Text": "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger\nagreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and\nincorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the merger\nagreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not\ncontain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the\nparties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other\ninformation contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement\n(1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the\nbenefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and\nsupplemental information agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from\nthose generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by\nconfidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by ForgeRock in connection with the merger agreement.\nIn addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of\nallocating contractual risk between ForgeRock and Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as\nfacts. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the\ncircumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the\nrepresentations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise.\nOur stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the\nrepresentations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the\nactual state of facts or condition of ForgeRock, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change\nafter the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the\nmerger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the\nrespective businesses of ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are\neither expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to\nby the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is\ndescribed below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and\nconditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding ForgeRock, Parent, Merger Sub or\ntheir respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the\nmerger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this\ndocument and in our filings with the SEC regarding ForgeRock and our business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub and ForgeRock that is no\nlater than (a) if the last condition to the closing of the merger to be satisfied or waived is related to (i) waiting periods\nor required consents under the HSR Act, (ii) the absence of any order issued by any governmental authority of\ncompetent jurisdiction or any law that, in each case, prevents, materially restrains or materially impairs the\nconsummation of the merger or (iii) requisite consents, approvals and filings under certain specified FDI laws, the\nfifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions\u037e (b) if the last condition to the closing of the\nmerger to be satisfied or waived is any condition except for the ones mentioned in clause (a) above, the third\nbusiness day after the satisfaction or waiver of such condition (in each case, other than those conditions that by\ntheir terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such\nconditions)\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by ForgeRock, Parent and Merger Sub. On the closing date of the\nmerger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided\nunder the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of that certificate of merger, or at a\nlater time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.",

Upon valid termination of the\nmerger agreement under specified circumstances, ForgeRock agreed to pay Parent (or its designee) a termination fee\nof $60.0 million. Specifically, this termination fee will be payable by ForgeRock to Parent if the merger agreement is\nterminated:\n\u2022\nby ForgeRock if (1) ForgeRock has received a superior proposal, (2) the ForgeRock Board authorizes the\nacceptance of a superior proposal and (3) ForgeRock has complied in all material respects with its\nobligations under the alternative solicitation provisions in the merger agreement\u037e or\n\u2022\nby Parent if the ForgeRock Board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger.\nForgeRock also agreed to pay Parent (or its designee) the termination fee in certain circumstances if:\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement is terminated (1) because the merger is not completed by the termination date at a\ntime when our stockholders have not adopted the merger agreement at the special meeting\u037e (2) because of\nForgeRock\u2019s failure to obtain the required approval of our stockholders\u037e or (3) subject to a 45-day cure\nperiod, because ForgeRock breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,\nwarranties or covenants in a manner that would cause the related closing conditions to not be satisfied\u037e\n\u2022\nat the time of such termination, Parent is in compliance with certain covenants under the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nfollowing the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal has been publicly\nannounced or publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned\u037e and\n\u2022\nForgeRock subsequently consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement providing for (and such\nacquisition proposal is subsequently consummated at any time), a transaction involving the acquisition of\nat least 50.1% of its stock or assets within one year of such termination.\nForgeRock is not required to pay the termination fee to Parent on more than one occasion. The merger agreement also\nprovides that ForgeRock, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may specifically enforce the\nobligations under the merger agreement, except that ForgeRock may only cause Parent and Merger Sub to\nconsummate the merger, and Parent to cause the equity financing to be funded pursuant to the equity commitment\nletter, if certain conditions are satisfied.\n94TABLE OF CONTENTS\nSubject to limited exceptions, Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s aggregate liability for monetary damages for breaches of the\nMerger Agreement are capped at $140.0 million, plus certain reimbursement obligations, and ForgeRock\u2019s liability for\nmonetary damages for breaches of the Merger Agreement is capped at $60.0 million, plus any enforcement expenses.\nForgeRock\u2019s receipt of certain reimbursement obligations payable by Parent to the extent owed, ForgeRock\u2019s right to\nenforce the limited guaranty with respect thereto and receive certain other amounts under the merger agreement, and\nForgeRock\u2019s right to specific performance are the sole and exclusive remedies of ForgeRock and its affiliates against\nParent and its affiliates in respect of the merger agreement, the related transaction documents, the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement or such transaction documents, the termination of the merger agreement or\nthe failure to consummate the merger or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach,\ntermination or failure, and, upon payment of the reimbursement obligations, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates will\nhave any further liability or obligation to ForgeRock or any of its affiliates relating to or arising out of the merger\nagreement, the related transaction documents, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or such\ntransaction documents or for any matters forming the basis of such termination, other than in the case of intentional\ncommon law fraud or a willful breach of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no\ncircumstances can ForgeRock receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the\nequity financing to be funded (whether under the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter) and the\noccurrence of the closing, on the one hand, and (1) payment of any monetary damages (including any monetary\ndamages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever or (2) payment of any of the reimbursement obligations by\nParent to ForgeRock, on the other hand.",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) of the consideration to be paid\nto such holders in the proposed merger (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nProject Fortress Parent, LLC (the \u201cAcquiror\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cAgreement\u201d),\namong the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Project Fortress Merger Sub, Inc. (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), the\nCompany will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common\nStock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any\ndirect or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror or Merger Sub, and Dissenting Company Shares (as\ndefined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $23.25 per share in cash (the \u201cConsideration\u201d).\nIn connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated October 10, 2022 of the Agreement\u037e (ii)\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in\nwhich it operates\u037e (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial\nterms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market\nprices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e (v)\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its\nbusiness\u037e and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.\nIn addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or\nappropriate to our inquiry.\nIn giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was\npublicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We\nhave not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company, the Acquiror or Merger Sub under any state or federal laws relating\nto bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived\ntherefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and\nfinancial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such\nanalyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that\nthe definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also\nassumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the\nrelated agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory\nB-1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nor tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We\nhave further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the\nconsummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the\ncontemplated benefits of the Transaction.\nOur opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made\navailable to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion\nand that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock\nin the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to (i) the fairness of any consideration to be paid in\nconnection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of\nthe Company, (ii) the allocation of the aggregate Consideration to be paid to all holders of Company Common Stock\nbetween the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, or the relative fairness of the\nConsideration to the holders of any shares of the Company Common Stock, or (iii) the underlying decision by the\nCompany to engage in the Transaction. We also do not express any opinion as to the voting rights associated with\nthe Class B Common Stock or any governance or other rights of the holders thereof (and have not taken any such\nrights into account in our analysis). Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any\ncompensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons\nrelative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with\nrespect to the fairness of any such compensation.\nWe have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee\nfrom the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed\nTransaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of\nour engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or\ninvestment banking relationships with the Company and certain portfolio companies of Thoma Bravo, L.P. (an affiliate\nof the Acquiror) (\u201cTB\u201d), for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services\nduring such period have included (i) acting as joint lead bookrunner on the Company\u2019s initial public offering in\nOctober 2021 and (ii) providing debt syndication, equity underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio\ncompanies of TB unrelated to the Transaction. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a\nlender under outstanding credit facilities of portfolio companies of TB, for which it receives customary compensation\nor other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the\noutstanding common stock of each of the Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we\nand our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,\nbank loans or other obligations) of the Company, the Acquiror or TB and its portfolio companies for our own account\nor for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities\nor other financial instruments.\nOn the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid\nto the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders.\nThe issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This\nletter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the\npurposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder\nof the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.
