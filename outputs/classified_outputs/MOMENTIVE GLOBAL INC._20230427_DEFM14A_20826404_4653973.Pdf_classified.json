Under the\nmerger agreement, Parent will acquire Momentive for $9.46 in cash per share of Momentive common\nstock (without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes). In order to complete the\nmerger, Momentive\u2019s stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Momentive common\nstock as of the record date must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This\napproval is a condition to the consummation of the merger.

The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your\nshares of Momentive common stock without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your\nshares of Momentive common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit\na proxy as soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Momentive?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Momentive by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement is approved by Momentive\u2019s stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger\nagreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Momentive, with Momentive\ncontinuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Momentive will become a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Parent, and Momentive common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be\ndelisted from the Nasdaq. In addition, Momentive common stock will be deregistered under the\nExchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $9.46 in cash, without interest and less\nany applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Momentive common stock that you own, unless you\nhave properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the\nDGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares\nof Momentive common stock, you will receive $946 in cash in exchange for your shares of Momentive\ncommon stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nHow does the per share price compare to the market price of Momentive common stock?\nA:\nThis amount constitutes a premium of approximately 28 percent to the volume weighted average closing\nprice of Momentive stock for the 10 trading days ending on March 13, 2023, the date the merger\nagreement was executed, and a 46 percent premium to the company\u2019s closing stock price on the day\nprior to media rumors regarding a potential sale on October 19, 2022.\n20TABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat will happen to restricted stock, Momentive RSUs, Momentive restricted stock and\nMomentive options? \nA:\nGenerally speaking, Momentive RSUs, Momentive restricted stock and Momentive options will be\ntreated at the effective time of the merger as follows:\n\u2022\nEach vested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in\ncash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common stock subject\nto such vested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable withholding\ntaxes.\n\u2022\nEach unvested Momentive RSU will be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive\na converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive common stock\nsubject to such unvested Momentive RSU, multiplied by (2) the per share price, less applicable\nwithholding taxes.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere\nYou Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash\npursuant to the merger?\nA:\nFor a U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d), the exchange of Momentive common stock for\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which\ngenerally will require such U.S. holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in\nan amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder in\nthe merger and such U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Momentive common stock\nsurrendered in the merger.\nA Non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Material\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax with respect to the exchange of Momentive common stock for cash in the merger unless\nsuch Non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup\nwithholding tax unless the Non-U.S. holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise\nestablishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor to\ndetermine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own\nparticular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the\nlaws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general\ninformation only and does not constitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of\nmaterial U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger-Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the merger in the second or third quarter of 2023. However, the exact\ntiming of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the\nclosing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of Momentive\u2019s\ncontrol.\nQ:\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period (and\nany extensions thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated, or\nall requisite consents pursuant thereto have been obtained. In addition, the merger cannot be completed\nuntil all approvals and clearances of the relevant governmental authorities under the specified foreign\ndirect investment laws have been obtained.\nMomentive and Parent each filed or caused to be filed the requisite notification forms under the HSR\nAct with the FTC and the DOJ on March 24, 2023. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act\nexpired at 11:59 p.m., California time on April 24, 2023.\nIn addition, Parent, in coordination and consultation with Momentive, submitted the specified foreign\ndirect investment filing in Italy on April 20, 2023 and may submit additional foreign direct investment\nfilings under certain circumstances.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the merger is consummated, Momentive\u2019s stockholders (including beneficial owners of shares of\ncapital stock) who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) continuously hold\ntheir shares of Momentive\u2019s common stock through the effective time of the merger\u037e (3) properly perfect\nappraisal of their shares\u037e (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements as described in\nthis proxy statement\u037e and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal\nwill be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the\nDGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that these\nDGCL if certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied. This means that these\npersons will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive\npayment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in\nits discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the date of\npayment of the judgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash\npayment to each person seeking appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (x) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The\nsurviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of\njudgment. Persons who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of\nlegal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal\nprocess. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this\nproxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding\nappraisal rights, available at the following URL, accessible without subscription or cost, which is\nincorporated herein by reference: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262.\nQ:\nDo any of Momentive\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from\nthose of Momentive stockholders generally? \nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Momentive Board with respect to the proposal to adopt\nthe merger agreement, you should be aware that Momentive\u2019s directors and executive officers may have\ninterests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Momentive\u2019s\nstockholders generally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the\nmerger agreement\u037e and (3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by\nMomentive\u2019s stockholders, the Momentive Board was aware of and considered these interests to the\nextent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital stock of the\nsurviving corporation.\nThe effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of\nthat certificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Parent and\nMerger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).\n37TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEffect on Momentive if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Momentive\u2019s stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for\nany other reason, Momentive\u2019s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Momentive\ncommon stock in connection with the merger.

        "Section Header": "Background of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Momentive Board established a strategic committee of the Momentive Board (which we refer to as the\n\u201cStrategic Committee\u201d) on August 12, 2021 to oversee the exploration and evaluation of potential strategic\nalternatives available to Momentive. The Strategic Committee was formed in light of (1) the potentially\nsignificant workload that could be involved in evaluating potential strategic alternatives\u037e (2) the possibility that\nMomentive management may need feedback and direction on relatively short notice\u037e and (3) the benefits and\nconvenience of having a subset of directors oversee and direct the process of considering potential strategic\nalternatives. The Momentive Board authorized and instructed the Strategic Committee, among other things,\nto (1) oversee and provide assistance to Momentive management and Momentive\u2019s advisors with respect to\nthe exploration, evaluation, consideration, review and negotiation of the terms and conditions of any potential\nstrategic alternative, including a possible sale of Momentive\u037e (2) take such other actions with respect to any\nstrategic alternative as the Strategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable\u037e and (3)\nrecommend to the Momentive Board the actions, if any, that should be taken by Momentive with respect to\nany strategic alternative or transaction. The Momentive Board retained the power and authority to approve\nthe final decision on pursuing a strategic alternative, including a sale of Momentive, and the entry by\nMomentive into a definitive agreement providing for a sale transaction was not conditioned on any specific\nrecommendation by the Strategic Committee. It was also understood that the Momentive Board would\ncontinue to have an active role in the consideration of potential strategic alternatives. The Momentive Board\ndid not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the Strategic Committee in\nconsideration of their service on the Strategic Committee. The Momentive Board also delegated to the\nStrategic Committee the authority to engage, on behalf of Momentive, one or more financial advisors to\nassist in connection with these matters. Upon formation, the Strategic Committee was initially composed of\nSue Decker, as chair of the Strategic Committee, David Ebersman and Brad Smith.\nOn October 28, 2021, Momentive entered into a merger agreement with Zendesk, Inc. (which we refer to as\n\u201cZendesk\u201d) providing for the acquisition of Momentive by Zendesk (which we refer to as the\n\u201cZendesk merger agreement\u201d) in a stock-for-stock transaction. The entry by Momentive into the Zendesk\nmerger agreement was the result of a process conducted by Momentive and overseen by the Momentive\nBoard and the Strategic Committee to solicit interest regarding a strategic transaction involving Momentive\nfrom a number of potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors (the \u201c2021 solicitation process\u201d).\nAdditional information regarding the 2021 solicitation process and the Zendesk merger agreement was\npublicly disclosed by Momentive in the definitive proxy statement filed by Momentive on January 7, 2022\nwith the SEC in connection with Momentive\u2019s solicitation of proxies from Momentive stockholders to adopt\nthe Zendesk merger agreement, and the other documents filed by Momentive with the SEC. The terms used\nin this proxy statement to refer to counterparties with which Momentive engaged do not correspond to terms\nused to refer to the counterparties that participated in the 2021 solicitation process as described in the\ndefinitive proxy statement filed by Momentive on January 7, 2022. Momentive common stock closed trading\nat a price of $20.61 on October 6, 2021, the day prior to media reports that Momentive was exploring\noptions, including a potential sale after receiving takeover interest. Momentive common stock closed trading\nat a price of $24.92 per share on October 28, 2021, prior to the announcement of Momentive\u2019s entry into the\nZendesk merger agreement following the close of trading on October 28, 2021, and closed trading at $22.92\nper share on October 29, 2022, the first trading day after the announcement of Momentive\u2019s entry into the\nZendesk merger agreement.\nOn February 25, 2022, Zendesk terminated the Zendesk merger agreement after Zendesk\u2019s stockholders\nfailed to approve the issuance of shares of Zendesk common stock to Momentive stockholders as\nconsideration in connection with the acquisition.

The\nStrategic Committee met with several potential advisors to consider their candidacy for this role.\nIn addition, from time to time following the termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, representatives of\ncertain financial sponsors that had participated in the 2021 solicitation process contacted Zander Lurie,\nMomentive\u2019s chief executive officer, to discuss Momentive\u2019s business.

Qatalyst Partners provided an initial draft of an engagement\nletter with respect to the engagement on March 29, 2022.\nOn March 28, 2022, Financial Sponsor A delivered a written, non-binding indication of interest to the\nMomentive Board expressing its interest in acquiring Momentive at an unspecified market premium to the\nthen-current market price of Momentive common stock.

In this regard, the Strategic Committee noted that the\nadverse impacts would be heightened due to the recent termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, and\nthe increase in the likelihood of those risks if Momentive were to engage extensively with Financial Sponsor\nA or engage in a broader private or public process. The Strategic Committee determined to recommend to\nthe Momentive Board that Momentive engage with Financial Sponsor A to understand whether it would,\nfollowing access to Momentive management and non-public information, be in a position to quickly submit a\nmore specific acquisition proposal.

In this regard, the Strategic Committee noted that the adverse impacts would be heightened\ndue to the recent termination of the Zendesk merger agreement, and the increase in the likelihood of those\nrisks if Momentive were to engage extensively with Financial Sponsor A or engage in a broader private or\npublic process. The Strategic Committee delivered its recommendation that Momentive engage with\nFinancial Sponsor A, allowing access to Momentive management and non-public information, to understand\nwhether it would be in a position to quickly submit a more specific acquisition proposal. Following\ndiscussion, the Momentive Board authorized engaging with Financial Sponsor A and providing due diligence\ninformation, including Momentive\u2019s updated long-range plan, to Financial Sponsor A in order to understand\nwhether it would submit a more specific acquisition proposal.

The Strategic Committee noted that Financial\nSponsor A had not submitted an acquisition proposal, the headwinds and trends in Momentive\u2019s industry\nand business, and the volatility in the price of Momentive common stock and companies in the technology\nsector generally that would make an agreement on a potential acquisition price more challenging.

Representatives of Qatalyst Partners presented\na preliminary financial overview of the valuations for Momentive proposed by Financial Sponsor A and\nFinancial Sponsor C, as well as certain market perspectives on Momentive. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners reviewed various strategic acquirors and financial sponsors that Momentive might consider\ncontacting based on those parties\u2019 likely or previously expressed interest in a potential strategic transaction\nwith Momentive as part of the 2021 solicitation process and following the termination of the Zendesk merger\nagreement and their respective abilities to finance and consummate a transaction. The Strategic Committee\ndiscussed timing and process considerations in an outreach process. The Strategic Committee also\ndiscussed the potential risks\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof an outreach, including Momentive management and employee distraction and adverse impacts on\nMomentive\u2019s business and employee morale if a transaction was pursued but not consummated, and the\nincrease in the likelihood of those risks in a wider private or public process relative to a more targeted\noutreach. The Strategic Committee expressed a belief that a wider process would not be necessary given\nthat Momentive\u2019s interest in a potential acquisition would be widely known in light of the 2021 solicitation\nprocess and recent media reports that Momentive was considering a sale. Following discussion, the\nStrategic Committee (1) directed Qatalyst Partners to inform Financial Sponsor C that it needed to improve\nthe terms of its proposal\u037e (2) determined to permit Financial Sponsor A to conduct additional due diligence in\norder to provide a firm acquisition proposal\u037e and (3) directed Qatalyst Partners to commence an outreach to\na group of other potential acquirers, to be selected by Ms. Decker in consultation with Qatalyst Partners\nand based on the feedback received in the meeting. Following the meeting, based on Ms. Decker\u2019s\nconsultation with Qatalyst Partners, 11 financial sponsors (which included Financial Sponsor B and\nFinancial Sponsor D, but did not include STG) and 4 potential strategic acquirors (which did not include\nZendesk or Strategic A) were designated to engage with as part of the outreach process, in addition to\nFinancial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C. Following the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners\ncontacted representatives of Financial Sponsor C to provide feedback on its proposal as directed by the\nStrategic Committee. On that day, Momentive common stock closed trading at a price of $7.46 per share.\nBetween October 21, 2022 and October 25, 2022, in accordance with the directive of the Strategic\nCommittee, representatives of Qatalyst Partners commenced their outreach to the 15 designated additional\npotential counterparties. Over the subsequent two weeks, seven of the 15 additional counterparties entered\ninto a confidentiality agreement with Momentive, while eight of the additional counterparties did not enter into\na confidentiality agreement and declined to engage in discussions or due diligence with respect to a\npotential transaction with Momentive. In addition, Momentive requested at this time that each of Financial\nSponsor A and Financial Sponsor C enter into a new confidentiality agreement with Momentive in order to\nextend the term of their respective confidentiality obligations and because the \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions in their\noriginal confidentiality agreements had terminated upon the announcement of the Zendesk merger\nagreement. The new confidentiality agreement with Financial Sponsor C also included the portfolio company\nof Financial Sponsor C that was proposed as the entity that would acquire Momentive. All of these\nconfidentiality agreements described above, as well as the confidentiality agreements with the other\ncounterparties that made an unsolicited outreach to Momentive as described below, including the\nconfidentiality agreement subsequently entered into with STG, (1) contained \u201cstandstill\u201d provisions restricting\nthe counterparty from making public proposals with respect to the acquisition of Momentive without\nMomentive\u2019s prior consent (but not restricting confidential proposals to the Momentive Board), which\nrestrictions would terminate upon the occurrence of, among other things, Momentive\u2019s execution of a\ndefinitive agreement with a third party to acquire more than 50% of Momentive\u2019s outstanding voting\nsecurities\u037e and (2) restricted the counterparty\u2019s ability to engage with equity or debt financing sources\nregarding a potential transaction without Momentive\u2019s prior consent. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nupdated the Strategic Committee on the status of their outreach to, and responses from, the 15 additional\ncounterparties.\nOn October 21, 2022, representatives of Financial Sponsor D contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nto inform them they would be delivering an acquisition proposal reflecting a \u201cstandard\u201d premium to\nMomentive\u2019s then-current market price. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners responded that they did not\nbelieve that such a valuation would lead to engagement by Momentive with Financial Sponsor D, which\nresponse was consistent with the feedback provided to Financial Sponsor C at the Strategic Committee\u2019s\ndirection. Following this discussion, Financial Sponsor D delivered a written, non-binding proposal to acquire\nMomentive at a price in cash of between $9.00 and $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock based on\npublicly available information.\nAlso beginning on October 25, 2022 and over the course of the subsequent four weeks, Momentive provided\npotential counterparties that had executed a confidentiality agreement, including the additional potential\ncounterparties that engaged with Momentive on an unsolicited basis following the initial outreach by\nQatalyst Partners, as described below, with access to a virtual data room to share operational and financial\ndue diligence information regarding Momentive.

The Strategic Committee discussed negotiation strategies to seek to improve STG\u2019s proposal,\nincluding the possibility of soliciting additional proposals to encourage a competitive bidding dynamic. The\nStrategic Committee also discussed with its advisors financing and closing certainty risks in STG\u2019s\nproposed transaction, and timing and process considerations of a transaction with STG. Following\ndiscussion, the Strategic Committee (1) determined to continue engaging with STG toward a potential\nacquisition, including by providing additional due diligence information, discussed STG\u2019s request to enter\ninto exclusive negotiations with STG with respect to a sale of Momentive, and declined to do so at this time,\nand instructed Qatalyst Partners as part of this engagement to inform STG that Momentive was prepared to\nproceed with discussions with respect to a potential transaction but that they were not prepared to transact\nat a price below $10.50 per share of Momentive common stock\u037e and (2) directed Qatalyst Partners to\ncontact to Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C to inform each of them that Momentive had\nreceived a credible acquisition proposal and offer an opportunity to submit a competing proposal. The\nStrategic Committee believed that Financial Sponsor A and Financial Sponsor C were the counterparties\npotentially most likely to be interested in, and capable of, submitting a competitive acquisition proposal. The\nStrategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of\nQatalyst Partners in attendance, to discuss these matters. Following the meeting, the Strategic Committee\nupdated the Momentive Board on the results of Momentive\u2019s solicitation process to date and next steps.\nBetween December 18 and 21, 2022, in accordance with the directive of the Strategic Committee,\nrepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of STG to inform them that (1) Momentive\nwas prepared to proceed with discussions with respect to a potential transaction, including by providing\nadditional due diligence information, (2) was not prepared to agree to STG\u2019s request for exclusivity, and (3)\nwas not prepared to transact at price below $10.50 per share. Representatives of STG responded that it was\nprepared to move forward with additional diligence at $10.00 per share but could not commit to a higher\nprice. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners informed the members of the Strategic Committee of STG\u2019s\nresponse, including that STG indicated they were unable to commit to a higher price than $10.00 per share.\nThe Strategic Committee determined to proceed with discussions with STG on a non-exclusive basis,\ntoward a potential acquisition.\nOn December 20, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial Sponsor\nA to inform it that Momentive had received a credible acquisition proposal. Financial Sponsor A\nsubsequently declined again to engage in further discussions with Momentive regarding an acquisition.\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on December 20, 2022, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives of Financial\nSponsor C to inform them that Momentive had received a credible acquisition proposal.

Over the course of the following ten weeks,\nSTG and its advisors conducted operational, customer, financial, legal, employment, accounting and other\ndue diligence on Momentive, and from time to time met with members of Momentive management and its\nadvisors regarding the due diligence information.\nOn January 1, 2023, with the approval of the Strategic Committee, Momentive entered into an engagement\nletter with Qatalyst Partners to act as a financial advisor to Momentive in connection with certain\nshareholder activism and governance matters.\nOn January 12, 2023, representatives of STG contacted representatives of Qatalyst to request approval to\ncontact a group of STG\u2019s limited partners to explore their interest in providing potential equity financing for a\ntransaction as co-investors with STG. The representatives of STG stated their belief that its limited partners\ncould provide sufficient equity financing, together with equity financing from funds affiliated with STG and\ndebt financing, to finance the transaction.\nOn January 13, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners provided an update on STG\u2019s due diligence review, and noted that STG would likely require\nadditional time to complete its due diligence and arrange its financing for a transaction, including engaging\nwith its limited partners as potential co-investors.

Following the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided STG with a summary of the\nMarch 2023 long-range plan.\nAlso on March 10, 2023, Momentive received a notice from a stockholder nominating a candidate for\nelection to the Momentive Board at Momentive\u2019s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.\nOn March 11, 2023, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners reviewed the process to solicit proposals conducted by Momentive to date. Representatives of\nQatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with STG,\nincluding the status of Parent\u2019s efforts to secure financing commitments for the merger. In particular,\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini noted that the negotiation of the merger agreement and related transaction\ndocuments was substantially complete, in accordance with the terms previously discussed with the\nStrategic Committee and the Momentive Board, but that the execution of the merger agreement remained\nsubject to the finalization of Parent\u2019s financing commitments. The Strategic Committee discussed the\nimpact of contemporaneous events with respect to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and disruption in the\nU.S. banking sector on Parent\u2019s ability to finalize its financing commitments and execute the merger. The\nStrategic Committee also met in executive session, without Momentive management or representatives of\nQatalyst Partners in attendance, and continued to discuss these matters. Following discussion, the\nStrategic Committee directed representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to finalize the\nforms of the merger agreement and confirm that Parent\u2019s financing commitments had been finalized. The\nStrategic Committee also determined to recommend to the Momentive Board that it adopt and approve the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.\nOn March 12, 2023, representatives of STG communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners that, in\nlight of disruption in the U.S. banking sector and related uncertainty, certain members of the equity\ninvestment consortium and the debt financing sources would not be in a position to confirm their respective\nfinancing commitments until they observed the market reactions to these events on March 13, 2023, and\ntherefore Parent was not in a position to finalize and execute the merger agreement on March 12, 2023.\nLater on March 12, 2023, the Momentive Board met, with members of Momentive management and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners in attendance. Representatives of Qatalyst\nPartners provided an update on the negotiations and discussions with STG, including the fact that Parent\u2019s\nfinancing commitments were not expected to be finalized that day. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners\nalso reviewed the process to solicit proposals conducted by Momentive to date, in which Momentive, with\nthe assistance of Qatalyst Partners, had engaged in discussions with 22 potential counterparties,\nconsisting of 18 financial sponsors and four potential strategic acquirors, 14 of which had entered into\nconfidentiality agreements with Momentive and conducted due diligence, and that had resulted only in the\nproposal from Parent at that time. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also presented to the Momentive\nBoard their financial analysis of the per share price and related financial aspects of the merger.\nRepresentatives of Qatalyst Partners indicated they would be prepared to deliver a written opinion, based on\nthe financial analysis presented at the meeting, that the per share price would be fair, from a financial point\nof view, to the Momentive stockholders if and when requested by the Momentive Board prior to the execution\nof the merger agreement within the next day. The Strategic Committee delivered its recommendation that\nthe Momentive Board adopt and approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement, including the merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of\nthe Momentive Board relevant Delaware law matters, including the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in connection\nwith the merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also reviewed with the Momentive Board the principal\nterms of the merger agreement, the voting agreements, the equity commitment letter and the other\ntransaction documents. The Momentive Board also received from Qatalyst Partners an updated conflict\ndisclosure letter, from which the Momentive Board did not identify matters that would limit Qatalyst Partner\u2019s\nability to fulfill its responsibilities as financial advisor to Momentive. In its review of the merger, the\nMomentive Board\n60\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconsidered various factors, including those described in the section titled \u201c-Momentive\u2019s Reasons for\nthe Merger and Recommendation of the Momentive Board of Directors.\u201d The Momentive Board directed\nrepresentatives of Wilson Sonsini and Momentive management to finalize the forms of the merger agreement\nand related transaction documents.\nOn March 13, 2023, representatives of Paul Hastings provided representatives of Wilson Sonsini an updated\nversion of the debt commitment letter and related documents reflecting revised lending terms, and\nrepresentatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Paul Hastings and members of Momentive management\nconfirmed that the forms of the merger agreement, voting agreements and related transaction documents\nwere final and that Parent had finalized its financing commitments for the merger.\nLater on March 13, 2023, during the trading and prior to the Momentive Board\u2019s approval of the merger\nagreement, upon the request of the Momentive Board, Qatalyst Partners delivered to the Momentive Board\nits written opinion, stating that based on conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis\npresented to the Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various other\nassumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, that the per share price to be\nreceived pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger by the holders of Momentive common\nstock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The\nwritten opinion was revised by Qatalyst Partners following the execution of the merger agreement to be in\nthe form attached to this proxy statement as Annex B to correct a scrivener\u2019s error and to remove\nconfidential identifying information with respect to the members of the equity investment consortium.\nMomentive management also updated the Momentive Board on the discussions with STG and its\nrepresentatives.\nAfter the close of trading on March 13, 2023, the Momentive Board unanimously determined that the merger\nagreement and the merger are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Momentive and its\nstockholders, and declared advisable, adopted and approved in all respects the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and approved the execution and\ndelivery of the merger agreement, the voting agreements the other relevant transaction documents.\nStill later on March 13, 2023, the merger agreement, voting agreements and related transaction documents\nwere executed by the relevant parties, and Momentive publicly announced the merger and the execution of\nthe merger agreement.\nAlso on March 13, 2023, following the announcement of the merger, Momentive received a notice\nwithdrawing the nomination of a director candidate for election that had been submitted on March 10, 2023.",

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of the Momentive Board and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Momentive Board\nOn March 13, 2023, the Momentive Board unanimously: (1) determined that the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of\nMomentive and its stockholders\u037e (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by\nMomentive, the performance by Momentive of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the\nconsummation of the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein\u037e (3)\nrecommended that Momentive stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions\ncontemplated thereby\u037e and (4) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted for\nconsideration by Momentive stockholders at the special meeting.\nThe Momentive Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger\nagreement and approval of the merger\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the compensation that will or may become payable by\nMomentive to its named executive officers in connection with the merger\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of\nthe special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special\nmeeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Momentive Board consulted with Momentive\nmanagement, as well as representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Qatalyst Partners. In recommending\nthat Momentive stockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger,\n61TABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Momentive Board considered and analyzed a number of factors, including the following (which factors\nare not necessarily presented in order of relative importance). Based on these consultations, considerations\nand analyses, as well as the factors discussed below, the Momentive Board concluded that entering into the\nmerger agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Momentive and its stockholders.\nThe Momentive Board believed that the following material factors and benefits supported its determination\nand recommendation:\n\u2022\nBusiness, Financial Condition, Prospects and Execution Risks. The Momentive Board considered\nthe current and historical financial condition, results of operations, business and competitive\npositioning of Momentive, as well as Momentive\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an\npositioning of Momentive, as well as Momentive\u2019s prospects and risks if it were to remain an\nindependent company. In particular, the Momentive Board considered Momentive\u2019s then-current\nbusiness plan, including the March 2023 long-range plan. Additional information about the\npreparation and substance of the March 2023 long-range plan is contained in the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201c-Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.\u201d The Momentive Board\nconsidered the March 2023 long-range plan and the potential opportunities that it presented\nagainst, among other things, various execution and other risks to achieving Momentive\u2019s business\nplan, including (1) the likelihood that the financial and operational results indicated by the March\n2023 long-range plan could be achieved in the face of operational and execution risks in the short\nand long term\u037e (2) the impact of market, industry, customer and competitive trends on, and\nheadwinds to, Momentive\u2019s business\u037e and (3) market volatility and the general risks related to\nmarket and industry conditions that could reduce the price of Momentive common stock. Among\nthe potential risks identified by the Momentive Board were:\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s competitive positioning and prospects as an independent company. Included\namong these risks were consideration of (1) Momentive\u2019s size, as well as its\nfinancial resources, relative to those of its competitors\u037e (2) challenges to attracting and\nretaining sales-assisted and other customers, converting unpaid users to customers, and\ndeveloping and expanding relationships with customers\u037e (3) challenges to hiring and retaining\nkey personnel critical to the execution of Momentive\u2019s business plan\u037e (4) new and\nevolving competitive threats, particularly in light of relatively low barriers to entry into our\nbusiness\u037e and (5) other factors affecting the revenues, operating margin and profitability of\nMomentive and other companies in Momentive\u2019s industry generally and other risk factors\ndescribed in Momentive\u2019s other filings with the SEC, as listed in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s continuing efforts to execute growth initiatives to (1) convert free users to paid\nsubscribers in its self-serve channel\u037e and (2) invest in product innovation and go-to-\nmarket initiatives to expand the percentage of Momentive\u2019s revenue generated through its\nsales-assisted channel. Although the Momentive Board believes that these actions are the\nright strategic decisions for Momentive, there is no assurance that they will be successful or\nresult in a more valuable company. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware that\nMomentive\u2019s sales-assisted channel faced greater costs, longer sales cycles and less\npredictability in generating revenue than its self-serve channel.\n\u25cb\nRecent market volatility and evolving trends and headwinds facing Momentive\u2019s business and\nits industry more generally, including the impact of changed and uncertain\neconomic circumstances on key customer segments and the continuing effect of these\nfactors on Momentive and the execution of Momentive\u2019s plans as an independent public\ncompany.\n\u25cb\nMomentive\u2019s history of fluctuations in revenue growth and the challenges to maintaining\noperating margins in the near term, along with evolving investor expectations regarding\ngrowth and profitability at technology companies.\n\u25cb\nThe challenges of making investments to achieve long-term growth prospects for a publicly\ntraded company, which is subject to scrutiny based on its quarterly performance.\nThe Momentive Board was aware that the price of Momentive common stock could be\nnegatively impacted if Momentive failed to meet investor expectations, including if Momentive\nfailed to meet its growth or profitability objectives.\n62\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\nThe inherent uncertainty of achieving the results reflected in the March 2023 long-range plan.\n\u25cb\nThe historical execution of Momentive\u2019s business plan and publicly disclosed guidance by\nMomentive management. In this regard, the Momentive Board was aware of instances in\nwhich Momentive failed to achieve certain expectations of Momentive\u2019s financial and\noperational performance, and of the impact that these failures had on the price of the\nMomentive common stock.\n\u25cb\nThe historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to shares of\nMomentive common stock.\n\u2022\nResults of Strategic Review Process. The merger was the result of a comprehensive strategic\nreview process overseen by the Strategic Committee. The Momentive Board considered that, with\nthe assistance of Qatalyst Partners, Momentive contacted four potential strategic acquirors and 18\nfinancial sponsors (including STG) concerning their interest in a strategic transaction involving\nMomentive. The Momentive Board considered the nature of the engagement by each of these\npotential acquirors, and that, of these potential acquirors, only STG made a proposal for an\nacquisition of Momentive that was capable of being accepted. The Momentive Board was also\naware that the 2021 solicitation process had attracted considerable media attention and made\nclear that the Momentive Board would consider a potential sale of Momentive and other transaction\nthat maximized stockholder value. Further, the Momentive Board noted that media reports that\nMomentive was pursuing a potential sale prompted numerous unsolicited expressions of interest in\npursuing a potential acquisition of Momentive, but that none of these expressions of interest had\nresulted in a proposal that was capable of being accepted.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration and Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by Momentive\nstockholders in the merger consists entirely of cash, which provides certainty of value measured\nagainst the ongoing business and financial execution risks of Momentive\u2019s business plan. The\nreceipt of cash consideration eliminates uncertainty and risk for Momentive stockholders related to\nthe continued execution of Momentive\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nBest Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Momentive Board that the per share price\nrepresents the best value reasonably obtainable for the shares of Momentive common stock, taking\ninto account the Momentive Board\u2019s familiarity with the business, operations, prospects, business\nstrategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Momentive on a historical and\nprospective basis. In addition, the Momentive Board believed that, measured against Momentive\u2019s\nlonger-term execution risks, the per share price reflects a fair and favorable price for the shares of\nMomentive common stock. The Momentive Board also considered that the per share price\nconstitutes a premium of approximately 28 percent to the volume weighted average closing price of\nMomentive stock for the 10 trading days ending on March 13, 2023, the date the merger agreement\nwas executed, and a 46 percent premium to Momentive\u2019s closing stock price on October 18, 2022,\nthe day prior to media rumors regarding a potential sale. The Momentive Board also considered\nthat the per share price represented the highest price that STG said Parent was capable of paying\nin an acquisition of Momentive.\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives. The assessment of the Momentive Board that none of the possible\nalternatives to the merger (including the possibility of continuing to operate Momentive as an\nindependent public company or pursuing a different transaction, and the desirability and perceived\nrisks of those alternatives, as well as the potential benefits and risks to Momentive stockholders of\nthose alternatives and the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably likely\nto present superior opportunities for Momentive to create greater value for Momentive stockholders,\ntaking into account execution risks as well as business, competitive, financial, industry, legal,\nmarket and regulatory risks.\n\u2022\nFairness Opinion of Qatalyst Partners. The written opinion of Qatalyst Partners delivered to the\nMomentive Board, stating that based on conditions as of March 12, 2023 and the financial analysis\npresented to the Momentive Board on March 12, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various\nother assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, that the per share\nprice to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger by the holders of\n63\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMomentive common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) is fair, from a financial point\nof view, to such holders. The opinion is more fully described in the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201c-",

        "Section Text": "Interests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Momentive Board that you vote to approve the proposal to\nadopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that Momentive\u2019s directors and executive officers may\nhave interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Momentive\u2019s\nstockholders. Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Momentive\u2019s directors,\nin their capacities as Momentive stockholders, entered into the voting agreements with Parent and\nMomentive. The voting agreements obligate these persons to vote their respective shares of Momentive\ncommon stock (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and any action in furtherance of the\nadoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) against any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected\nto result in a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Momentive in the\nmerger agreement\u037e and (3) against any proposal involving Momentive or any of its subsidiaries that would\nreasonably be expected to have a Momentive material adverse effect (as defined in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Representations and Warranties\u201d) or materially impede,\ninterfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the consummation of the merger or any of the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger\nagreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and (3) recommending that the merger\nagreement be adopted by Momentive\u2019s stockholders, the Momentive Board was aware of and considered\nthese interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests are more\nfully described below.\nInsurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and officers of Momentive will be entitled to certain\nongoing indemnification and insurance coverage, including under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance\npolicies.

Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such converted\ncash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as applied\nto the corresponding unvested Momentive RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, with\npayment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.\nFor more information regarding the treatment of Momentive RSUs held by Momentive\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.\u201d\nTreatment of Momentive Restricted Stock\nAs of April 5, 2023, there were 809,314 of shares of Momentive common stock subject to outstanding\nMomentive restricted stock awards, none of which were held by Momentive\u2019s current non-employee directors\nand all of which were held by Momentive\u2019s current executive officers (at maximum target performance for any\nperformance-based Momentive restricted stock award).\nAt the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of Momentive restricted stock will be cancelled\nand converted into the contingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of\nshares of Momentive common stock subject to such outstanding Momentive restricted stock award,\nmultiplied by (2) the per share price, less withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger\nagreement, each such converted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting\nterms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Momentive restricted stock award immediately prior to\nthe effective time of the merger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.\nOn March 13, 2022, we granted Alexander J. Lurie, our chief executive officer, a performance-based\nrestricted stock award (which we refer to as the \u201cLurie restricted stock award\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of\nthe Restricted Stock Award Agreement governing the Lurie restricted stock award (which we refer to as the\n\u201cRestricted Stock Agreement\u201d), the performance period applicable to the Lurie restricted stock award will\nend five business days prior to closing and the compensation committee will determine the number of\nshares eligible to vest (which we refer to as the \u201cLurie eligible shares\u201d) based on Momentive\u2019s total\nstockholder return and the total stockholder return of an index as described in the Restricted Stock\nAgreement. The per share price will be used to calculate Momentive\u2019s total stockholder return. The number\nof Lurie eligible shares will be calculated based on actual performance in accordance with the terms of the\nRestricted Stock Agreement and, per the Restricted Stock Agreement, will be reduced by 19,189 shares\n(the number of Lurie eligible shares that vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described\nin the Restricted Stock Agreement). Upon closing, a pro-rated number of the Lurie eligible shares will vest\nwith such pro-ration calculated by multiplying the number of Lurie eligible shares by a fraction with a\nnumerator equal to the number of completed calendar months that have elapsed between the March 13,\n2022 grant date of the Lurie restricted stock award and the closing, and a denominator of 36. Following\nclosing, the remaining Lurie eligible shares will vest in approximately equal installments on each quarterly\nanniversary of the closing through March 13, 2025, with any remaining unvested Lurie eligible shares vesting\non March 13, 2025. Vesting of the Lurie eligible shares is subject to continued service, but the Lurie eligible\nshares will be eligible for accelerated vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment under Mr. Lurie\u2019s\nchange in control and severance agreement. At 100% of target, 180,704 shares of Momentive common\nstock would become Lurie eligible shares. At maximum performance, 200% of target, or 361,408 shares of\nMomentive common stock would become Lurie eligible shares. For purposes of this disclosure, we have\nassumed that performance will be achieved at 100% of target and 161,515 shares of Momentive common\nstock (the 180,704 shares achieved at 100% of target reduced by the 19,189 shares that vested at the end\nof the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement) will become Lurie\neligible shares. At maximum performance, 342,219 shares of Momentive common stock (361,408 shares\nreduced by the 19,189 shares\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat vested at the end of the one-year performance period as described in the Restricted Stock Agreement)\nwould become Lurie eligible shares.

Momentive options to purchase an aggregate of 896,431\nshares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive\u2019s current non-employee directors, none of\nwhich have an exercise price below the per share price, and Momentive options to purchase an aggregate of\n6,672,237 shares of Momentive common stock were held by Momentive\u2019s current executive officers, of\nwhich 600,000 have an exercise price below the per share price.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each vested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the\nright to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock subject to the vested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share\nprice over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such vested Momentive option,\nless applicable withholding taxes.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each unvested Momentive option will be cancelled and converted into the\ncontingent right to receive a converted cash award equal to (1) the total number of shares of Momentive\ncommon stock subject to such unvested Momentive option, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the per\nshare price over the exercise price per share of Momentive common stock under such unvested Momentive\noption, less applicable withholding taxes. Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, each such\nconverted cash award will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same vesting terms and conditions as\napplied to the corresponding unvested Momentive option immediately prior to the effective time of the\nmerger, with payment forfeited to the extent vesting is not satisfied.\nAny underwater Momentive option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no consideration or\npayment.\nFor more information regarding the treatment of Momentive options held by Momentive\u2019s directors and\nexecutive officers, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cInterests of Momentive\u2019s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Merger-Change in Control and Severance Benefits Under Existing Relationships.\u201d\nTreatment of the ESPP in connection with the Merger\nWe have taken, or will take prior to the effective time of the merger, all action that we determine to be\nreasonably necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the merger, (1) cause any offering period or\npurchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding at the effective time of the merger to\nbe terminated no later than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger\u037e (2) make any\nadjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened offering period or purchase period,\nbut otherwise treat such shortened offering period or purchase period as a fully effective and completed\noffering period or purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP\u037e (3) cause the exercise (as of no\nlater than the closing, but prior to the effective time of the merger) of each outstanding purchase right\npursuant to the ESPP\u037e and (4) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence\npursuant to the ESPP upon or after the effective time of the merger.

On the third anniversary of the\neffective date of the agreement, the agreement will renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless\neither party provides the other party with written notice of nonrenewal at least one-year prior to the date of\nautomatic renewal. However, if a change in control (as defined in the applicable agreement) occurs when\nthere are fewer than 12 months remaining during the initial term or during an additional term, the term of the\nchange in control and severance agreement will extend automatically through the date that is 12 months\nfollowing the date of the change in control.

The following summary does not constitute\nany legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Momentive\u2019s stockholders exercise\ntheir appraisal rights under Section 262. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FULL\nTEXT OF SECTION 262 AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED BELOW. \n83TABLE OF CONTENTS\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of Momentive common stock or\nbeneficial owners who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares of Momentive\ncommon stock to Momentive prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote, in\nperson or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (3) continuously hold of record or\nbeneficially own such shares on the date of making the demand for appraisal through the effective time of\nthe merger\u037e and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth\nin Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares of Momentive common stock appraised by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and to receive payment in cash, in lieu of the consideration set forth in the merger\nagreement, for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of Momentive common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value from the effective time of the merger through the date\nof payment of the judgment (or in certain circumstances described herein, on the difference between the\namount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the surviving corporation in the merger to\neach person entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding) as described\nfurther below. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a\nhearing to determine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all holders\nof shares of a class or series of stock that, immediately prior to the closing of the merger, were listed on a\nnational securities exchange who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (A) the total number of\nshares of the class or series of stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued or perfected exceeds one\npercent of the outstanding shares of such class or series as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of\nSection 262\u037e or (B) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We\nrefer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Given that the shares of Momentive common\nstock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed up until closing of the merger),\nthen the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all holders of Momentive\ncommon stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is\nsatisfied.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest on the amount determined to be the fair value of the shares subject to appraisal will accrue and\ncompound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at five\npercent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time\nduring such period (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving\ncorporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each person entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue\nthereafter only upon the sum of (x) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of\nthe shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest theretofore accrued, unless\npaid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment\nprior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders,\nthe corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as\nof the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a\ncopy of Section 262 or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at\nwhich Section 262 may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes\nMomentive\u2019s notice to Momentive\u2019s stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the\nm e r g e r ,  a n d  t h e  f u l l  t e x t  o f  S e c t i o n  2 6 2  i s  a v a i l a b l e  a t  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  U R L :\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the merger, any holder of\nshares of Momentive common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve\nsuch holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under\nthe DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price\ndescribed in the merger agreement less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the\nprocedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Momentive common stock, Momentive\nbelieves that if a person is considering exercising such rights, such person should seek the advice of legal\ncounsel.\nStockholders or beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of\nMomentive common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nsuch person must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n84\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nsuch person must deliver to Momentive a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the\nmerger agreement at the special meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch person must continuously hold of record or beneficially own the shares of Momentive\ncommon stock from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a\nperson will lose appraisal rights if the person transfers the shares before the effective time of the\nmerger)\u037e and\n\u2022\nsuch person or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndemanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after\nthe effective time of the merger (the surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition\nand has no intention of doing so).\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to\ndetermine persons entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all persons who\nasserted appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock unless one of the\nownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement, each person who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain.\nFiling Written Demand\nA person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Momentive, before the vote on the adoption of\nthe merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person\u2019s shares. In\naddition, that person must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A\nvote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether\nby mail or via the internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the\nshares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A person exercising\nappraisal rights must hold or own, as applicable, beneficially or of record, the shares on the date the written\ndemand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold or own, as applicable, the shares through the\neffective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless\nrevoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the\nstockholder\u2019s and beneficial owner\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written\ndemand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or\nabstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the\nmerger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger\nagreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of\nSection 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on\nthe adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not\nconstitute a demand. A person\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the\nadoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nIn the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a stockholder of record, the demand must reasonably\ninform Momentive of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an\nappraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. In the case of a written demand for appraisal made by a beneficial\nowner, the demand must reasonably identify the record holder of the shares for which the demand is made,\nbe accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner\u2019s beneficial ownership of such stock\nand a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and\nprovide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the surviving\ncorporation and to be set forth on the verified list (as defined below).\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nMomentive Global Inc.\nOne Curiosity Way\nSan Mateo, California 94403\nAttention: Chief Legal Officer & Secretary\n85\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant to the merger agreement, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes, by delivering to Momentive, as the surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for appraisal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of\nChancery will be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and\nsuch approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just,\nincluding, without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction (which we refer to as a \u201creservation\u201d) for any\napplication (as defined below)\u037e provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any person who has\nnot commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such\nperson\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time\nof the merger. If the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding\nwith respect to a person, such person will be entitled to receive only the fair value determined in any such\nappraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share price being offered\npursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will\nnotify each stockholder (including any beneficial owner) of each constituent corporation who has properly\nmade a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption\nof the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective time thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any\nperson who has complied with Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262\nmay commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy\nserved on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by any person other than the surviving\ncorporation, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders\nentitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a\npetition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any\nnegotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Momentive common stock. Accordingly, any\npersons who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their\nappraisal rights in respect of their shares of Momentive common stock within the time and in the manner\nprescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could\nnullify a previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any person who has complied with the requirements\nfor an appraisal of such person\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to\nreceive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in\nfavor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Momentive has received demands\nfor appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares\n(provided that where a beneficial owner makes a demand for appraisal directly, the record holder of such\nshares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of this aggregate\nnumber). Such statement must be given within ten days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the\nwritten request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of\ndemands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by any person other than the surviving corporation, service of a copy\nthereof must be made upon the surviving corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such\nservice to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the \u201cverified\nlist\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and\nwith whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of\nChancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given to the\nsurviving corporation and all of the persons shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. The\ncosts of any such notice are borne by the surviving corporation.\n86\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAfter notice is provided to the applicable persons as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, at the\nhearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the persons who have complied with\nSection 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay require the persons who demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by stock\ncertificates to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any person fails to comply with this requirement, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. Upon application by the surviving\ncorporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\npersons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the verified list may participate fully in\nall proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section\n262.\nGiven that the shares common stock are listed on the Nasdaq (and assuming such shares remain so listed\nup until closing of the merger), the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to\nall holders of shares of Momentive common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one\nof the ownership thresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the persons entitled to appraisal and, with respect to\nMomentive common stock, that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect\nof persons seeking appraisal rights, then the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the\nrules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.\nThrough such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of\nMomentive common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair\nvalue. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,\ninterest from the effective time of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and\nthe date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to\neach person seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to\nsubsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (x) the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of\nthe shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (y) interest accrued before such voluntary\ncash payment, unless paid at that time.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In\nWeinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in\ndetermining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods\nwhich are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving\nthe value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value,\nthe court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the\nenterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on\nfuture prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does\nnot encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value\narising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also\nstated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible\nof proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nPersons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined\nby the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they\nwould receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nmerger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262.\nALTHOUGH MOMENTIVE BELIEVES THAT THE PER SHARE PRICE IS FAIR, NO REPRESENTATION IS\nMADE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THE APPRAISAL OF FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE\nDELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, AND STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT SUCH AN\nAPPRAISAL COULD RESULT IN A DETERMINATION OF A VALUE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN, OR THE\nSAME AS, THE PER SHARE PRICE. Neither Momentive nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per\nshare price to any persons exercising appraisal rights, and each of Momentive and Parent reserves the\nrights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any\nappraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Momentive common\nstock is less than the per share price. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed or, with respect to\nMomentive common stock, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of\npersons seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest,\nif any, by the surviving corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such\nperson upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court\nof Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Delaware Court of Chancery may be\nenforced.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of\nexperts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name\nappears on the verified list who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith\n(which we refer to as an \u201capplication\u201d), the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion\nof such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal that were not\ndismissed pursuant to the terms of Section 262 or subject to an award pursuant to a reservation. In the\nabsence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Momentive common stock under Section\n262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, such person\u2019s shares of\nMomentive common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the\nright to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement. A person will fail to perfect, or\neffectively lose, such person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the\neffective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of\nthose seeking appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock, or if the person\ndelivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and an\nacceptance of the per share price as provided in the merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no person who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance\nwith Section 262 will be entitled to vote such shares of Momentive common stock for any purpose or to\nreceive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions\npayable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective time of the merger)\u037e provided,\nhowever, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the\nownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of those seeking appraisal rights with respect to\nthe shares of Momentive common stock, or if such person delivers to the surviving corporation a written\nwithdrawal of such person\u2019s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, within 60 days after\nthe effective time of the merger, then the right of such person to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any person\nwithout the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court\ndeems just, including, without limitation, a reservation\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect\nthe right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the\nmerger within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.\n88\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of\nappraisal rights. In that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in\naccordance with the merger agreement, less any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any person\nwishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise\nthose rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that\nmay be relevant to U.S. holders and Non-U.S. holders of shares of Momentive common stock whose shares\nare converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), U.S. Treasury Regulations\npromulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\n(which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy\nstatement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThis discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Momentive common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, as property held for investment purposes). With\nrespect to holders whose shares of Momentive common stock were subject to vesting restrictions at the\ntime such shares were acquired, if any, this discussion assumes that a valid and timely election pursuant to\nSection 83(b) of the Code was made with respect to such shares.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences\nthat may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does\nnot address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of Momentive common stock in a\ncompensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of Momentive options, or Momentive RSUs,\nor otherwise in connection with the performance of services\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under\nU.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S\ncorporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-\nthrough entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in\nstocks and securities\u037e traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of\naccounting for their securities\u037e regulated investment companies\u037e real estate investment trusts\u037e\nentities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e holders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified\nsmall business stock\u201d for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code, as \u201cSection 1244\nstock\u201d within the meaning of Section 1244 of the Code, or through individual retirement or other tax-\ndeferred accounts\u037e Non-U.S. holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of\nMomentive common stock\u037e or U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of\nthe United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,\nstraddle, or other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or\nother entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of\ngross income with respect to the shares of Momentive common stock being taken into account in\nan \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nany U.S. federal estate, gift, or alternative or other minimum tax consequences\u037e\n89TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nany state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to persons that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand\nappraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common stock, then the tax\ntreatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Momentive common stock and\npartners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nthe merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given\nthat a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court. Further, no opinion of counsel has\nbeen or will be rendered with respect to the tax consequences of the merger or related transactions.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE\nLEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-\nINCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\nU.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common\nstock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\ncreated or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of\nColumbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e\nor\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the\ncontrol of one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2)\nhas a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United\nStates person.\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Momentive common stock pursuant to the\nmerger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. holder\u2019s\ngain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.\nholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax\nbasis in the shares surrendered in the merger generally will equal the amount that such U.S. holder paid for\nthose shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such\nU.S. holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the\nmerger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate\nU.S. holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder\nacquired different blocks of shares of Momentive common stock at different times and/or different prices,\nsuch holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block\nof Momentive common stock.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nGeneral\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of Momentive common\nstock that is neither a U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n90\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTaxable Sale of Company Capital Stock\nSubject to the discussion below on backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below) withholding, any gain\nrealized by a Non-U.S. holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax\nunless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. holder in the United\nStates (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent\nestablishment maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the United States), in which case such gain\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons,\nand, if the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits\ntax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in\nthe taxable year of the completion of the merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in\nwhich case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower\nrate under an applicable income tax treaty) and such person will generally be required to file a U.S.\nfederal income tax return\u037e or\n\u2022\nMomentive is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is\ndefined in Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer to as a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the\nshorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. holder\u2019s holding period with\nrespect to the applicable shares of Momentive common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant\nperiod\u201d) and, if shares of Momentive common stock are regularly traded on an established\nsecurities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. holder\nowns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of Momentive common stock at\nany time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income\ntax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),\nexcept that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair\nmarket value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50\npercent of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other\nassets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property interests\ngenerally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no\nassurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time\nduring the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their\ntax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds\nreceived by a holder pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. holder\nthat furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S. holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or an appropriate substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S.\nholder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of\nIRS Form W-8 (or an appropriate substitute or successor form)\u037e or (b) otherwise appropriately establishes an\nexemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld\nunder the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder\u2019s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, if the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S.\nfederal income tax return, for the taxable year that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain\nfacts relating to the merger.\nAdditional Withholding Requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance\nissued thereunder (which we refer to as, collectively, \u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30\npercent on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under these rules)\nunless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain\n91\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\npayments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain\nU.S. account holders of such institution (which include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as\nwell as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA\nalso generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-\nfinancial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a certification identifying certain\ndirect and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement\nbetween the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain\ncircumstances, a Non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form,\nwould eliminate the FATCA withholding applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of\nMomentive common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department\nstated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nHolders of Momentive common stock are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the\npossible implications of FATCA on the disposition of Momentive common stock pursuant to the merger.\nTHE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE INCLUDED\nFOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE BASED UPON CURRENT LAW.\nBECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DIFFER, EACH U.S. HOLDER AND NON-U.S. HOLDER\nSHOULD CONSULT SUCH HOLDER\u2019S TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE\nRULES DISCUSSED ABOVE TO SUCH HOLDER AND THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE\nMERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE,\nLOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and\nnotwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action\nunder its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Momentive or Parent.

Momentive\u2019s stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement\nand should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements or any descriptions\nthereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Momentive, Parent, or Merger Sub or\nany of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the\nrepresentations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. Except where expressly\nprovided in the merger agreement, none of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the\nmerger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of\nthe merger. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations\non the respective businesses of Momentive, Parent, and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain\nactions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as\notherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the\npublic. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with\ninformation regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information\nregarding Momentive, Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,\nwarranties, covenants, and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you\nshould read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in Momentive\u2019s filings with the SEC\nregarding Momentive and Momentive\u2019s business.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed by Parent, Merger Sub, and Momentive\nthat is no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the\nmerger agreement) of the last condition to the closing of the merger (other than those conditions that by\ntheir term are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the\nextent permitted under the merger agreement) of such conditions)\u037e or (2) at such other time agreed to by\nMomentive, Parent, and Merger Sub in writing. On the closing date of the merger, the parties will cause the\nmerger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of\nthat certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at a later time agreed to in\nwriting by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL.",

The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the\neffective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior\nto the effective time of the Merger (such shares, collectively, \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d or \u201cShares\u201d and each, a\n\u201cShare\u201d), other than (i) each Share to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii) of the Merger\nAgreement and (ii) Dissenting Company Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), shall be\nconverted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $9.46 in cash, without interest (the\n\u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), subject to any required Tax (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) withholding\nas provided in the Merger Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger\nAgreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in\naccordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other\nthan Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March\n13, 2023 (the \u201cDraft Merger Agreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial\nstatements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-\nlooking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial\nprojections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d). Additionally, we discussed the past\nand current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the\nCompany.
