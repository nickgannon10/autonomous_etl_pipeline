        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nThe following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the special\nmeeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in\nthis proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions in\nthe section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\nA:\nOn March 25, 2022, we entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, HP will acquire Poly for $40.00 in cash per share of our\ncommon stock. In order to complete the merger, our stockholders representing a majority of all issued and outstanding common stock must vote to\nadopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. This approval is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.\u201d The Poly Board is furnishing this proxy statement and\nform of proxy card to the holders of shares of our common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of our stockholders to be voted at the\nspecial meeting.\nThis proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, the special meeting\nand the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock\nwithout attending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares of our common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.\nYour vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Poly?\nA:\nThe proposed merger is the acquisition of Poly by HP. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by our stockholders and the other\nclosing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Poly, with Poly continuing as the\nsurviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Poly will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HP, and our common stock will no longer be\npublicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no\nlonger file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $40.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each\nshare of our common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal\nrights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you\nwill receive $4,000.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nHow does the per share price compare to the market price of Poly\u2019s common stock?\nA:\nThis amount constitutes (1) a premium of approximately 47 percent to the closing price of our common stock on March 24, 2022\u037e and (2) a premium\nof approximately 47 percent to Poly\u2019s 30-trading day average closing stock price ending on March 24, 2022.\n16Table of Contents\nQ:\nWhat will happen to Poly equity-based awards?\nA:\nGenerally speaking, at or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Poly equity-based awards that are outstanding immediately prior to\nthe effective time of the merger will be treated as follows:\n\u2022\nEach share of Poly Restricted Stock will vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the per share price under the same terms and\nconditions as apply to the receipt of the merger consideration by holders of our common stock generally.\n\u2022\nOutstanding Poly RSUs will be canceled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of our\ncommon stock subject to such Poly RSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by (B) the per share price. This\namount (less any required withholding and other taxes) will be paid to the applicable holder at or reasonably promptly after the effective time\nof the merger.\n\u2022\nOutstanding Poly PSUs will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the total number of shares of\nour common stock subject to such Poly PSUs immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (calculated based on the terms of the Poly\nequity plan and applicable award agreement governing such Poly PSUs and based on actual performance against performance targets with\nsuch performance determined as of five business days prior to the effective time of the merger) multiplied by (B) the per share price.

For example, if you hold your shares in more than\none brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a\nstockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting\nmaterials that you receive.\n23\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nIf available, Poly may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Poly intends to publish final voting results in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Poly files with the SEC are publicly available\nwhen filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nQ:\nWill I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?\nA:\nIf you are a U.S. Holder, the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of\nour common stock surrendered in the merger.\nA Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of\nthe Merger\u201d) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger\nunless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding unless the Non-U.S. Holder\ncomplies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding.\nBecause particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax\nlaws or the laws of any territory, state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. This discussion is provided for general information only and does not\nconstitute legal advice to any holder. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the\nsection of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nWe currently expect to complete the merger by the end of 2022. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted\nbecause the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.\nQ:\nWhat governmental and regulatory approvals are required?\nA:\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act has\nexpired or been terminated. Additionally, under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until all consents, approvals and\nfilings required under the specified foreign regulatory laws have been obtained or made.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?\nA:\nIf the merger is consummated and certain conditions set forth in Section 262(g) of the DGCL are satisfied, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in\nfavor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) continuously hold their applicable shares of our common stock through the effective time of the\nmerger, (3) properly demand appraisal of their shares, (4) meet certain statutory requirements as described in this proxy statement and (5) do not\nwithdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal, will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of\nChancery and\n24\nTable of Contents\nto receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of\nthe merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the\namount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the\njudgment at a rate of five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the\nperiod between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment, compounded quarterly (except that, if at any time before\nthe entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal, interest\nwill accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to\nmake such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek\nthe advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements\nfor exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Appraisal Rights\u201d,\nwhich description is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.\nQ:\nDo any of Poly\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Poly stockholders generally?\nA:\nYes. In considering the recommendation of the Poly Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that\nour directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders\ngenerally. In: (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement\u037e (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger\u037e and (3) recommending that\nthe merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Poly Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at\nthe time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of Poly\u2019s Directors\nand Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWho can help answer my questions?\nA:\nIf you have any questions concerning the merger, the special meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of the accompanying\nproxy statement or need help submitting your proxy or voting your shares of our common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:\nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, New York 10022\nStockholders call toll-free: (877) 456-3427\nBanks and brokers call collect: (212) 750-5833\n25\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. This chronology does not\npurport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Poly Board, the Strategic Committee (as defined below), our representatives, or other parties.\nThe Poly Board regularly evaluates our strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening our business and\nenhancing stockholder value, including in the light of the opportunities and challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, work-from-home trends,\nsupply chain disruptions, the impact of market, customer and competitive trends and other economic and industry conditions affecting Poly. As part of\nthis evaluation, the Poly Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the\ncontinuation of, and potential improvements to, our current business plan, with Poly remaining an independent entity\u037e (2) the investment in, and\ndevelopment of, new products and services, and expansion into new markets\u037e (3) capital raising activities\u037e (4) potential expansion opportunities through\nacquisitions, partnerships or other commercial relationships\u037e and (5) business combinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the\nsale of Poly.\nAs active participants in the connectivity and peripherals space, HP and Poly are well known to each other. From time to time, members of Poly\nmanagement have met with members of HP management to discuss, in general terms, their industry and their respective companies, as well as ways that\nthe two companies could work together, including through product partnerships and product offerings.\nIn January 2021, Dave Shull, our president and chief executive officer, met with senior executives of HP, including Alex Cho, the president of HP\u2019s\nPersonal Systems Group, to discuss industry dynamics, their respective companies, potential commercial and strategic partnerships, and other ways that\nPoly and HP could work together.\nOn March 30, 2021, we entered into a confidentiality agreement with HP to discuss ways that Poly and HP could work together. This confidentiality\nagreement did not include a \u201cstandstill\u201d or other restriction on HP\u2019s ability to make public or private proposals to acquire us.\nIn April 2021 and May 2021, members of Poly management and HP management met to discuss industry dynamics, their respective companies,\npotential strategic partnerships and other ways that Poly and HP could work together. An acquisition of Poly by HP was one of many types of\ntransactions discussed. These discussions were preliminary and hypothetical in nature, and specific terms of an acquisition were not discussed.\n36Table of Contents\nThereafter, Mr. Shull and senior executives of HP had intermittent conversations about industry dynamics and their respective companies. From\ntime to time, Mr. Shull updated the Poly Board on the nature of these discussions.\nOn November 15, 2021, Messrs. Shull and Cho met to discuss, in general terms, potential transactions between Poly and HP that could strengthen\nboth companies, including the possibility of a broader commercial relationship coupled with a strategic investment by HP in Poly.\nOn November 17, 2021, Mr. Cho spoke with Mr. Shull. During this conversation, Mr. Cho noted that HP had thought further about potential\npartnerships and transactions with Poly and determined that HP preferred to acquire Poly, and that HP would be sending a letter to that effect. Mr. Shull\nsaid that he would discuss the matter with the Poly Board.\nLater, on November 17, 2021, HP submitted a non-binding written proposal to acquire Poly for $40.00 in cash per share of our common stock. We\nrefer to this as the \u201cInitial HP Proposal.\u201d Mr. Shull subsequently shared the Initial HP Proposal with the Poly Board.\nOn November 19, 2021, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,\nProfessional Corporation (which we refer to as \u201cWilson Sonsini\u201d), our outside legal counsel, in attendance. Mr. Shull reviewed for the Poly Board the\nnature of his prior discussions with HP and the terms of the Initial HP Proposal. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the\nPoly Board their fiduciary duties. It was the consensus of the Poly Board that the Initial HP Proposal had the potential to lead to a transaction that would\nbe attractive to Poly and our stockholders, and that it was appropriate to have additional discussions with HP. As such, the Poly Board instructed Mr.\nShull to inform HP that the Poly Board was considering the Initial HP Proposal. To provide assistance to, and oversight of, Poly management in its\ndiscussions with HP, as well as in view of the possibility that the Poly Board could elect to undertake a broader review of strategic alternatives in\nconnection with discussions with HP, the Poly Board established a strategic committee (which we refer to as the \u201cStrategic Committee\u201d). The Strategic\nCommittee was formed in the light of the benefits, convenience and efficiency of having a subset of directors oversee any process of considering\nstrategic alternatives in the context of (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in any decision by Poly to evaluate strategic\nalternatives\u037e and (2) the possibility that Poly management and our advisers would need feedback and direction on relatively short notice. The Strategic\nCommittee was not formed due to any actual or perceived conflict of any director or officer of Poly. The Poly Board authorized and instructed the\nStrategic Committee to, among other things, (1) oversee and provide assistance to Poly management and our advisers\u037e (2) explore, evaluate, consider,\nreview and negotiate the terms and conditions of any strategic alternative, including any sale of Poly\u037e (3) take such other actions with respect to any\nstrategic alternative as the Strategic Committee deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable\u037e and (4) recommend what action, if any, that the Poly Board\nshould take with respect to any strategic alternative. The Poly Board retained the power and authority to approve the final decision on pursuing a\nstrategic alternative, including a sale of Poly. It was also understood that the Poly Board would continue to have an active role in the consideration of\nstrategic alternatives, and that the Strategic Committee would update and seek input from the Poly Board as appropriate. The Poly Board appointed Brian\nDexheimer, Robert C. Hagerty, Marshall Mohr and Marvin Tseu as the members of the Strategic Committee. These individuals were selected because of,\namong other things, their substantial familiarity with Poly and its business and their experience in similar circumstances. Mr. Hagerty was subsequently\ndesignated as the chairperson of the Strategic Committee. The Poly Board did not provide for the payment of any compensation to the members of the\nStrategic Committee in consideration of their service on the committee (other than their ordinary course compensation as members of the Poly Board).\nThe Poly Board discussed the retention of a financial adviser to assist us in connection with evaluating a transaction with HP, as well as with any broader\nreview of strategic alternatives. The Poly Board identified Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser who could provide such assistance. Morgan Stanley is\nwell known to the Poly Board given Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, extensive expertise, international reputation, knowledge of the industry in which\nPoly operates and experience in advising similar companies in connection with potential\n37\nTable of Contents\nstrategic transactions. The Poly Board authorized the Strategic Committee to (1) assess Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications and independence to serve as\nour financial adviser\u037e and (2) work with Poly management to determine if Morgan Stanley was available to assist us. Morgan Stanley was subsequently\ncontacted, and it was determined that they could provide assistance to us.\nOn November 24, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan Stanley in attendance. The\nrepresentatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed the Initial HP Proposal from a financial point of view. The Strategic Committee reviewed ways to potentially\nimprove that proposal for the benefit of our stockholders.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan\nStanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed potential responses to the Initial HP Proposal. The Strategic Committee\ndetermined to recommend to the Poly Board that it reject the Initial HP Proposal but signal a willingness to assist HP in better understanding our long-\nterm business plans (including by providing due diligence information) so that HP could improve the value of its acquisition proposal. The Strategic\nCommittee discussed the possibility of contacting other parties regarding their interest in acquiring Poly. It was noted that such contact had the risk of\ncreating opportunities for public speculation that we were pursuing a sale, and that such speculation could be harmful to us and our employees and\nbusiness partners. The Strategic Committee determined not to initiate such contact at that time due to the potential impact of these risks to us, our\nemployees and our business partners. After the departure of the representatives of Morgan Stanley from the meeting, the Strategic Committee (1)\ndiscussed Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications and independence in connection with serving as our financial adviser\u037e and (2) determined to recommend that\nthe Poly Board engage Morgan Stanley.\nOn November 30, 2021, the Poly Board met, with members of Poly management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The members\nof the Strategic Committee noted that they were supportive of engaging Morgan Stanley as our financial adviser. The Poly Board discussed Morgan\nStanley\u2019s qualifications and independence in connection with serving as our financial adviser, including earlier discussions with the Strategic Committee\nduring which representatives of Morgan Stanley generally described Morgan Stanley\u2019s historical relationships with HP and its affiliates. Following the\ndiscussion, the Poly Board approved the engagement of Morgan Stanley as our financial adviser and instructed the Strategic Committee to negotiate and\nenter into an appropriate engagement letter with Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley joined the meeting and reviewed the Initial HP\nProposal from a financial point of view and discussed with the Poly Board potential responses. The members of the Strategic Committee provided their\nrecommendation that the Poly Board reject the Initial HP Proposal but signal a willingness to assist HP in better understanding our long-term business\nplans (including by providing due diligence information) so that HP could improve the value of its acquisition proposal. It was the consensus of the Poly\nBoard to accept the recommendation of the Strategic Committee.\nOn December 1, 2021, at the direction of the Poly Board, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Poly management spoke with representatives of\neach of HP and HP\u2019s financial advisers, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (which were refer to as \u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d) and Foros Securities LLC (which we refer to\nas \u201cForos\u201d), regarding the Poly Board\u2019s determination. The representatives of HP expressed a willingness to undertake a due diligence review of our\nbusiness and long-term plans.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Strategic Committee met, with members of Poly management and representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Morgan\nStanley in attendance. The representatives of Morgan Stanley and members of Poly management discussed their conversation on December 1, 2021, with\nrepresentatives of each of HP, Goldman Sachs and Foros. The members of Poly management reviewed with the Strategic Committee a draft of Poly\u2019s\ncurrent long-term business plan and described, among other things, Poly management\u2019s process for preparing Poly\u2019s long-term business plan, including\nthe underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to realizing the forecasted results. As part of this discussion, the members of Poly\nthe underlying assumptions and various execution and other risks to realizing the forecasted results. As part of this discussion, the members of Poly\nmanagement described the Credit Case, which was initially prepared for the information of the lender under Poly\u2019s revolving credit facility. As described\nin the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201c\u2014Prospective Unaudited Financial\n38\nTable of Contents\nInformation,\u201d the Credit Case assumed (1) the continuation of supply constraints for fiscal year 2023 impacting revenue\u037e (2) growth rates in fiscal year\n2024 and fiscal year 2025 that were consistent with industry analyst market growth rate assumptions\u037e and (3) a negative impact to gross margin and\noperating margin in fiscal year 2023 due to higher component and freight costs consistent with those experienced in fiscal year 2022, and improvements to\ngross margin and operating margin thereafter as supply constraints and freight costs normalize. The members of Poly management also described the\nField Case, which was characterized as reflecting a more optimistic, but potentially achievable, forecast than the Credit Case.

at levels specified in the merger agreement for a period of 12\nmonths following the closing (or shorter period of employment). Such continued compensation and benefits will apply to all continuing employees\ngenerally and are not specific to executive officers.

This compensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the\napplicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the merger-related compensation payable to Poly\u2019s named executive\nofficers. Poly\u2019s \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Shull, Hagerty, Boynton, Wiese and Puorro\nand Mses. Bodensteiner and Huser.

Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth\nbelow. Poly\u2019s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation or tax reimbursements in connection with the\nmerger.

        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights\nGeneral Information\nIf the merger is consummated, our stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) properly demand an\nappraisal of their applicable shares of our common stock prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement, (3) continuously hold their shares\nthrough the effective time of the merger, (4) otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as \u201cSection 262\u201d),\nincluding by satisfying certain ownership thresholds set forth therein, and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal\nmay, subject to the conditions of Section 262, seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262. Unless the context requires\notherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d or to a \u201cholder of shares\u201d are to a record holder of our common stock.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the\nfull text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following\nsummary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights\nunder Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\nperson having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee,\nmust act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares. If you hold your shares of our common\n71Table of Contents\nstock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other\nnominee to ensure that appraisal rights are exercised. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 as well as the information\ndiscussed below.\nUnder Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of our common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of\nsuch stockholder\u2019s shares to Poly prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement\u037e (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger\nagreement\u037e and (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger may be entitled to have their shares of our\ncommon stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of our common stock,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in\nits discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the\neffective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment. However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of\nChancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted\nappraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our\ncommon stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares\nexceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the \u201cownership thresholds.\u201d Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the\ndate the judgment is paid at five percent over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such\nperiod (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving\ncorporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days\nprior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and\ninclude in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Poly\u2019s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in\nconnection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the merger, any holder of\nshares of our common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex C\ncarefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the\nDGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per share price described in the merger agreement without\ninterest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of our\ncommon stock, Poly believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Poly a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a\nstockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger).\n72\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal\nrights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, each of\nour stockholders who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain with\nrespect to such proposal.\nFiling Written Demand\nA stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Poly, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special\nmeeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. In addition, that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the\nadoption of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, in person at the special meeting or by proxy (whether by mail\nor via the Internet or telephone), will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written\ndemands for appraisal. A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and\nmust continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger. Neither voting (in person or by proxy) against the adoption of the\nmerger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written\ndemand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or\nvote on the adoption of the merger agreement.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\ndemand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform\nPoly of the identity of the holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. If the shares are owned\nof record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the\nrecord owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for\nappraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the\ndemand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If a stockholder holds shares of our common stock through a broker who in turn\nholds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on\nbehalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN \u201cSTREET NAME\u201d BY A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH\nTO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL\nOF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH\nAS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN\nA TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:\nPlantronics, Inc.\n345 Encinal Street\nSanta Cruz, California 95060\nAttention: Corporate Secretary\n73\nTable of Contents\nAt any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the per share price offered pursuant\nto the merger agreement, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, by delivering to Poly, as the surviving corporation, a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger\nwill require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will\nbe dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that this will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration\nwithin 60 days after the effective time of the merger. If Poly, as the surviving corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal\nwhen that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder\u2019s demand in accordance with the proviso in\nthe immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a\nstockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less\nthan, equal to or more than the per share price being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each record holder of shares of\nour common stock who has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the\nmerger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of our common stock\nwho has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or a beneficial owner in the circumstances described in the next\nparagraph) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving\ncorporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders\nentitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not\nassume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their\nappraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. If no petition for appraisal is\nfiled with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, stockholders\u2019 rights to appraisal shall cease, and all\nholders of shares of our common stock will be entitled to receive the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest.\nWithin 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied with the requirements for an\nappraisal of such holder\u2019s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement\nsetting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Poly has received\ndemands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must send this statement to the requesting\nstockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of\nthe period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a\nnominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the\nforegoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\n74\nTable of Contents\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation,\nthe surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be given\nto the surviving corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be given by\none or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,\nDelaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the surviving\ncorporation.\nAfter notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the\nstockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may\nrequire the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the\npendency of the appraisal proceedings. If any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the\nproceedings as to such stockholder.\nPursuant to Section 262(g) of the DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all of our stockholders who assert\nappraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as\nmeasured in accordance with Section 262(g) of the DGCL or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the \u201cfair\nvalue\u201d of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into\naccount all relevant factors. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\neffective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent over the Federal\nReserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date\nof payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s entry of judgment in\nthe proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment\npursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the\nsurviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\u037e and (2) interest\naccrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors\nthat could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are\ngenerally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously\nrequires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of\nfair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be\nascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be\n\u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware\nSupreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies\n75\nTable of Contents\nonly to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that\n\u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product\nof speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares\nand that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an\nopinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value\nas determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value\nhigher or lower than, or the same as, the per share price. Neither Poly nor HP anticipates offering more than the per share price to any stockholder\nexercising appraisal rights, and each of Poly and HP reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and\nto assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of our common stock is less than the per share price.\nThe costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a\nstockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the\nappraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value\nof all the shares entitled to an appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly\nwithdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of our common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of\nthe merger into the right to receive the per share price as provided in the merger agreement.\nFrom and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 will be entitled to\nvote such shares of our common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger).\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights. In\nthat event, you will be entitled to receive the per share price for your dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and\nless any applicable withholding taxes. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before\nattempting to exercise those rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and\nNon-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the\nmerger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the\nCode, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other applicable authorities, all as in\neffect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to\n76Table of Contents\nchange or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to beneficial owners who hold their shares of our common\nstock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to beneficial owners in light\nof their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:\n\u2022\ntax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as\nfinancial institutions\u037e tax-exempt organizations\u037e S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or\npass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes\u037e insurance companies\u037e mutual funds\u037e dealers in stocks and securities\u037e traders in\nsecurities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities\u037e regulated investment companies\u037e real estate\ninvestment trusts\u037e entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules\u037e holders who hold their common stock as \u201cqualified small business stock\u201d\nfor purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code\u037e Non-U.S. Holders that own (directly or by attribution) more than five percent of our\ncommon stock\u037e or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction\ntransaction\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of\noptions or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to U.S. Holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,\norganized or resident outside the United States\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income\u037e\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of our\ncommon stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d (as defined in the Code)\u037e\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any\u037e\n\u2022\nany territorial, state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences\u037e or\n\u2022\ntax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the\npartner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners therein should consult their\ntax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.\nNo ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described below. If the IRS\ncontests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY\nHOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\nRELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-\nINCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY TERRITORY, STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.\n77\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons\nas defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a\nUnited States person.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and\nthe U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount\nthat such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s\nholding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to\nlong-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses may be subject to limitations. If a U.S.\nHolder acquired different blocks of shares of our common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis\nand holding period separately with respect to each block of our common stock in accordance with such U.S. Holder\u2019s ordinary method of accounting.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder\nnor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such\ngain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a\ncorporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax\ntreaty)\u037e\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the completion of the\nmerger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30\npercent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nPoly is or has been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (which we refer\nto as \u201cUSRPHC\u201d), at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with\nrespect to the applicable shares of our common stock (which we refer to as the \u201crelevant period\u201d) and, if shares of our common stock are\nregularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns\n(directly, indirectly or constructively) more than five percent of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such\ngain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as\n78\nTable of Contents\ndescribed in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair\nmarket value of its U.S. real property interests (as defined in the Code) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market value of its\nworldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, U.S. real property\ninterests generally include land, improvements and associated personal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we\nbelieve that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger. Non-U.S. Holders are\nencouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24 percent) may apply to the proceeds received by a beneficial owner of our\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification\nnumber and certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form)\u037e or (2) a Non-U.S.\nHolder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor\nform)\u037e or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the\nbackup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if the required information is timely\nfurnished to the IRS.\nA U.S. Holder may be required to retain records related to such holder\u2019s common stock and file with its U.S. federal income tax return, for the taxable\nyear that includes the merger, a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued thereunder (which we refer to as\n\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially defined under\nthese rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the\nU.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of\nsuch institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also generally will impose a\nU.S. federal withholding tax of 30 percent on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent a\ncertification identifying certain direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the United\nStates and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder might be eligible for refunds or\ncredits of such taxes.\nThe Treasury Department has released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of\n30 percent applicable to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the U.S.\nTreasury Department stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nBeneficial owners of our common stock are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the\ndisposition of our common stock pursuant to the merger.",

If either\nagency issues a Second Request, the waiting period is extended until 30 days after the parties substantially comply with the request. The parties filed a\nnotification and report form with the FTC and DOJ on April 7, 2022. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration\nof a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting\nperiod. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 9, 2022.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the\nDOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and\ncontractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,\nany state or the District of Columbia\n80\nTable of Contents\ncould take such action under its antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the\nmerger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Poly or HP. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances.\nForeign Competition Laws and Foreign Investment Laws\nUnder the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until all consents, approvals and filings required under the specified foreign\nregulatory laws (which includes certain foreign antitrust laws and Articles L. 151-3 to L. 151-7 and R. 151-1 to R. 151-17 of the French Monetary and\nFinancial Code (which we refer to as the \u201cFrench FDI Law\u201d)) have been obtained or deemed to have been obtained. The parties must observe mandatory\nwaiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearances or consents in each of the following required foreign jurisdictions as promptly as\npracticable before completing the merger:\nChina. Under the Antimonopoly Law of 2007, transactions involving parties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until\nthey are reviewed and approved by the State Administration for Market Regulation (which we refer to as \u201cSAMR\u201d). HP and Poly have sufficient revenues\nto exceed SAMR\u2019s statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the merger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR approval. HP and Poly submitted a\nsimplified notification form to SAMR on April 8, 2022. The filing was formally accepted by SAMR under the simplified procedure on May 9, 2022, upon\nwhich date a 30-day Phase I review period commenced.\nEuropean Union. Both HP and Poly conduct business across the European Union in multiple member states. Under the Council Regulation (EC)\nNo. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (which we refer to as the \u201cEU Merger Regulation\u201d) the\nmerger cannot be completed until the merger is notified to the European Commission. The parties must wait to implement the merger until after the\nEuropean Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger compatible with the common market (and/or if the European Commission has referred\nany aspect of the merger to one or more competent authorities of a European Union member state under Article 9 of the EU Merger Regulation or an\nEFTA state under Article 6 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement, until each competent authority has issued a clearance or a confirmation that the merger\nmay proceed). As is customary, HP and Poly are in prenotification consultations with the European Commission and intend to file formally as soon as is\nreasonably practicable.\nFrance. Poly has a French subsidiary and conducts business activities in France through an indirectly wholly owned branch. Through its Dutch\nentity, Poly sells indirectly, via independent distributors and resellers and directly to certain large customers, certain Poly products and provides\nmaintenance and cloud services to customers who may be involved in sensitive or strategic activities in France. Under the French FDI Law, the\nacquisition of control over a French company by a foreign investor where the company\u2019s activities in France are deemed sensitive requires prior\nauthorization from the French Minister of Economy. Non-compliance with the French FDI Law can trigger significant sanctions, including the blocking or\nauthorization from the French Minister of Economy. Non-compliance with the French FDI Law can trigger significant sanctions, including the blocking or\nreversal of the proposed transaction in France and large fines. While there are reasonable arguments that Poly\u2019s activities do not constitute sensitive\nactivities under the French FDI Law, HP and Poly view it as advisable to proceed with a foreign investment filing in France to either obtain (1)\nconfirmation from the French authorities that Poly\u2019s French activities are out of scope\u037e or (2) prior approval from the French Minister of Economy should\nthe French authorities consider that the transaction is within the scope of the French FDI Law. HP and Poly therefore intend to submit a filing to the\nFrench Minister of Economy as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nColombia. In Colombia under Law 1340 of 2009, transactions involving parties with combined sales or assets above certain revenue levels cannot\nbe completed until they are reviewed and approved by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (which we refer to as \u201cSIC\u201d). HP and Poly intend\nto submit a notice to SIC as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nMexico. In Mexico under the Federal Law on Economic Competition of 2014, transactions involving parties with assets located in Mexico or annual\nvolumes of sales originating in Mexico, which jointly or separately\n81\nTable of Contents\nexceed certain thresholds, cannot be completed until they are reviewed and approved by the Federal Commission on Economic Competition (which we\nrefer to as \u201cCOFECE\u201d). HP and Poly intend to submit a notification to COFECE as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nThe merger agreement also specifies that the parties may make additional filings that, in the view of HP after consultation and discussion with, and\nconsideration in good faith of the views of, Poly, are required or advisable pursuant to any other foreign regulatory law (which include foreign antitrust\nand FDI laws), though obtaining consents or approvals in connection with these additional filings is not, and does not become, a set of closing\nconditions for the merger.\nIn any of these foreign jurisdictions, the relevant competition and FDI reviewing authorities could take such actions under applicable competition\nlaws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold\nseparate, assets or to terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions\ncould jeopardize or delay the completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of the merger. There is no assurance that HP and Poly will obtain all required\nregulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain the necessary clearances in any of these jurisdictions could substantially\ndelay or prevent the consummation of the merger, which could negatively impact both HP and Poly.\nPoly and HP have each agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to provide any reasonably necessary information in connection with\nany presentations, memoranda, briefs or other submissions made or provided to any governmental authority by or on behalf of any party hereto in\nconnection with proceedings or regulatory reviews under or relating to the HSR Act or any other antitrust law or foreign regulatory law (which includes\nboth foreign antitrust laws and FDI laws) related to the merger.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary\napprovals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory\napprovals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how\nlong it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial\nperiod of time between the approval by our stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances\nand approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of\nadditional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result\nin the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.",

        "Section Text": "THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to carefully read and consider the\nmerger agreement, which is the legal document that governs the merger, in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about\nthe merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement,\nand not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for\npurposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement\u037e (3) may be\nsubject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Poly, HP and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating\nthe terms of the merger agreement\u037e and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to\nreports and documents filed with the SEC and from those applicable to investors, and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to\nHP and Merger Sub by Poly in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the\nmerger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Poly and HP and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts.\nFurther, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the\nmerger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a\nchange in circumstance or otherwise. Our stockholders are not generally third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on\nthe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of\nPoly, HP or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations\nand warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger,\nand, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time of the merger. In addition, you should not rely on the\ncovenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Poly, HP and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain\nactions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate\nparty, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to\nprovide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Poly, HP, Merger\nSub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not\nbe read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Poly and our\nbusiness. Please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date that is as soon as possible, but no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or\nwaiver of all of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions\u037e or (2) at such other time as agreed to in writing by Poly and HP. On the closing date of\nthe merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will\nbecome effective upon the filing of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as may be agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate\nof merger.\n87Table of Contents",

an\nintervening event or (2) a superior proposal\u037e or terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal in order to enter into a definitive\nagreement providing for such superior
