        "Section Text": "Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement\nConcurrent with the initial public offering of the Class A Common Stock and related reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with\nsuch initial public offering, McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their affiliates entered into a tax receivable agreement dated as of October 21, 2020 (the\n\u201cTRA\u201d) with (1) certain members of OpCo LLC who retained OpCo LLC units after McAfee\u2019s initial public offering and (2) certain of the affiliates of such\nmembers. The TRA provides for payment by McAfee to such members and certain of their\n \n14Table of Contents\naffiliates (collectively, the \u201cTRA beneficiaries\u201d) of 85% of the benefits, if any, that McAfee is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a\nresult of (i) all or a portion of McAfee\u2019s allocable share of existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) acquired in connection with\nthe reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with McAfee\u2019s initial public offering, (ii) increases in McAfee\u2019s allocable share of existing tax\nbasis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) and tax basis adjustments in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) as a result of sales or\nexchanges of OpCo LLC units after McAfee\u2019s initial public offering, (iii) certain tax attributes of the corporations McAfee acquired in connection with\nsuch reorganization transactions (including their allocable share of existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries)), and (iv) certain\nother tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in McAfee\u2019s allocable\nshare of existing tax basis in OpCo LLC assets and tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and\namortization deductions available to members of OpCo LLC and, therefore, may reduce the amount of tax that McAfee would otherwise be required to pay\nin the future in respect of taxable income and gain allocated to McAfee with respect to OpCo LLC units.\nConcurrent with the entry into the TRA on October 21, 2020, the limited liability company operating agreement of OpCo LLC was amended and\nrestated to be in the form of the OpCo LLC Agreement. The OpCo LLC Agreement contemplates, among other things, the quarterly distribution of cash to\nthe members of OpCo LLC (which entity is intended to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) intended to be sufficient to\ncover such members\u2019 respective U.S. federal, state and local income tax liability (as determined in accordance with the OpCo LLC Agreement). Such tax\nliability relates to the net amount of taxable income and gain allocated to such members for the relevant taxable period (or as a result of any capital shifts\nor guaranteed payments for the use of capital) with respect to OpCo LLC units held by such members. These tax distributions result in the outflow of\ncash from OpCo LLC to members of the OpCo LLC each quarter.\nOn November 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee and OpCo LLC and certain of their affiliates entered into\nan amendment to the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) with TPG Global, LLC and Intel Americas, Inc. (in their capacities as the\n\u201cTPG Nominee\u201d and the \u201cIntel Nominee\u201d respectively as such terms are defined under the TRA) and certain other TRA beneficiaries and members of\nOpCo LLC, in accordance with the terms of the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement. A copy of the Amendment is attached as Annex C to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Amendment (i) amends the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement (as further described below) and (ii) provides for certain covenants regarding\ntax reporting and tax-related actions after the closing of the Merger.\nThe Amendment provides for (i) the payment of amounts due under the TRA with respect to McAfee\u2019s 2020 U.S. federal income tax year in\naccordance with the terms of the TRA up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000, which payments shall be paid no later than 10 business days prior to the\nClosing Date, (ii) the suspension of all other payments under the TRA from and after November 5, 2021 and (iii) the amendment of the TRA by inserting a\nnew Section 7.19 into the TRA effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time which will result in the TRA\n(and all of McAfee\u2019s future obligations thereunder, including the obligation to make any of the foregoing suspended payments) terminating immediately\nprior to the Effective Time. The Amendment also includes agreements among the parties thereto regarding the preparation of tax returns for tax periods\nthat end on, before or include the Closing Date and limits actions that may be taken by McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their controlled affiliates after\nthe closing of the Merger to the extent such actions may have an effect on items reflected on such tax returns.\nThe Amendment also (i) suspends all tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement from and after November 5, 2021 for so long as the\nAmendment is in effect, and (ii) provides that from and after the Effective Time, no person or entity shall have any obligation to make or pay tax\ndistributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement.\n \n15\nTable of Contents\nIn the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Amendment shall become null and void ab initio and all\npayments that were suspended under the TRA pursuant to the Amendment, and all tax distributions that were suspended under the OpCo LLC\nAgreement pursuant to the Amendment, shall be made by McAfee and OpCo LLC as if the Amendment had never been executed.\nThe Amendment will result in (i) the suspension of certain in payments under the TRA with respect to McAfee\u2019s 2021 U.S. federal income tax year\nin aggregate and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement, a permanent elimination of certain payments\nunder the TRA that would have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA with respect to McAfee\u2019s 2021 U.S. federal income tax\nyear. The Amendment will also eliminate any obligation of McAfee to make a payment under the TRA as a result of a change of control of McAfee, which\nwould be substantial. The Amendment also will result in (i) the suspension of certain tax distributions by OpCo LLC under the OpCo LLC Agreement with\nrespect to McAfee\u2019s 2021 and 2022 U.S. federal income tax years and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger\nAgreement, a permanent elimination of an obligation to make such tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement.\nFor more information with respect to the Amendment, please see our other filings with the SEC, including the section in our 2021 Proxy Statement\ncaptioned \u201cAmendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement\u201d below and a copy of the Amendment which is included as Exhibit 99.2\nto McAfee\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on November 8, 2021.

If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a\nquorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Each \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d will also count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit\nadditional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card\nbut do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1)\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR,\u201d on a non-binding advisory basis, the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the\nadjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement at the time of the Special Meeting. \nQ: Have any McAfee Stockholders already agreed to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement? \nA: Yes. TPG VII Manta AIV I, L.P., TPG VII Manta Finance I, L.P., TPG VII Manta Blocker Co-Invest I, L.P., TPG VII Side-by-Side Separate Account I,\nL.P., TPG VII Manta Holdings II, L.P., TPG VII Manta AIV Co-Invest, L.P., and Intel Americas, Inc., which collectively own 65,591,599 shares of Class A\nCommon Stock and 227,349,460 shares of Class B Common Stock representing approximately 35.86% of the total outstanding Class A Common Stock and\n89.40% of the total outstanding Class B Common Stock, respectively, or approximately 67.91% of the total voting power of the Company Stock as of\nDecember 14, 2021, have entered into the Voting Agreement with Parent. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the foregoing entities have agreed, among\nother things, to vote their shares of Company Stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and against any competing transaction so\nlong as the Merger Agreement has not been terminated and\n \n20\nTable of Contents\nthe Board of Directors has not made an Adverse Recommendation Change. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014The Voting Agreement.\u201d\nQ: What happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by McAfee Stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, McAfee Stockholders\nwill not receive any payment for their shares of Company Stock. Instead, McAfee will remain an independent public company, the Class A Common Stock\nwill continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUnder specified circumstances, (a) McAfee will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of either $145,632,500 or $291,265,000, or (b) Parent will\nbe required to pay McAfee a termination fee of $582,530,000, in each case, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of\nthis proxy statement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fee.\u201d\nQ: Why are McAfee Stockholders being asked to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the Compensation Proposal? \nA: The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require McAfee to seek a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain payments\nthat could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ: What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?\nA: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to\nvote on the subject matter is required for approval of the Compensation Proposal.\nQ: What will happen if McAfee Stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting? \nA: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation\nProposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on McAfee. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is\ncompleted, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to McAfee\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.\nQ: What do I need to do now?\nA: You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the\nMerger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other\nthings, the Merger and how it affects you.

If\nyou sell or transfer your shares of Company Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision\nof a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies McAfee in writing of such\nspecial arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or\ntransfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of\nCompany Stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant\nyour proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\nQ: What is the difference between holding shares as a McAfee Stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? \nA: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (\u201cAST\u201d), you are\nconsidered, with respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly\nto you by McAfee.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of Company Stock held in\n\u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to\nthose shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your\nshares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of\nrecord, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ: How may I vote?\nA: If you are a McAfee Stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Company Stock are registered in your name with AST, our transfer agent),\nthere are four (4) ways to vote:\n \n \n\u2022\n by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Company Stock, and to\nconfirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions\nprovided in the enclosed proxy card).

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of our ongoing consideration and evaluation of our long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and McAfee\u2019s senior\nmanagement periodically review, consider and assess our operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions, as they may affect\nthose strategic goals and plans. This\n \n35Table of Contents\nreview includes, among other items, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures and other financial\nand strategic alternatives, in each case to maximize potential value for McAfee Stockholders.\nDuring the second half of 2019, OpCo LLC and its significant stockholders (i.e., TPG and Intel) (the \u201csignificant stockholders\u201d) evaluated several\nstrategic alternatives, including a potential initial public offering and the potential acquisition of OpCo LLC by a third party. In connection with such\nevaluation, Advent, Permira and GIC all entered into separate confidentiality agreements with OpCo LLC. They, along with several other potentially\ninterested parties, had meetings with the prior management team of OpCo LLC in September and October 2019. After such meetings, for various reasons,\nno transaction between any of such parties and OpCo LLC progressed further at that time. Further, OpCo LLC did not complete an initial public offering in\n2019. None of the parties with whom OpCo LLC had discussions at the time currently is restricted from making a proposal to acquire OpCo LLC.\nBetween July 2020 and early October 2020, OpCo LLC and the significant stockholders again evaluated whether there was market interest in a\npotential acquisition of OpCo LLC as an alternative to the initial public offering process that OpCo LLC was simultaneously pursuing. As part of this\nprocess, representatives from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC contacted 28 potential strategic parties. Except as set forth\nimmediately below, none of such parties, and no members of the Consortium (as defined below), participated in this process. OpCo LLC received one non-\nbinding preliminary written proposal throughout this process from Strategic Party B. This non-binding preliminary written proposal was received on\nOctober 7, 2020 and signaled the interest of Strategic Party B in acquiring only OpCo LLC\u2019s consumer business but made clear that Strategic Party B was\nnot interested in acquiring all of OpCo LLC. In addition, Strategic Party B indicated it was unable to pay an all-cash purchase price, and would have\nrequired the stockholders of OpCo LLC to accept equity in Strategic Party B as part of the transaction consideration for such acquisition. Because\nStrategic Party B\u2019s letter was preliminary in nature, the significant uncertainty as to whether the proposed transaction would materialize (and at what\nprice), the fact that Strategic Party B was unable to pay an all-cash purchase price and the private stockholders of OpCo LLC would have been required to\naccept equity in Strategic Party B as part of the transaction consideration for the proposed acquisition, the imminence of OpCo LLC\u2019s initial public\noffering in the following two weeks and the fact that this was a proposal for only a part of OpCo LLC, OpCo LLC and the significant stockholders elected\nnot to pursue this alternative further. Conversations with Strategic Party B did not progress beyond a preliminary phase.\nMcAfee\u2019s initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ (the \u201cIPO\u201d) priced after market close on October 21, 2020, and trading\ncommenced on October 22, 2020.\nIn late 2020, management of McAfee and the Board of Directors considered whether there might be market interest in a potential divestiture of\nMcAfee\u2019s Enterprise business (\u201cEnterprise\u201d). The Board of Directors launched a process for the evaluation of potential interest in Enterprise, which\nprocess lasted from December 2020 until McAfee and an affiliate of Symphony Technology Group entered into a definitive transaction agreement on\nMarch 6, 2021. The Enterprise transaction closed on July 27, 2021. Crosspoint and Advent entered into separate confidentiality agreements with McAfee\nin December 2020 and February 2021, respectively, in connection with the Enterprise transaction (due to the possibility that the prior confidentiality\nagreement in 2019 between McAfee and Advent could potentially expire during the Enterprise sale process). Both Crosspoint and Advent participated in\nmeetings with representatives from Goldman Sachs as well as members of McAfee management during the early stages of the Enterprise transaction.\nNeither Crosspoint nor Advent reached the final rounds of this process.\nIn May 2021, consistent with the Board of Directors\u2019 directives to regularly evaluate potential strategic alternatives, and to assess whether there\nwas any market interest in potential acquisition of McAfee that could be presented to the Board of Directors for consideration, management of McAfee\nrequested Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, consistent with their roles as financial advisors to McAfee, to lead high-level, preliminary discussions\nwith potential bidders. Given the increasing importance of cybersecurity at this time, McAfee determined that it would be prudent to assess market\ninterest in McAfee\u2019s business.\n \n36\nTable of Contents\nIn total, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, upon consultation with and at the direction of McAfee senior management,\ncontacted 23 potential financial and strategic parties. In May and June of 2021, members of McAfee\u2019s management team, engaged with a variety of\npotential bidders as set forth in greater detail below, including Advent, Permira, CPPIB, Crosspoint, and entities referred to herein as Financial Party A,\nFinancial Party B, Financial Party C, Financial Party D, Financial Party E, Financial Party F, Financial Party G, Strategic Party A and Strategic Party B. In\nMay and June of 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had telephone conversations and meetings with Financial Party A,\nFinancial Party B, Financial Party C, Financial Party D, Financial Party E and Financial Party F.\nOn May 12, 2021 and May 18, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley held an introductory meeting with members of\nPermira\u2019s management team regarding a general introduction regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn May 17, 2021, Timothy Millikin, a director on the Board of Directors who was nominated by TPG (the \u201csponsor director\u201d) spoke with Bryan\nTaylor, a Managing Partner of Advent (the \u201cAdvent representative\u201d), by phone. During this conversation, the sponsor director mentioned that\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs would be reaching out to Advent regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee. On May 18, representatives from\nGoldman Sachs held a meeting with Advent to provide a general introduction regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee. Advent did not enter into a\nnew confidentiality agreement with McAfee, as the prior confidentiality agreement executed in February 2021 between the parties remained in effect.\nOn May 23, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Permira, as the prior confidentiality agreement in 2019 between McAfee and\nPermira had expired.\nOn May 25, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party A. Also on May 25, McAfee entered into a confidentiality\nagreement with Financial Party A.\nOn May 26, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Financial Party B as well as one with Financial Party C. Also on May 26,\nrepresentatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as members of McAfee management, had a telephone conversation with Financial Party\nC to discuss an overview of McAfee\u2019s business generally. Also on May 26, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as members\nof McAfee management, held a meeting with Financial Party A.\nOn May 27, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Strategic Party B. Also on May 27, members of McAfee management had\nseparate telephone conversations with Strategic Party A and Financial Party B to discuss an overview of McAfee\u2019s business generally. Also on May 27,\nrepresentatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and members of McAfee management held a meeting with Permira at which a management\npresentation was given by McAfee management.\nOn May 28, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as members of McAfee management, held an introductory\nmeeting with Advent in which representatives from McAfee gave a management presentation to Advent. Also on May 28, members of McAfee\nmanagement had a telephone conversation with Strategic Party B to discuss an overview of McAfee\u2019s business generally. Also on May 28, the sponsor\ndirector engaged in a telephone conversation with representatives from Advent related to Advent\u2019s due diligence of McAfee.\nOn May 29, 2021, a representative from Advent contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs to request that Advent be permitted to formally\npartner with Permira, and permission was granted by McAfee shortly thereafter. Additionally, representatives from Advent and Permira separately\ndiscussed with representatives from Goldman Sachs their desire, and sought McAfee\u2019s permission, to partner together in any potential transaction and\nform a consortium with Crosspoint to acquire McAfee, which Advent and Permira acknowledged would require McAfee\u2019s consent. McAfee granted\npermission to Advent and Permira to partner together and with Crosspoint because of, among other things, the large amount of equity financing that\nwould be required to consummate any acquisition of McAfee and the greater likelihood that such financing could be obtained if Advent, Permira and\nCrosspoint were permitted to partner together to provide this financing.\n \n37\nTable of Contents\nOn May 30, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Financial Party D.\nOn June 1, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Financial Party E.\nOn June 2, 2021, McAfee entered into separate confidentiality agreements with CPPIB and Financial Party F.\nOn June 3, 2021, McAfee entered into a confidentiality agreement with Crosspoint. Also on June 3, representatives from Goldman Sachs and\nMorgan Stanley as well members of McAfee management held a meeting with CPPIB at which a management presentation was given by McAfee\nmanagement.\nDuring late May and June 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley conducted separate meetings with Advent, Permira,\nCrosspoint, CPPIB and each of Strategic Party A, Strategic Party B, Financial Party A, Financial Party B, Financial Party C, Financial Party D, Financial\nParty E, Financial Party F and Financial Party G. The purpose of these meetings was to assess each party\u2019s interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nThese parties generally declined to respond to further invitations to submit a proposal or ceased engaging with representatives from Goldman Sachs and\nMorgan Stanley with respect to a potential acquisition of McAfee. The sponsor director also had telephone conversations with Financial Party G and\nFinancial Party F on June 7 and June 10, respectively\u037e while the purpose of such conversations was to discuss the general status of McAfee\u2019s business,\nthere was no discussion of potential price or material terms of a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 3, 2021, representatives from Financial Party C contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs by telephone and indicated that they would\nnot pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 4, 2021, representatives from Strategic Party A contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs by telephone and indicated that they would\nbe potentially interested in a preferred equity financing commitment, but would not be interested in leading a transaction. Although representatives from\nGoldman Sachs subsequently introduced Strategic Party A to certain members of the Consortium, Strategic Party A did not pursue further a potential\nacquisition of McAfee.\nOn or around this time, each of Financial Party A and Strategic Party B ceased engaging in discussions with representatives from Goldman Sachs\nand Morgan Stanley, and neither pursued further a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 12, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs held a meeting with GIC regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 16, 2021, a senior investment professional from Advent contacted a senior investment professional from TPG by telephone to express\nAdvent\u2019s seriousness with respect to a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 17, 2021 members of McAfee management and representatives from Advent, Permira and Crosspoint held a meeting by video conference.\nAt this meeting, Advent, Permira and Crosspoint expressed continued interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee, with Advent and Permira leading the\npotential consortium.\nAlso on June 17, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting by video conference. Also in attendance were members of McAfee\nmanagement, as well as representatives from Ropes & Gray LLP (\u201cRopes\u201d), outside legal counsel to McAfee. Management of McAfee provided an\nupdate to the Board of Directors about the recent discussions with potential interested parties, including Advent, Permira and Crosspoint. A\nrepresentative from Ropes then reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Discussion ensued among the directors.\nThe Board of Directors then approved the continued outreach by representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to potential parties to assess\nthe interest level of those potential parties to enter into a transaction with McAfee.\n \n38\nTable of Contents\nOn or around June 21 through June 26, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director had various discussions with\nrepresentatives from Advent, including the Advent representative, and Permira, including discussing additional requests for due diligence information of\nMcAfee. Bryan Taylor was formerly a partner at TPG (having left that position in September 2017) and the prior chairman of the board of directors of\nOpCo LLC (having left that position in July 2017).\nOn June 23, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sent a process letter to Advent, Permira, Crosspoint, CPPIB, Financial\nParty B, Financial Party D, Financial Party F and Financial Party G, requesting submissions of preliminary, non-binding written indications of interest on\nan adjusted equity value basis that outline the terms and conditions of a potential transaction with McAfee. Shortly thereafter, Financial Party D\ncontacted representatives from Goldman Sachs to inform them that they would no longer pursue a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nThroughout late June 2021, CPPIB communicated to Goldman Sachs its interest in partnering with Advent regarding a potential transaction given\nAdvent\u2019s prior experience in the security software industry. McAfee denied this request due to its desire to have more separate bidders, and\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs instructed CPPIB to bid independently.\nOn June 25, 2021, certain members of McAfee management and representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley held a meeting with\nFinancial Party G, at which Financial Party G indicated interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 29, 2021, representatives from Financial Party D contacted representatives from Goldman Sachs by telephone and indicated that they\nwould not pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn June 30, 2021, four potentially interested parties submitted non-binding written indications of interest for an acquisition of McAfee based on\nlimited preliminary information, in each case subject to further diligence. Advent, Permira and Crosspoint submitted a joint, non-binding indication of\ninterest at an enterprise value of $15.0 billion, inclusive of certain presumed but unverified tax benefits. CPPIB submitted a separate non-binding\nindication of interest at an enterprise value of $14.25 billion, and noted that its bid was premised on the ability to partner with at least one other private\nequity investor. Financial Party G submitted a non-binding indication of interest at an enterprise value of $14 billion, and similarly noted that it would seek\nto partner with at least one other like-minded private equity investor. Financial Party F submitted a written non-binding indication of interest that did not\ninclude an enterprise value. Also, on June 30, 2021, Financial Party B submitted a separate oral indication of interest that did not include an enterprise\nvalue and was also premised on the ability to partner with at least one other investor. All other potential interested parties elected not to submit any\nproposal (whether orally or in writing) and did not pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nEach of the four written non-binding indications of interest included a preliminary estimate from each interested party of McAfee\u2019s adjusted equity\nvalue, exclusive of net debt, and (for several proposals) inclusive of certain tax assets that would be delivered to a potential acquirer. These estimates\nwere highly preliminary, were subject to diligence caveats and did not include or express any fixed per share price that would be paid that would facilitate\ncomparison across bidders. However, Goldman Sachs estimated various illustrative per share values implied by each of the non-binding indication of\ninterests based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions with respect to the dividends and debt payments that McAfee anticipated making in\nrespect of the sale of the Enterprise business, and cash forecasted to be generated through the end of 2021. Goldman Sachs\u2019 illustrative estimates of\nimplied per share values with respect to each non-binding indication of interest was as follows: $26.87 per share for Advent, Permira and Crosspoint\u2019s\u037e\n$26.45 per share for CPPIB\u2019s\u037e $24.63 per share for Financial Party G\u2019s\u037e $22.83 per share for Financial Party F\u2019s\u037e and $25.50 to $26.50 per share for Financial\nParty B\u2019s.\nOn July 2, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting. Also in attendance were members of McAfee management, and representatives from\nGoldman Sachs and Ropes. Representatives from Goldman Sachs briefed the Board of Directors on the status of discussions with potential parties,\nincluding Advent, Permira and Crosspoint\u2019s continued interest in pursuing a transaction with McAfee. Representatives from Goldman Sachs\n \n39\nTable of Contents\nreviewed with the Board of Directors the indications of interest received to date. Representatives from Goldman Sachs also provided an overview of the\nproposed transaction timeline, with potential buyers conducting diligence through July 2021 and submitting final bids by the first week of August 2021. A\nrepresentative from Ropes then reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. The Board of Directors discussed\npotential conflicts of interest that could arise in connection with a potential transaction, including the acceleration of potential payments to be made\nunder the TRA upon an acquisition of McAfee. The Board of Directors further discussed possible alternatives to eliminate or mitigate any such potential\nconflicts should they arise, and to align the interests of pre-IPO stockholders of McAfee and all other McAfee Stockholders in obtaining the highest\navailable price in any acquisition of McAfee. Following discussion, the Board of Directors provided direction to Goldman Sachs on the guidance to\nprovide the various bidders.\nOn July 3, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs advised Financial Party B that it could partner with Financial Party G, given both that\nFinancial Party B and Financial Party G had indicated an interest in partnering with one another, as well as the significant equity financing requirements to\nconsummate an acquisition. Around this time, representatives from Goldman Sachs separately advised Financial Party F that their proposal was not\nactionable on the pricing terms set forth in their proposal and encouraged them to submit more favorable pricing terms. Financial Party F declined to\nsubmit more favorable terms and, with certain exceptions (described below), did not pursue further a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn July 4, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley formally connected Financial Party B with Financial Party G to form a\njoint consortium.\nOn July 5, 2021, a representative from Goldman Sachs communicated that McAfee had granted permission to Advent, Permira and Crosspoint to\nutilize ADIA as a potential equity financing source.\nMcAfee granted permission to CPPIB (on July 9, 2021) to partner with Advent, Permira and Crosspoint (Advent and Permira as lead investors, with\nCPPIB and Crosspoint as named co-investors and ADIA (on July 9, 2021) and GIC (on July 12, 2021) as equity financing sources, collectively, the\n\u201cConsortium\u201d) regarding a potential transaction. Permission was granted to CPPIB because of, among other things, CPPIB\u2019s interest in partnering with\nAdvent and Permira, which interest CPPIB had previously communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs.\nAlso on July 9, 2021, representatives from each of Financial Party B and Financial Party G notified a representative from Goldman Sachs that they\nwould no longer pursue a potential acquisition of McAfee, indicating that they had decided not to proceed. Going forward as from this date, the sole\nbidder materially engaging in the process was the Consortium.\nOn July 12, 2021, McAfee also granted permission to GIC to transfer its interest in McAfee to Parent, and to receive equity in Parent as payment\ntherefor.\nOn July 14, 15 and 16, 2021, members of McAfee management held a series of meetings jointly attended by Advent, Permira, CPPIB, Crosspoint and\nADIA. On or around this time, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director communicated with representatives from Advent, which\ncommunications primarily related to a potential acquisition of McAfee. During this time, Ropes prepared a form of merger agreement and forms of other\ntransaction agreements that could be delivered to a potential strategic acquirer or a potential financial acquirer, should there be sufficient interest in and a\ndetermination by the Board of Directors to further pursue a potential acquisition of McAfee. On July 16, 2021, a draft form of merger agreement was\nprovided by McAfee to the Consortium.\nOn July 20, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sent a process letter to the Consortium requesting submission of a\ndefinitive written proposal for the acquisition of McAfee by August 5, 2021 and noting that the Board of Directors would consider such matters as it\ndeemed appropriate in evaluating such proposals, including (i) price, (ii) certainty and timing of closing such a transaction and (iii) the draft transaction\ndocuments. The July 20, 2021 bid process letter specifically requested bids on a per share basis.\nOn July 30, 2021, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP (\u201cFried Frank\u201d), counsel to the Consortium, sent an issues list to Ropes, which\nidentified issues for discussion in the draft merger agreement. The issues list\n \n40\nTable of Contents\nalso indicated that the Consortium would expect to receive a customary voting agreement from certain significant stockholders of McAfee in connection\nwith any transaction. Such voting agreement would require, among other things, that certain significant stockholders of McAfee vote in favor of the\ncontemplated transaction (subject to certain exceptions) with the Consortium.\nOn July 30, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting by video conference. Also present were members of McAfee management, as well as\nrepresentatives from Goldman Sachs and Ropes. Representatives from Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of the diligence process. Ropes\nreviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and also reviewed the issues list with respect to the draft merger\nagreement provided by Fried Frank. Discussion ensued among the directors. With input from representatives from Goldman Sachs and Ropes, the Board\nof Directors also discussed potential conflicts of interest, including the acceleration of potential payments due under the TRA. A representative from\nRopes informed the Board of Directors that each of TPG and Intel had agreed that they would be willing to waive any acceleration of TRA payments\notherwise due upon a change of control of McAfee in order to obtain the highest price per share for all McAfee Stockholders. In addition, certain\npreliminary, projected financial information was reviewed with the Board of Directors, including preliminary projections that had been prepared by\nMcAfee on May 29, 2021 and subsequently made available to prospective bidders (the \u201cMay 29 Projections\u201d), as well as certain other preliminary,\nprojected financial information. In addition, certain preliminary, projected financial information was reviewed with the Board of Directors. The Board of\nDirectors asked questions and discussion ensued.\nThe Board of Directors instructed representatives from Goldman Sachs and Ropes to notify Fried Frank that a full markup of the merger agreement\nwould be required before a substantive discussion on the merger agreement could occur.\nOn July 30 and August 1, 2021, the sponsor director had telephone conversations with Financial Party F during which the sponsor director\nencouraged Financial Party F to consider leading a potential acquisition of McAfee, as well as general discussions around the quality of McAfee\u2019s\nbusiness.\nOn August 3, 2021, representatives of Ropes and Fried Frank spoke by telephone. During such conversation, representatives of Ropes indicated to\nrepresentatives of Fried Frank that a full markup of the merger agreement would be required before a substantive discussion on the merger agreement\ncould occur.\nOn or around August 4 through August 7, 2021, various telephone conversations between representatives from McAfee and Advent occurred\nregarding the Consortium\u2019s due diligence requests.\nOn August 10 through August 17, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs spoke with Permira on the current nature of their interest in a\ntransaction and encouraged them to advance and complete their diligence and improve the terms of their proposal.\nOn August 14, 2021, Fried Frank, on behalf of the Consortium, submitted to Ropes a full markup of the merger agreement, which, among other\nthings, reflected the Consortium\u2019s expectation that certain significant stockholders of McAfee sign a voting agreement in connection with any\ncontemplated transaction.\nOn August 17, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs spoke with Advent and Permira and encouraged Advent and Permira and other members\nof the Consortium to improve the terms of their proposal and to move quickly to be in a position to execute a transaction. Permira called representatives\nfrom Goldman Sachs and indicated that the Consortium continued to have open diligence issues that prevented them from improving their terms or\nmaking a final proposal.\nOn August 19, 2021, McAfee terminated discussions with the Consortium, due to, among other things, disagreements about the terms and timeline\nupon which any transaction would occur as well as disagreements about access to due diligence materials related to McAfee.\n \n41\nTable of Contents\nOn September 7, 2021, McAfee publicly announced an underwritten public offering of 20,000,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock by certain\nselling McAfee Stockholders, which public offering was completed on September 14, 2021.\nOn September 23, 2021, in a conversation about other topics with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Financial Party G confirmed they continued\nto not have interest in a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn October 6, 2021, a representative from Advent contacted the sponsor director by telephone and discussed the Consortium\u2019s potential interest in\nre-engaging with McAfee regarding a potential acquisition of McAfee. Shortly thereafter, the representative from Advent discussed with McAfee\nmanagement and representatives from Goldman Sachs the Consortium\u2019s potential interest in re-engaging. \nOn October 8, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs, as well as members of McAfee management, held a meeting with representatives from\nAdvent, Permira, CPPIB, Crosspoint, ADIA and GIC to discuss McAfee\u2019s third quarter financials. At this meeting, there was no discussion of the\npotential price or material terms of a potential acquisition of McAfee.\nOn October 13, 2021, Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB submitted a revised non-binding proposal to McAfee providing for an acquisition by\nthe Consortium of McAfee at a price per share of $25.00 in cash, representing a premium over the closing price of $20.60 per share on that day, or\napproximately 21%. This proposal also attached a further revised markup of the merger agreement. In comparison to the August 14, 2021 markup that was\nsubmitted by Fried Frank, the October 13, 2021 markup, which, included, among other things, a higher proposed Parent Termination Fee, a lower proposed\nCompany Termination Fee and favorable changes to the go-shop and no-shop provisions, certain critical definitions, the financing covenants, the\nrepresentations and warranties, and the conduct of business covenant. The October 13, 2021 proposal also contained a request that McAfee sign a letter\nwith Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB providing for four weeks of exclusivity.\nOn October 14, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting. Also in attendance were members of McAfee management and representatives\nfrom Goldman Sachs and Ropes. Representatives from Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms of the Consortium\u2019s October 13,\n2021 proposal, as well as Goldman Sachs\u2019 preliminary financial analysis of the $25.00 price per share proposed in the October 13 proposal. A\nrepresentative from Ropes reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and then also reviewed with the Board of\nDirectors the material terms of the October 13 markup of the merger agreement and the request for exclusivity. Discussion ensued among the directors.\nThe Board of Directors deliberated on the improved terms of the October 13 proposal, including the request by Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB\nfor exclusivity. The Board of Directors instructed its legal and financial advisors to speak with Advent, Permira, Crosspoint and CPPIB\u2019s advisors and\nseek to further improve the terms of the October 13 proposal.\nAt the board meeting, it was also discussed that an affiliate of GIC that is a current McAfee Stockholder was having discussions to join the\nConsortium. Neither GIC nor such affiliate had at the time or currently has any representative on the Board of Directors. Further, neither was privy to any\nof the discussions or developments being discussed by the Board of Directors or involved in any discussions between McAfee and the Consortium.\nAdditional discussion ensued among the directors. Subsequent to the October 14, 2021 board meeting, at the direction of the Board of Directors, a\nrepresentative from Goldman Sachs conveyed to the Consortium that they would need to improve their proposed per share price to an amount above\n$25.00 per share.\nShortly after this meeting of the Board of Directors, a representative from Goldman Sachs communicated to the Consortium that McAfee would not\nenter into an exclusivity agreement in connection with the ongoing negotiations and that the Consortium would need to further improve the $25.00 per\nshare offer price. Because of this, McAfee did not enter into any exclusivity agreement with representatives from the Consortium or any members thereof\nprior to execution of the merger agreement.\n \n42\nTable of Contents\nOn October 15, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held a meeting with Advent, Permira, CPPIB and\nCrosspoint to discuss due diligence matters.\nOn October 19, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and members of McAfee management held another meeting with Advent, Permira, CPPIB\nand Crosspoint to discuss due diligence matters.

A representative from Goldman Sachs noted that negotiations with the Consortium were continuing, and that as part of its\nmost recent proposal, the Consortium had requested that McAfee suspend its quarterly dividend and for the TRA counterparties to waive the Ordinary\nCourse TRA Payments. The Board of Directors directed Goldman Sachs and McAfee management to continue to seek a more favorable price per share\nfrom the Consortium.\nA representative from Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Board of Directors the current financial terms of the proposed transaction. Discussion\nensued among the directors. A representative from Goldman Sachs noted that Financial Party F had contacted the sponsor director to propose a PIPE\ntransaction with McAfee, but that Financial Party F was not interested in an acquisition of all of McAfee, and that it was unclear how serious Financial\nParty F was with respect to the PIPE transaction or what timeline Financial Party F was contemplating for such a transaction. A representative from\nGoldman Sachs also noted that they recently spoke again with Financial Party G to assess Financial Party G\u2019s willingness to make a proposal to acquire\nMcAfee. However, Financial Party G declined to make a proposal.\nDuring the meeting, a representative from Ropes reviewed with the Board of Directors their fiduciary duties under Delaware law, and also reviewed\nwith the Board of Directors the status of the negotiations on the merger agreement. The representative from Ropes noted that while substantial progress\nhad been made on the principal transaction agreements, certain open issues remained. In particular, the representative from Ropes noted that the parties\nwere still negotiating, among other open points, the closing conditions, acceleration of equity awards, financing of the transaction, certain critical\ndefinitions, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, the terms of the \u201cgo shop\u201d provision and the \u201cno shop\u201d provision, the Board of Directors\u2019 rights to\nmake an adverse recommendation change, the quarterly dividend, the Tax Distributions and the Ordinary Course TRA Payments, the proposed Parent\nTermination Fee and other matters. The directors deliberated on the open points and instructed members of management and representatives from\nGoldman Sachs and Ropes to seek to obtain the most favorable terms possible for McAfee Stockholders.\nThe chief financial officer of McAfee then reviewed with the Board of Directors the proposed long term strategic plan (the \u201cStrategic Plan\u201d) for\nMcAfee, and discussed numerous topics relevant to the Strategic Plan, including assumptions and financial projections underlying the Strategic Plan.\nCertain assumptions reflected in the financial projections prepared in connection with the Strategic Plan had been updated from prior assumptions that\nhad been\n \n44\nTable of Contents\nmade in connection with the May 29 Projections. The updated assumptions were based on subsequent developments, including without limitation the\npotential impact of recently announced M&A transactions and market activity that impacted McAfee\u2019s competitive landscape, as well as additional\nstrategic planning meetings conducted with the input of a new executive officer who joined after McAfee became a consumer-only company. The\nupdated assumptions reflected in the financial projections resulted in lower forecasted growth in McAfee\u2019s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation,\nand Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) as compared to the May 29 Projections, among other updates. Discussion then ensued among the directors on the\nStrategic Plan.

On that call, the representatives of Advent and Permira, on behalf of the Consortium, delivered a proposal to resolve a number of open points.\nLater on November 4, 2021, Fried Frank sent a written proposal, which reflected the terms previously conveyed to Goldman Sachs, to Ropes. The\nproposal, among other things, proposed a price per share of $25.75\u037e limited acceleration of equity awards, permitted McAfee to make the Tax Distributions\nto members of OpCo LLC\u037e required that the TRA be terminated conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing\u037e required the Ordinary Course TRA\nPayments to be canceled\u037e required that the quarterly dividend be suspended\u037e provided for a proposed 5% Parent Termination Fee\u037e accepted proposed\ncompromises on the \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d and \u201cintervening event\u201d definitions, and other matters.\n \n45\nTable of Contents\nOn November 4, 2021, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director had separate telephone conversations with representatives\nfrom Advent and Permira, and a representative from McAfee had a separate telephone conversation with representatives from Advent, regarding the\nproposal, including potential modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that would raise the price per share to $26.00 in cash (representing a\npremium over the then-current share price of approximately 22.6%) and suspend and, upon the closing of the Merger, terminate McAfee\u2019s obligation to\nmake the Tax Distributions to members of OpCo LLC. Ropes sent a counterproposal (the \u201cMcAfee Counterproposal\u201d) back to Fried Frank containing\nthese modifications and otherwise in general accepting the other terms of the Consortium\u2019s November 4 proposal. After additional discussion between\nthe parties, the Consortium agreed to the McAfee Counterproposal. Also on November 4, representatives from Goldman Sachs and the sponsor director\nhad separate telephone conversations with representatives from Advent and Permira clarifying the terms of the limited acceleration of equity awards.\nAlso on November 4, Fried Frank provided to Ropes draft preferred equity commitment letters.\nDuring the evening of November 4, 2021, the Board of Directors held a board meeting by video conference. A representative from Goldman Sachs\nprovided an update to the Board of Directors and communicated that the Consortium had agreed to increase the price per Class A Common Stock share to\n$26.00 in cash and otherwise described the McAfee Counterproposal that had been accepted by the Consortium. The representative from Goldman Sachs\nnoted that this approach was consistent with the Board of Directors\u2019 previous discussions. A representative from Goldman Sachs then reviewed its\nfinancial analyses and rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nNovember 5, 2021, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion, the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to the McAfee Stockholders (other than Parent, Snowlake and\ntheir respective Affiliates), taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such McAfee\nStockholders as further described in the section \u201c\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

The representative from Ropes\nnext reviewed with the Board of Directors the status of the negotiations with the Consortium and its advisors and that there were still items under\nnegotiation in the draft merger agreement, and that Ropes and Goldman Sachs were still negotiating those items. The representative from Ropes reviewed\nwith the Board of Directors the terms of the transaction agreements reflective of the McAfee Counterproposal, including, without limitation, the terms of\nthe merger agreement, including without limitation the structure of the merger, limited acceleration of equity awards, the \u201cgo shop\u201d provision, the \u201cno\nshop\u201d provision, the Board of Directors\u2019 rights to make an adverse recommendation change, the proposed Company Termination Fee of 1.25% or 2.5%,\nand the proposed Parent Termination Fee of 5%, efforts to obtain regulatory clearances, closing conditions, the definition of \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u037e\u201d the\nvoting agreement that would be signed by TPG and Intel to support the transaction and the fact that the voting support under that voting agreement\nwould immediately cease upon the Board of Directors making an adverse recommendation change or upon termination of the merger agreement\u037e\nsuspension of the quarterly dividend\u037e the amendment to the TRA and OpCo LLC Agreement to effect the suspension and, conditional upon the\noccurrence of the Closing, the elimination of certain payments due under the TRA (including the Ordinary Course TRA Payments and any change of\ncontrol payments associated with the transaction) and Tax Distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement\u037e the equity commitment letters\u037e the debt\ncommitment letters\u037e the fee funding agreements\u037e and the agreement to be signed by the affiliate of GIC and the Consortium. Discussion then ensued\namong the Board of Directors and with their advisors. The directors discussed the favorable outcome on the improvement of the price to $26.00 per share\nin cash payable to all of the McAfee Stockholders generally, and instructed management, and representatives from Ropes and Goldman Sachs to resolve\nany remaining open points in a manner as favorable as possible to the McAfee Stockholders and otherwise in accordance with the Board of Directors\u2019\ninstructions. Subject to that instruction, the Board of Directors authorized management to execute and deliver the merger agreement and the other\ntransaction agreements once the McAfee Counterproposal had been reflected in the transaction agreements and any remaining open points had been\nresolved. The compensation committee of the Board of Directors also met and adopted resolutions to authorize the treatment of equity awards as\nprovided in the merger agreement.\nDuring the evening of November 4, 2021 and continuing throughout November 5, 2021, the parties memorialized the McAfee Counterproposal in\nthe transaction agreements and continued to negotiate and resolve\n \n46\nTable of Contents\nthe open points in the merger agreement and the other transaction agreements. Late in the afternoon on November 5, several news outlets published a\nstory that McAfee was considering a proposed transaction with the Consortium. At the close of trading on November 5, 2021, McAfee\u2019s stock price had\nincreased approximately 20% over the previous day\u2019s closing price. Also on November 5, members of McAfee management and representatives from\nGoldman Sachs held a meeting with representatives from Advent, Permira, CPPIB and Crosspoint. In addition, on November 5, 2021, representatives from\nGoldman Sachs delivered to the Board of Directors an updated written presentation of certain financial analyses to reflect the most recent capitalization of\nMcAfee included in the November 5, 2021 draft of the merger agreement. Late in the evening on November 5, the parties executed and delivered the\nMerger Agreement and the other principal transaction agreements, including the amendment to the TRA and OpCo LLC Agreement executed and\ndelivered by holders of the requisite percentage of beneficiaries to the TRA.\nUpon the execution of the Merger Agreement, all standstill provisions (that were contained in confidentiality agreements with prospective bidders)\nproviding for a fall away upon a public announcement of a sale of McAfee, automatically released, except as set forth below. The confidentiality\nagreements between McAfee and three potentially interested parties each contained a standstill restriction and a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision\nprohibiting the potentially interested parties from requesting that McAfee waive or amend the standstill restrictions, but did not provide for a fall away\nupon a public announcement of a sale of McAfee. On December 20, 2021, McAfee advised each of these three potentially interested parties that McAfee\nwas waiving the standstill provision (including the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision) in the confidentiality agreements in order to permit each of these\nparties to make a private and confidential acquisition proposal to the Board of Directors.\nAlso on November 5, 2021, Goldman Sachs delivered its written opinion to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of the date of such written\nopinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock to be paid to the\nMcAfee Stockholders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective Affiliates), taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, was fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to such McAfee Stockholders.\nOn the morning of November 8, 2021, McAfee and the Consortium publicly announced the entry into the Merger Agreement via a joint press\nrelease.\nOn November 19, 2021, McAfee, Parent and Merger Subsidiary executed an amendment to the Merger Agreement to remove certain jurisdictions\nfrom the closing conditions set forth in Sections 9.01(b) and 9.01(c) relating to certain regulatory approvals and restraints. Since the execution of the\nMerger Agreement, in connection with the Go Shop Period provided for in the Merger Agreement, which expired at 11:59 p.m. New York City Time on\nDecember 20, 2021, at the direction of the Board of Directors, representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have communicated with 37\nadditional parties, consisting of 18 potential strategic parties and 19 potential financial sponsors, to gauge such parties\u2019 interest in making an alternative\nAcquisition Proposal. McAfee did not execute a confidentiality agreement with any of those 37 parties. To date, no party has made an alternative\nAcquisition Proposal.",

proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger\nAgreement at the time of the Special Meeting.\nReasons for the Merger\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board of Directors consulted with McAfee\u2019s management and its legal and financial\nadvisors and, in reaching its decision to, among other things, approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger and to recommend that McAfee\nStockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a variety of factors, including the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n historical information regarding (i) McAfee\u2019s business, financial performance and results of operations, (ii) market prices, volatility and\ntrading activity with respect to the Company Stock, and (iii) market prices with respect to other industry participants and general market\nindices\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n current information regarding (i) McAfee\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, products, services,\nmanagement, competitive position and strategic business goals and objectives, (ii) general economic, industry and financial market\nconditions, (iii) geopolitical conditions (including, without limitation, tariffs and COVID-19) which are affecting McAfee\u2019s business, and (iv)\nopportunities and competitive factors within McAfee\u2019s industry\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n ongoing efforts and uncertainty relating to COVID-19\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the changing competitive landscape, including acquisitions and dispositions by competitors and solicitation by

of\nMcAfee\u2019s dealings with other possible buyers in the past and assessment of the likelihood that a third party would offer a higher price than\nthe price per share of Company Stock offered by Parent\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the timing of the Merger and the risk that if McAfee does not accept the Parent offer now (as provided for in the Merger Agreement), it may\nnot have another opportunity

above\nMcAfee\u2019s stock price prior to news of the transaction being publicly available\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the fact that the amount of cash to be received for each outstanding share of Company

of McAfee\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the belief of the Board of Directors that it is preferable to enter into the Merger Agreement with Parent instead of any of the other\nprospective interested parties in the strategic alternatives process in light of the prices offered by those other prospective interested\nparties, the lack of interest by prospective interested parties and the fact that those other prospective interested parties made significantly\nless progress on due diligence, particularly in light of:\n \n \n\u2022\n (1) the risk that continuing with the strategic process was unlikely to result in a transaction at a more attractive price than offered by\nParent in the Merger and that a \u201cfailed\u201d attempt to sell McAfee could be detrimental to McAfee\u037e and\n \n48\nTable of

contains a \u201cgo shop\u201d provision permitting McAfee to actively solicit parties to seek to obtain a\nhigher offer during the Go-Shop Period together with the payment of the Company Termination Fee, (2) after the Go Shop Period, McAfee\ncan still entertain unsolicited acquisition proposals that are more favorable from a financial perspective, (3) the Merger Agreement obligates\nMcAfee to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee under specified circumstances, which could discourage the making of a competing\nacquisition proposal or adversely impact the price offered in such a

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial\nanalyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nGoldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with\nthe full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following\nquantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before November 5, 2021, the last trading\nday before the public announcement of the transaction, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nImplied Premia and Multiples\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared certain implied premia and multiples described below based on the $26.00 in cash per share of Company\nStock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective affiliates) of shares of Company Stock pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement.\n \n52\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock relative to:\n \n \n\u2022\n $21.21, the unaffected closing price for the Class A Common Stock on November 4, 2021, the last trading day prior to media reports\nregarding a potential sale of McAfee (the \u201cCurrent Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n $21.78, the volume weighted average price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of the Class A Common Stock over the 10-trading day time period ended November 4,\n2021 (\u201c10-day VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n $21.59, the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock over the 20-trading day time period ended November 4, 2021 (\u201c20-day VWAP\u201d)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n $21.74, the VWAP of the Class A Common Stock over the 30-trading day time period ended November 4, 2021 (\u201c30-day VWAP\u201d).\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons were as follows:\n \nClass A Common Stock Reference Price\n \nImplied\nPremium\nRepresented\nby\n$26.00 in\nCash per\nShare of\nCompany\nStock\n \nCurrent Share Price of $21.21\n \n \n23%\n10-day VWAP of $21.78\n \n \n19%\n20-day VWAP of $21.59\n \n \n20%\n30-day VWAP of $21.74\n \n \n20%\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied equity value for McAfee for purposes of calculating the following multiples by multiplying the\n$26.00 in cash per share of Company Stock by the total number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Company Stock as of November 4, 2021, as\nprovided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of McAfee. Goldman Sachs then calculated an\nimplied enterprise value of McAfee by adding to the implied equity value it calculated the net debt of McAfee as of September 25, 2021, as provided by\nthe management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of McAfee.\nUsing the foregoing, Goldman Sachs calculated the following implied multiples:\n \n \n\u2022\n the implied enterprise value for McAfee as a multiple of calendar years 2021 and 2022 revenues of McAfee, based on Institutional Brokers\u2019\nEstimate System (\u201cIBES\u201d) consensus estimates and as reflected in the Forecasts\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the implied enterprise value for McAfee as a multiple of the estimates of McAfee\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and\namortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) (including stranded costs related to divestitures but excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of\nacquired intangibles and other one-time expenses) (\u201cAdj. EBITDA\u201d) for calendar years 2021 and 2022, based on IBES consensus estimates\nand as reflected in the Forecasts.\nThe results of these calculations were as follows:\n \nImplied Enterprise Value as a Multiple of:\n \nImplied Multiples\n \n \nCurrent\nShare\nPrice of\n$21.21   \n$26.00\nper share\nof\nMcAfee\nCompany\nStock\n \nCY21 EV/Revenue (Forecasts)\n \n \n6.2x  \n \n7.4x \nCY21 EV/Revenue (Consensus Estimates)\n \n \n6.4x  \n \n7.6x \nCY22 EV/Revenue (Forecasts)\n \n \n5.5x  \n \n6.5x \nCY22 EV/Revenue (Consensus Estimates)\n \n \n5.7x  \n \n6.8x \nCY21 EV/Adj.

(\u201cNorton\u201d)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n Avast PLC (\u201cAvast\u201d).\nAlthough neither of the Selected Companies is directly comparable to McAfee, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly\ntraded companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of McAfee.\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared next-twelve month (\u201cNTM\u201d) Adj. EBITDA multiples for McAfee and each of the selected companies,\nbased on financial and trading data as of November 4, 2021, information Goldman Sachs obtained from Capital IQ, publicly available historical data, market\ndata and IBES consensus estimates. NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples for McAfee were calculated based on the Forecasts and for Norton and Avast were\ncalculated based on IBES consensus estimates. Goldman Sachs calculated average NTM EV/Adj. EBITDA multiples over certain time periods prior to and\nincluding November 4, 2021.\nThe results of these calculations are summarized as follows:\n \nNTM EV/Adj. EBITDA Multiples Over Time(1)\n \nAverage in\n \nMcAfee  \nNorton  \nAvast \n2021\n \n 13.1x  \n 11.6x  \n 14.1x \n2020\n \n 10.0x  \n 10.0x  \n 14.0x \n2019\n \n \nN/A  \n 10.3x  \n 10.9x \n2018\n \n \nN/A  \n \n8.5x  \n 9.6x \n2017\n \n \nN/A  \n \n9.4x  \n N/A \nAverage over last\n \n \n \n1-Month\n \n 13.2x  \n 11.6x  \n N/A \n1-Year\n \n 12.8x  \n 11.5x  \n 14.1x \n3-Year\n \n \nN/A  \n 10.5x  \n 12.8x \nNovember 4, 2021\n \n 12.8x  \n 11.4x  \n 14.6(2) \n \n(1)\nDefined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other one-time expenses.\n(2)\nReflects Avast unaffected multiple as of July 14, 2021 (undisturbed by Norton/Avast merger rumors).\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on McAfee to derive a range of illustrative present\nvalues per share of Company Stock. Using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting estimates of McAfee\u2019s weighted average cost of capital,\nand the mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of September 25, 2021 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow including\nstock-based compensation (\u201cUFCF\u201d) for McAfee for the years 2021 through 2025 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal\nvalues for McAfee, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow\nto be generated by McAfee, as provided by management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of McAfee (which analysis\nimplied exit terminal year NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples ranging from 8.4x to 12.7x). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the\nCapital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the\n \n54\nTable of Contents\ncost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as\ncertain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing\nits professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic\nproduct and inflation.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for McAfee by adding the range of present values it derived as described above.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for McAfee the net debt of McAfee as of September 25, 2021, as\nprovided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of McAfee, to derive a range of illustrative equity values\nfor McAfee. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of McAfee,\nas provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of McAfee, using the treasury stock method, to derive\na range of illustrative present values per share of Company Stock ranging from $19.45 to $29.89.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of Company Stock, which is\ndesigned to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s estimated\nfuture Adj. EBITDA and assumed one-year forward enterprise value to Adj. EBITDA multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for\neach of the fiscal years 2022 through 2024. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values for McAfee as of December 31 for each of the\nyears 2021 to 2023 by applying enterprise value to NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x to NTM Adj. EBITDA estimates for each of the years\n2022 to 2024 based on the Forecasts. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and\nexperience, taking into account current and historical enterprise value to NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples for McAfee and current and historical enterprise\nvalue to NTM Adj. EBITDA multiples for certain selected companies (as described above under \u201c\u2014Selected Public Company Comparables Analysis\u201d).\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of McAfee\u2019s forecasted net debt as of December 31, 2021 to 2023, each as provided by the management\nMcAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of McAfee, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for McAfee as of December\n31 for each of the years 2021 to 2023. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of projected year-end fully diluted shares of Company Stock\nfor each of the years 2021 to 2023, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of McAfee, to\nderive a range of implied future share prices. Goldman Sachs then discounted the December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2023 implied future share prices\nback to September 25, 2021 using an illustrative discount rate of 8.5% to derive implied present values of future shares prices as of September 25, 2021.\nGoldman Sachs then added to the implied present values of future shares prices the total present values, as of September 25, 2021, using an illustrative\ndiscount rate of 8.5%, of forecasted dividends through each of the years 2021 to 2023, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of McAfee. The illustrative discount rate of 8.5% reflected an estimate of McAfee\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman\nSachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Price Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for\nthe company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present\nvalues of $17.80 to $31.01 per share of Company Stock.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the software industry since 2015.\nFor each of the selected transactions where information was publicly available, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied EV/ NTM EBITDA of\nthe applicable target company based on the total consideration paid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s NTM EBITDA based on IBES\nestimates at the time each such selected transaction was announced.\n \n55\nTable of Contents\nWhile none of the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to McAfee, the target companies that\nparticipated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purpose of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of McAfee\u2019s\nresults, market size and product profile.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\n \nAnnouncement Year\n \nTarget\n \nAcquiror\n \nDeal\nValue\n(in\nbillions)  \nEV/NTM\nEBITDA  \n2021\n \nAvast PLC \u2013 Stock Election\n \nNortonLifeLock Inc.\n \n$\n8.3  \n 15.0x/9.9x(1) \n2021\n \nAvast PLC \u2013 Cash Election\n \nNortonLifeLock Inc.\n \n \n9.0  \n 16.5/10.9(1) \n2021\n \nProofpoint, Inc.\n \nThoma Bravo\n \n \n12.2  \n \n54.1 \n2021\n \nMcAfee Corp.

Goldman Sachs then subtracted net debt for McAfee as\nof September 25, 2021, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of McAfee, from the range\nof implied enterprise values to determine a range of implied equity values for McAfee. Goldman Sachs then divided these equity values by the number of\nfully diluted outstanding shares of Company Stock, as provided by the management of McAfee and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the\nmanagement of McAfee, using the treasury stock method. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of Company Stock of\n$19.89 to $37.26.\n \n56\nTable of Contents\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions announced\nfrom 2012 through November 4, 2021, involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the\ntransaction was greater than $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 20th percentile\nand 80th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the\ntransaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29.5% across the period. This analysis also indicated a 20th percentile premium of 15.7% and\n80th percentile premium of 54.1% across the period. Using this analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 15.7% to 54.1%\nto the unaffected closing price per share of Company Stock of $21.21 as of November 4, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of\nCompany Stock of $24.54 to $32.68.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to McAfee or the contemplated merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view of the merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent, Snowlake and their respective affiliates) of shares of\nCompany Stock, taken in the aggregate, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily\nreflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of\nactual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject\nto uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of McAfee, Parent,\nGoldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between McAfee and Parent and was approved by the Board of\nDirectors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to McAfee during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific merger\nconsideration to McAfee or the Board of Directors or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the\nmerger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors\nin making its determination to approve the transaction.

In addition,\nMcAfee has entered into certain arrangements with its executive officers and directors relating to their equity awards, as described below.\nEach of the Management Incentive Unit, Company RSU and Company PSU award agreements with Peter Leav and Venkat Bhamidipati provide that\nin the event of a change in control, such as the Merger, vesting of Peter Leav\u2019s and Venkat Bhamidipati\u2019s awards will accelerate in full (and, in the case of\nCompany PSUs, will be deemed earned based on the greater of target performance and actual performance of McAfee and/or OpCo, LLC, as applicable,\nthrough the date of the change in control (or an earlier date selected for administrative convenience)) as of immediately prior to the change in control,\nprovided that Peter Leav or Venkat Bhamidipati, as applicable, remains employed through the date of the change in control.\nGagandeep Singh\u2019s offer letter provides that if he remains employed through the date of a change of control, such as the Merger, that occurs within\ntwelve (12) months of his start date, 25% of his Company RSUs will vest as of immediately prior to such change in control.\nIn connection with McAfee\u2019s initial public offering (or, with respect to Gagandeep Singh, his commencement of employment with McAfee),\nMcAfee entered into change in control severance agreements (the \u201cSeverance Agreements\u201d) with our executive officers (other than Peter Leav). Pursuant\nto the terms of the Severance Agreements, if an executive officer\u2019s employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the Severance Agreement), or\nthe executive officer terminates the executive officer\u2019s employment with McAfee for good reason (as defined in the Severance Agreement), in either case,\nduring the period beginning three (3) months prior to, and ending 18 months following, the consummation of a change in control, such as the Merger (a\n\u201cQualifying Termination\u201d), all of the executive officer\u2019s unvested time-based equity awards will accelerate and vest in full as of the date of the executive\nofficer\u2019s termination of employment and all performance-based equity awards granted following McAfee\u2019s initial public offering will vest as of the\nseparation date based on the higher of target performance and actual performance through the date of termination of employment, as applicable, in\naccordance with the documents governing such performance-based equity award.\nAdditionally, the Company RSU award agreements with each of McAfee\u2019s non-employee directors provide that in the event of a change in control,\nsuch as the Merger, all then-outstanding Company RSUs subject to the award will accelerate and vest in full immediately prior to such change in control.\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 14, 2021, for each of McAfee\u2019s executive officers and directors, the number of unvested\nManagement Incentive Units of OpCo LLC, unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs, and the estimated consideration that each such holder would\nbe entitled to receive in respect of such unvested Management Incentive Units of OpCo LLC and unvested Company Awards in connection with the\nMerger, assuming that the price per share of the Company Stock is $26.00, which equals the Per Share Consideration, and for Company PSUs eligible to\nbe earned based on our 2021 fiscal year performance, based on 130% of the target number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSUs,\nand for Company PSUs eligible to to be earned based on our performance for our 2022 fiscal year or 2023 fiscal year, based on the target number of shares\nof Company Stock subject to awards of Company PSUs.\n \n64\nTable of Contents\n \n \nNumber of\nUnvested\nManagement\nIncentive\nUnits\n  \nTotal\nConsideration\nfor Unvested\nManagement\nIncentive\nUnits(1)\n  \nNumber of\nShares\nUnderlying\nUnvested\nCompany\nRSUs(2)\n  \nTotal\nConsideration\nfor Unvested\nCompany\nRSUs(1)\n  \nNumber of\nShares\nUnderlying\nUnvested\nCompany\nPSUs(2)\n  \nTotal\nConsideration\nfor Unvested\nCompany\nPSUs (1)\n  \nAggregate\nConsideration\nfor Unvested\nManagement\nIncentive Units\nand Company\nAwards(1)\n \nPeter Leav\n  \n702,924  $\n16,069,756   1,579,380  $\n48,132,984   \n543,311  $\n16,557,883  $\n80,760,623 \nVenkat Bhamidipati\n  \n550,000  $\n12,681,350   \n736,619  $\n19,152,094   \n0  $\n0  $\n31,833,444 \nAshish Agarwal\n  \n118,396  $\n2,615,166   \n321,420  $\n8,356,920   \n83,003  $\n2,158,078  $\n13,130,164 \nGagandeep Singh\n  \n0  $\n0   1,143,118  $\n29,721,068   \n0  $\n0  $\n29,721,068 \nSohaib Abbasi\n  \n0  $\n0   \n18,135  $\n471,510   \n0  $\n0  $\n471,510 \nMary Cranston\n  \n0  $\n0   \n18,135  $\n471,510   \n0  $\n0  $\n471,510 \nTim Millikin\n  \n0  $\n0   \n0  $\n0   \n0  $\n0  $\n0 \nKathy Willard\n  \n0  $\n0   \n18,135  $\n471,510   \n0  $\n0  $\n471,510 \nJohn Winkelried\n  \n0  $\n0   \n0  $\n0   \n0  $\n0  $\n0 \nJeff Woolard\n  \n0  $\n0   \n0  $\n0   \n0  $\n0  $\n0 \nGunther Bright\n  \n0  $\n0   \n7,575  $\n196,950   \n0  $\n0  $\n196,950 \nEmily Rollins\n  \n0  $\n0   \n6,878  $\n178,828   \n0  $\n0  $\n178,828 \n \n(1)\nInclusive of deferred cash payments payable in respect of Peter Leav\u2019s Company RSU and Company PSU awards.

The following summary does not\nconstitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that McAfee Stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section\n262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder,\u201d \u201cholder of shares of Company Stock\u201d or \u201cMcAfee Stockholder\u201d are to the\nrecord holder of shares of Company Stock unless otherwise expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of shares of Company Stock is entitled to\ndemand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Company Stock held of record in the\nname of another person, such as a bank, broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or custodian), depositary or other nominee, must act promptly to\ncause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of\nCompany Stock through a bank, broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your\nbank, broker or the other nominee.\n \n70Table of Contents\nUnder Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of shares of Company Stock who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal of their shares\u037e\n(ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time\u037e and\n(iv) otherwise exactly follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand to receive payment in cash of the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Company Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. However, after\nan appraisal petition has been filed, Section 262 provides that the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all McAfee\nStockholders who have asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected\nexceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262\u037e or (b) the value of the aggregate\nPer Share Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million\n(conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the \u201cownership thresholds\u201d). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for\ngood cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at\n5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, at any time before the\nDelaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may voluntarily pay to each McAfee Stockholder\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such payment\nonly on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is\nunder no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, such as the Special Meeting, the corporation, not\nless than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement\nconstitutes McAfee\u2019s notice to McAfee Stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex E. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of Company Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review this discussion and Annex E carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A McAfee Stockholder who loses\nhis, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the\ncomplexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Company Stock, McAfee believes that if a McAfee Stockholder\nconsiders exercising such rights, that McAfee Stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nMcAfee Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Company Stock must do ALL of the following:\n \n \n\u2022\n the McAfee Stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the McAfee Stockholder must deliver to McAfee a written demand for appraisal before the vote by the McAfee Stockholders on the Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n the McAfee Stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Company Stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective\nTime (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n the McAfee Stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Company Stock held either in a voting trust or by a\nnominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must\n \n71\nTable of Contents\n \nfile a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective\nTime. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nIn addition, one of the ownership thresholds articulated in Section 262(g) must be met.\nBecause a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a\nMcAfee Stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain\nor not vote the shares.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Company Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to McAfee, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to McAfee Stockholders, a written demand for\nthe appraisal of the McAfee Stockholder\u2019s shares, and that McAfee Stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement. A holder of shares of Company Stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal\nis made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions\nwill, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the McAfee Stockholder\u2019s appraisal\nrights. Therefore, a McAfee Stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to\nvote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, or otherwise fail to vote, on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither\nvoting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will,\nin and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition\nto and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not\nconstitute a demand. A McAfee Stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote of McAfee Stockholders on the adoption\nof the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Company Stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand\nfor appraisal in respect of shares of Company Stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform McAfee of the\nidentity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares\nare owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf\nof the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a demand\nfor appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the\ndemand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nMCAFEE STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO\nWISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO\nDETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF\nTHOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A\nBANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY\nMANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\n \n72\nTable of Contents\nAll demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be in writing and should be mailed or delivered to:\nMcAfee Corp.\nAttention: Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer\n6220 America Center Drive\nSan Jose, CA 95002\nwith a copy to:\nRopes & Gray LLP\n1900 University Avenue\nEast Palo Alto, CA 94303\nAttention: Paul S. Scrivano, Esq.\nAt any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company Stock who has delivered a written demand to McAfee and\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept\nthe Per Share Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to McAfee a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.\nHowever, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time shall require written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any McAfee Stockholder without the approval of the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however,\nthat this provision shall not affect the right of any McAfee Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such McAfee Stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the Per Share Consideration within 60 days after the Effective\nTime.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of Company Stock\nwho has properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,\nthat the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of Company Stock who has complied\nwith Section 262 and is entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of shares of Company Stock held\neither in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a McAfee Stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a\ndetermination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting McAfee Stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and McAfee Stockholders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition\nor initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of Company Stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Company Stock who\ndesire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Company Stock\nwithin the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Company Stock to file such a petition within the period specified in\nSection 262 could nullify the McAfee Stockholder\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\n \n73\nTable of Contents\nWithin 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Company Stock who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and who is\nentitled to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the\naggregate number of shares of Company Stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which McAfee has\nreceived demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail such statement to the\nrequesting McAfee Stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days\nafter the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of Company Stock held either in a\nvoting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving\nCorporation the statement described in the two previous sentences. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a McAfee\nStockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Company Stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served upon the\nSurviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a\nduly verified list containing the names and addresses of all McAfee Stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that\nnotice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the McAfee Stockholders shown on\nsuch verified list at the addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of\ngeneral circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. The costs of\nthese notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation. After notice to McAfee Stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is\nempowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those McAfee Stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become\nentitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the McAfee Stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to\nsubmit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any McAfee\nStockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss that McAfee Stockholder from the proceedings. The\nDelaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all McAfee Stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless one of the ownership\nthresholds is met.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Company Stock entitled to appraisal and that at least one of the ownership thresholds described above has been\nsatisfied as to McAfee Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will\ndetermine the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Company Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the\nMerger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any\nvoluntary cash payments made by the surviving corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 that have the effect of limiting the sum on which\ninterest accrues as described below). In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court\nin its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the\nperiod between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment\nin the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each McAfee Stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such\ninterest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid\nat such time.\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nIn Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal\nproceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and\notherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light\non future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation.\nIn Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or\nsusceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nMcAfee Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their\nshares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not\nan opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair\nvalue as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and McAfee Stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a\ndetermination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Consideration. Neither McAfee nor Parent anticipates offering more than the\nPer Share Consideration to any McAfee Stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of McAfee and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary\ncash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a\nshare of Company Stock is less than the Per Share Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above has been satisfied as to McAfee Stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the\nappraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a McAfee Stockholder,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a McAfee Stockholder in connection with an appraisal\nproceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the\nshares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.\nIf any McAfee Stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Company Stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or\nsuccessfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the McAfee Stockholder\u2019s shares of Company Stock will be deemed to have been converted at\nthe Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration, without interest. A McAfee Stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or\nwithdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds\ndescribed above is met or if the McAfee Stockholder properly delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no McAfee Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Company\nStock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s\nshares of Company Stock, if any, payable to McAfee Stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither\nof the ownership thresholds described above is met, or if the McAfee Stockholder delivers to the\n \n75\nTable of Contents\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time\nor thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such McAfee Stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition\nfor appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any McAfee Stockholder\nwithout the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just\u037e provided, however, that the foregoing\nshall not affect the right of any McAfee Stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such McAfee Stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a McAfee Stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal\nrights. Consequently, any McAfee Stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise\nthose rights.",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders\nand Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of Class A Common Stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to\nthe Merger. This discussion is limited to McAfee Stockholders who hold their shares of Class A Common Stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of\nSection 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the\n\u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any\ntime, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in\nthis discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax\nconsiderations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed below.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to McAfee Stockholders subject to special\nrules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:\n \n \n\u2022\n banks and other financial institutions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n mutual funds\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n insurance companies\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n dealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of Class A Common Stock (by vote\nor value)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds\u037e\n \n76Table of Contents\n \n\u2022\n holders that are holding shares of Class A Common Stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction or\nconversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n Partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS corporations,\u201d or any other pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n expatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n holders that are required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an\n\u201capplicable financial statement\u201d\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n persons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n except as noted below, holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of Class A Common\nStock (by vote or value)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n grantor trusts\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal\nincome tax\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n holders that received their shares of Class A Common Stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax qualified retirement plan or\npursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n holders that own a direct or indirect equity interest in Parent following the Merger\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n holders that hold their Class A Common Stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or\nresident outside the United States\u037e and\n \n \n\u2022\n holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and that properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other\nnon-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any\nconsiderations arising under the Medicare contribution tax or any considerations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account\nTax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection\ntherewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement). This summary does not describe any tax\nconsequences relating to the Exchange and Redemption.\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nbeneficial owner of shares of Class A Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the\nstatus of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in\npartnerships holding shares of Class A Common Stock should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR MCAFEE\nSTOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX\nADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN\nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.\n \n77\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cU.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of shares of Class A Common\nStock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n \n \n\u2022\n an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one (1) or more\n\u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust\nvalidly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount\nof cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Class A Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder\u2019s\nadjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Class A Common Stock. A U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss on the\ndisposition of shares of Class A Common Stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain\nor loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A preferential tax rate on\ncapital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is\nsubject to limitations. U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Class A Common Stock (shares of Class A Common Stock purchased or acquired on\ndifferent dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules apply to them.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cNon-U.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of Class A Common\nStock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSubject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in\nrespect of gain recognized in connection with the Merger, unless:\n \n \n\u2022\n the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in\nwhich case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S.\nHolder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income\ntax treaty)\u037e\n \n \n\u2022\n such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition of shares of\nClass A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to\nU.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S.\nsource capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder, provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to\nsuch losses\u037e or\n \n \n\u2022\n shares of Class A Common Stock constitute a United States real property interest (a \u201cUSRPI\u201d) by reason of the Company\u2019s status as a\n\u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes (\u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time during the shorter of the\nfive- year period preceding the\n \n78\nTable of Contents\n \neffective date of the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Class A Common Stock (the\n\u201cRelevant Period\u201d) and, if shares of our common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of\nSection 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any\ntime during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.\npersons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC\nif the fair market value of its USRPIs equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus\nits other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. For this purpose, USRPIs generally include land, improvements and associated\npersonal property. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any\ntime during the five-year period preceding the Merger. Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the\npossible consequences to them if we are a USRPHC.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders in connection with\nthe Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless\nthe U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct\ntaxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding of tax may also apply to the proceeds received by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the\nMerger, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s status as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable\ncertification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder generally\nwill be allowed as a credit against such holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL CHANGES OR\nINTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY\nWITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR\nTHE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION AND HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS\nREGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nGeneral\nMcAfee and Parent have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to comply with all\napplicable regulatory notification requirements, and, subject to certain limitations, to obtain regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and\nthe other transactions\n \n79Table of Contents\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include approval under the HSR Act, CFIUS Approval, the submission to DDTC of any\nrequired notifications under Section 122.4(b) of ITAR, and certain other applicable antitrust and foreign direct investment laws (whether domestic or\nforeign).\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until McAfee and Parent each files a Notification and\nReport Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the applicable waiting\nperiod has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting\nperiod following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or DOJ issues a request for additional information\nand documents (which we refer to as the \u201cSecond Request\u201d) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day\nwaiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is\nterminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.\nMcAfee and Parent each filed a Notification and Report Form with respect to the Merger with the FTC and DOJ on November 19, 2021. The\napplicable waiting period under the HSR Act expired on December 20, 2021.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the\nFTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate\nexisting relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any state could take such action under the antitrust\nlaws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We\ncannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties receive CFIUS Approval. McAfee and Parent submitted the Draft\nCFIUS Notice to CFIUS with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on December 1, 2021. CFIUS\nprovided comments to the Draft CFIUS Notice on December 13, 2021, and McAfee and Parent submitted a final joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with\nrespect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on December 23, 2021.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until at least 60 days have elapsed since McAfee submitted the notification to the\nDDTC pursuant to Section 122.4(b) of ITAR. McAfee submitted the notification to DDTC on November 20, 2021.\nAdditionally, the Merger is also subject to the filing or submission of, or obtaining of, certain necessary notices, clearances, approvals, waivers or\nconsents by the antitrust and other regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the Anti-Monopoly Law of China 2007 and SAMR Interim\nProvisions on the Review of Concentration of Undertakings of 2020 (The People\u2019s Republic of China), Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 on the\ncontrol of concentrations between undertakings (European Union), Swiss Federal Act on Cartels and Other Restrictions of Competition of 1995, as\namended, and Ordinance of the Control of Concentrations of Undertakings 1996, as amended (Switzerland), Turkish Law on Protection of Competition No.\n4054, as amended, and Communiqu\u00e9 No. 2010/4 on Mergers and Acquisitions Requiring the Approval of Competition Board (Turkey), Articles L. 151-1 et\nseq. and R. 151-1 et seq. of the French Monetary and Financial\n \n80\nTable of Contents\nCode as per last amendment on 31 December 2019 (D\u00e9cret no 2019-1590) (France), Italian Law Decree No. 21 of 15 March 2012, also referred to as the Law\non Golden Powers or Golden Powers Regulation (GPR), as per last amendment on 8 April 2020 (Decree No 23 of April 8, 2020) (Italy), Spanish Act on the\nlegal regime of capital movements and economic transactions abroad (the Act 19/2003) as per last amendment on 24 June 2021 (Royal Decree Law\n12/2021) (Spain), and UK National Security and Investment Act 2021 (United Kingdom). The Merger cannot be completed until McAfee and Parent obtain\nclearance to consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated in such jurisdictions. McAfee and Parent, in\nconsultation and cooperation with each other, made antitrust or other filings with the authorities of such jurisdictions.\n \n81\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Header": "Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement",
        "Section Text": "Amendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement\nThe following summary describes certain relevant provisions of the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the material provisions of the Amendment.\nThe descriptions of the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and\nare qualified in their entirety by reference to the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment, each of which is incorporated into this proxy\nstatement by reference. We encourage you to read the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment carefully and in their entirety because this\nsummary may not contain all the information about the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment that is important to you. The rights and\nobligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the TRA, the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Amendment and not by this summary or any\nother information contained in this proxy statement. \nConcurrent with the initial public offering of shares of the Class A Common Stock and related reorganization transactions undertaken in connection\nwith the initial public offering of McAfee, McAfee entered into a tax receivable agreement with the TRA beneficiaries. McAfee acquired favorable tax\nattributes as a result of the reorganization transactions. In addition, exchanges or redemptions of OpCo LLC units for cash or shares of Class A Common\nStock are expected to produce favorable tax attributes for McAfee. When McAfee acquires OpCo LLC units in connection with these exchanges or\nredemptions, anticipated tax basis adjustments are likely to increase (for tax purposes) McAfee\u2019s depreciation and amortization deductions, thereby\nreducing the amount of income tax that McAfee would be required to pay in the future in the absence of this increased basis. This increased tax basis\nmay also decrease the gain (or increase the loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent that the tax basis is allocated to those assets. Under\nthe terms of the TRA, absent a change of control of McAfee, McAfee would generally be required to pay to the TRA beneficiaries 85% of the benefits, if\nany, that McAfee is deemed to realize (calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of (i) all or a portion of McAfee\u2019s allocable share of existing tax\nbasis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) acquired in connection with the reorganization transactions undertaken in connection with\nMcAfee\u2019s initial public offering, (ii) increases in McAfee\u2019s allocable share of existing tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) and tax\nbasis\n \n110Table of Contents\nadjustments in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries) as a result of sales or exchanges of OpCo LLC units after McAfee\u2019s initial public offering,\n(iii) certain tax attributes of the corporations McAfee acquired in connection with such reorganization transactions (including their allocable share of\nexisting tax basis in the assets of OpCo LLC (and its subsidiaries)), and (iv) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax\nbenefits attributable to payments under the TRA. The increases in McAfee\u2019s allocable share of existing tax basis in OpCo LLC assets and tax basis\nadjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions available to members of OpCo LLC and,\ntherefore, may reduce the amount of tax that McAfee would otherwise be required to pay in the future in respect of taxable income and gain allocated to\nMcAfee with respect to OpCo LLC units.\nIn addition, the TRA provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control with respect to\nMcAfee were to occur, then the TRA would terminate and McAfee\u2019s obligations, or McAfee\u2019s successor\u2019s obligations, under the TRA would accelerate\nand become due and payable. Absent the Amendment, the amount of such accelerated change of control payment obligations would have been\ncalculated as aggregate payment obligations under the TRA absent a change of control based on certain assumptions set forth in the TRA, including\n(among others) the assumption that McAfee would have sufficient taxable income in each taxable year ending on or after the change of control to fully\nutilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA. The Merger, upon closing, constitutes a change of control under the TRA that would\ncause the payment obligations to accelerate and become due and payable.\nOn November 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their respective affiliates\nentered into the Amendment with certain other parties, in accordance with the terms of the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement. The Amendment (i)\namends the TRA and the OpCo LLC Agreement (as further described below) and (ii) provides for certain covenants regarding tax reporting and tax-related\nactions after the closing of the Merger.\nThe Amendment provides for (i) the payment of amounts due under the TRA with respect to McAfee\u2019s 2020 U.S. federal income tax year in\naccordance with the terms of the TRA up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000, which payments shall be paid no later than 10 business days prior to the\nClosing Date, (ii) the suspension of all other payments under the TRA from and after November 5, 2021 and (iii) the amendment of the TRA by inserting a\nnew Section 7.19 into the TRA effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time which will result in the TRA\n(and all of McAfee\u2019s payment obligations thereunder, including the obligation to make any of the foregoing suspended payments) terminating\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time. The Amendment also includes agreements among the parties thereto regarding the preparation of tax returns for\ntax periods that end on, before or include the Closing Date and limits actions that may be taken by McAfee, OpCo LLC and certain of their controlled\naffiliates after the closing of the Merger to the extent such actions may have an effect on items reflected on such tax returns.\nThe Amendment also (i) suspends all tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement from and after November 5, 2021 for so long as the\nAmendment is in effect, and (ii) provides that from and after the Effective Time, no person or entity shall have any obligation to make or pay tax\ndistributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement.\nIn the event the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Amendment shall become null and void ab initio and all\npayments that were suspended under the TRA pursuant to the Amendment, and all tax distributions that were suspended under the OpCo LLC\nAgreement pursuant to the Amendment, shall be made by McAfee and OpCo LLC as if the Amendment had never been executed.\nThe Amendment will result in (i) the suspension of certain payments under the TRA with respect to McAfee\u2019s 2021 U.S. federal income tax year in\naggregate and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement, a permanent elimination of certain payments under\nthe TRA that\n \n111\nTable of Contents\nwould have otherwise been payable to the TRA beneficiaries under the TRA with respect to McAfee\u2019s 2021 U.S. federal income tax year. The Amendment\nwill also eliminate any obligation of McAfee to make a payment under the TRA as a result of a change of control of McAfee, which would be substantial.\nThe Amendment also will result in (i) the suspension of certain tax distributions by OpCo LLC under the OpCo LLC Agreement with respect to McAfee\u2019s\n2021 and 2022 U.S. federal income tax years and (ii) contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement, a permanent\nelimination of an obligation to make such tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement. Tax distributions under the OpCo LLC Agreement are\nintended to be sufficient to cover OpCo LLC members\u2019 respective U.S. federal, state and local income tax liability (as determined in accordance with the\nOpCo LLC Agreement). Such tax liability relates to the net amount of taxable income and gain allocated to such members for the relevant taxable period\n(or as a result of any capital shifts or guaranteed payments for the use of capital) with respect to OpCo LLC units held by such members. The suspension\nand/or elimination of tax distributions under the Amendment will reduce the outflow of cash from OpCo LLC to members of the OpCo LLC each quarter\nduring the period that the Amendment is in effect.\nFor more information with respect to the Amendment, please see our other filings with the SEC, including the section in our 2021 Proxy Statement\ncaptioned \u201cAmendment to Tax Receivable Agreement and OpCo LLC Agreement\u201d above and a copy of the Amendment which is included as Exhibit 99.2\nto McAfee\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on November 8, 2021. A copy of the TRA is included as Exhibit 10.2 to McAfee\u2019s Current Report on Form\n8-K, filed on October 26, 2020, and a copy of the OpCo LLC Agreement is included as Exhibit 10.1 to McAfee\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on\nOctober 26, 2020.
