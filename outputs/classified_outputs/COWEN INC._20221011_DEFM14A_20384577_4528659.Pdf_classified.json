As of the close of business on the record date, there were\n28,014,299 shares of class A common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each such stockholder is entitled\nto one vote per share of class A common stock held by such stockholder on the record date on each of the\nproposals presented in this proxy statement. Holders of shares of class B common stock and holders of shares\nof preferred stock of the Company are not entitled to vote on the merger proposal, the advisory compensation\nproposal or the adjournment proposal.\nIf on September 29, 2022, you were a \u201crecord\u201d holder of class A common stock (that is, if you held class A\ncommon stock in your own name in the stock register maintained by our transfer agent, Computershare), you are\nentitled to vote at the virtual special meeting or by proxy. Whether or not you intend to attend the virtual special\nmeeting, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote now, online, by phone or by proxy card to ensure that\nyour vote is counted.\nIf on September 29, 2022, you were the beneficial owner of class A common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d (that\nis, if you held class A common stock through your broker), then these materials are being\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nforwarded to you by your broker. You may direct your broker how to vote your class A common stock by\nfollowing the voting instructions on the form provided by your broker. If you hold any class A common stock\nthrough your broker and wish to attend the virtual special meeting, you may attend the virtual special meeting\nbut may not be able to vote unless you first obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from your broker or other\nnominee. The cut-off time for submitting a legal proxy is November 14, 2022 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.\nQ:\nWhat proposals will be considered at the special meeting?\nA:\nAt the special meeting, Cowen stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\n\u2022\na proposal to adopt the merger agreement (the \u201cmerger proposal\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\na proposal to approve, by advisory (non-binding) vote, the compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to our named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the merger (the \u201cadvisory\ncompensation proposal\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\na proposal to approve any adjournment of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional\nproxies if there are insufficient votes at the special meeting to approve the merger proposal (the\n\u201cadjournment proposal\u201d).\nQ:\nWhat constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?\nA:\nThe presence in person or by proxy of any number of stockholders, together holding at least a majority of the\ncapital stock of Cowen issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a\nquorum for purposes of the special meeting. Virtual attendance at the special meeting constitutes presence in\nperson for quorum purposes at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special\nmeeting. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a\nquorum.\nIf a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the Cowen stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting,\npresent virtually or by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting. The adjourned meeting may take place without\nfurther notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting (subject to certain restrictions in the\nmerger agreement, including that the special meeting generally may not be held, without TD\u2019s consent, on a date\nthat is more than seven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment or postponement or more\nthan twenty (20) business days in the aggregate after the date on which the special meeting was originally\nscheduled). In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, or if there are insufficient votes to\napprove the merger proposal at the time of the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be\npostponed or adjourned to solicit additional proxies.\nQ:\nWhat vote of our stockholders is required to approve each of the proposals?\nA:\nThe approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common\nstock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt\nof such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the\nmerger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice\nversa. Abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Cowen stockholder\u2019s\nbehalf) will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of\nclass A common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special\nmeeting. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock, to\nvote at the virtual special meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the\noutcome of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the\nnumber of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the advisory compensation\nproposal.\nThe approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A\ncommon stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting.\nAssuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock, to\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nvote at the virtual special meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will have no effect on the\noutcome of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the\nnumber of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against the adjournment proposal.\nThe Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if the merger proposal is approved at the special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe Board unanimously recommends a vote \u201cFOR\u201d the merger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the advisory compensation\nproposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to unanimously recommend the\napproval of the merger proposal, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Reasons for the Merger\u201d beginning on\npage 53 of this proxy statement.\nQ:\nHow do the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers intend to vote?\nA:\nAs of September 29, 2022, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned in the\naggregate 1,858,433 shares of common stock, or approximately 6.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock.\nAlthough none of the directors or executive officers is obligated to vote to approve the merger proposal, we\ncurrently expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares in favor of each of the proposals\nto be presented at the special meeting.\nQ:\nDo any of the Company\u2019s directors or executive officers have any interests in the merger that are different\nfrom, or in addition to, my interests as a Company stockholder?\nA:\nIn considering the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting, you should be aware that the Company\u2019s\ndirectors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,\nyour interests as a Company stockholder. The members of the Board were aware of and considered these\ninterests in reaching the determination to approve the merger proposal and unanimously recommend that\nCompany stockholders approve the merger proposal. These interests may include:\n\u2022\nthe treatment of Company equity awards (as described below in \u201cThe Merger-Treatment of Compensation\nAwards for Directors and Executive Officers\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain compensation arrangements pursuant to new employment agreements between executive officers\nand Parent, which will be effective on, and contingent upon, the closing of the merger, including severance\nand other benefits in the case of certain qualifying terminations and one-time cash-based retention or\nintegration bonuses\u037e and\n\u2022\ncontinued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement, the Company\u2019s\norganizational documents and indemnification agreements the Company has entered into with each of its\ndirectors and executive officers.\nThese interests are described in more detail, and certain of them are quantified, in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 70 of this\nproxy statement.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I transfer my class A common stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you own class A\ncommon stock on the record date but transfer your shares of class A common stock after the record date but\nprior to the special meeting, you will retain your right to vote such shares of class A common stock at the special\nmeeting. However, the right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person to whom you transferred\nyour shares of class A common stock.\nQ:\nHow do I vote if I am a Cowen stockholder of record?\nA:\nIf you are a Cowen stockholder of record, you may vote in advance by authorizing a proxy for the special\nmeeting via the internet, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card in\nthe envelope provided. In order to submit a vote by proxy via the internet or telephone, follow the applicable\ninstructions shown on the proxy card mailed to you. You may also vote by attending the virtual special meeting\nand voting during the live webcast.\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nFor more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, see the section entitled \u201cThe Special\nMeeting-Voting Procedures\u201d beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the virtual special meeting, we urge you to vote now to ensure your vote is\ncounted. You may still attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast if you have already\nvoted by proxy.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if abstain from voting or fail to vote on any of the proposals?\nA:\nThe approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of class A common\nstock outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter. Under Delaware law and the merger agreement, the receipt\nof such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the merger. Note that you may vote to approve the\nmerger proposal and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal or adjournment proposal and vice\nversa. Abstentions or failures to vote (including a failure to authorize a proxy to vote on a Cowen stockholder\u2019s\nbehalf) will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.\nThe approval of the advisory compensation and the adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of\nthe majority of shares of class A common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such\nproposal at the special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, if you fail to authorize a proxy to vote your\nshares of common stock, to vote at the virtual special meeting, or to instruct your broker on how to vote, it will\nhave no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted as shares present for the\npurposes of determining the number of votes required, and therefore will have the same effect as a vote against\nthese proposals.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?\nA:\nYes. For Cowen stockholders of record, any time after you have submitted a proxy card and before the proxy\ncard is exercised, you may revoke or change your vote in one of three ways:\n\u2022\nYou may submit a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy or\nvoting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail.\n\u2022\nYou may submit a written notice of revocation to the Company\u2019s Secretary at 599 Lexington Avenue, New\nYork, NY 10022.\n\u2022\nYou may attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the live webcast. Attendance at the virtual\nspecial meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously granted proxy.\nPlease note that if you want to revoke your proxy by sending a new proxy card or a written notice of revocation\nto the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in\nsufficient time for it to be received by the Company prior to the special meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d, you will need to revoke or resubmit your proxy through your broker\nand in accordance with its procedures. If your broker allows you to submit a proxy via the internet or by\ntelephone, you may be able to change your vote by submitting a new proxy via the internet or by telephone (or\nby mail). In order to attend the virtual special meeting and vote during the webcast, you will need to obtain a\nproxy from your broker, the Cowen stockholder of record.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement or\nmultiple proxy or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your common stock in more than one\nbrokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you\nhold common stock. Please submit each proxy and voting instruction card that you receive to ensure that all of\nyour shares of common stock are voted.\n18\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nIf I hold my common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?\nA:\nNo. Promptly after the effective time, and in any event not later than the fifth business day after the effective\ntime, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of common stock entitled to the merger\nconsideration a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such Cowen stockholder how to surrender its\ncommon stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Each holder of common stock will be entitled to receive\nthe merger consideration upon the surrender of such certificate for cancelation to the paying agent together with\nthe associated letter of transmittal, duly completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions\nthereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the paying agent. You should not return\nyour stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the\npaying agent without a letter of transmittal. If you hold common stock in non-certificated book-entry form, you\nwill not be required to deliver a stock certificate, and you will instead receive your cash payment after the paying\nagent receives the documents requested in the applicable instruction.\nQ:\nAm I entitled to exercise appraisal rights, dissenters\u2019 rights or the rights of an objecting stockholder?\nA:\nAs a general matter, holders of common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement\nand the approval of the merger and otherwise comply with the requirements of Delaware law will be entitled to\ndissenters\u2019 appraisal rights to receive the statutorily determined \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of capital stock of\nthe Company. You should read the section entitled \u201cAppraisal Rights\u201d beginning on page 120 of this proxy\nstatement and Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the\nfollowing publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262, for a more\ncomplete discussion of dissenters\u2019 appraisal rights. Holders of shares of preferred stock of the Company will\nalso be entitled to dissenters\u2019 appraisal rights to receive the statutorily determined \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of\ncapital stock of the Company.\nQ:\nWhen is the merger expected to be consummated?\nA:\nWe currently expect to consummate the merger during the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to receipt of the\nCowen stockholder approval and the required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the other\nconditions to the merger described in the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat effect will the merger have on the Company?\nA:\nIf the merger is consummated, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will\ncontinue to exist following the merger as a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Parent. If the merger is\nconsummated, the class A common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and deregistered\nunder the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time, and, accordingly, the\nclass A common stock will no longer be publicly traded.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not consummated?\nA:\nIn the event that the Cowen stockholder approval is not obtained or if the merger is not consummated for any\nother reason, Cowen stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection\nwith the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the class A common stock\nwill continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the class A common stock will\ncontinue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company\u2019s stockholders will continue to own their\nshares of common stock and will continue to be subject to the same general risks and opportunities as they\ncurrently are with respect to ownership of the common stock.\nUnder certain circumstances, Cowen will be required to pay TD a termination fee equal to $42,250,000.00 in cash\nand, under certain other circumstances, TD will be required to pay Cowen an expense reimbursement including\n(i) $10,000,000 for fees and expenses of third party advisors and other transaction costs, (ii) the aggregate face\namount of employee retention awards which have been allocated and communicated to employees of Cowen\n(subject to certain limitations and requirements) and (iii) the designated capped amount for the premium of an\ninsurance policy that may, at the request of TD, be bound by Cowen pursuant to the merger agreement. For\nmore information, see the sections \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-\nExpense Reimbursement\u201d beginning on pages 111 and 112, respectively, of this proxy statement.\n19\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat is householding and how does it affect me?\nA:\nThe SEC has approved rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery\nrequirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more Cowen stockholders sharing\nthe same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those Cowen stockholders. This process,\nwhich is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding\u201d, potentially means extra convenience for Cowen stockholders\nand cost savings for companies.\nBrokers with account holders who are Cowen stockholders of the Company may be \u201chouseholding\u201d proxy\nmaterials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple Cowen stockholders sharing an address unless\ncontrary instructions have been received from the affected Cowen stockholders. If you have received notice\nfrom your broker that they will be \u201chouseholding\u201d communications to your address, such \u201chouseholding\u201d will\ncontinue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to\nparticipate in \u201chouseholding\u201d and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker\nand direct your written request to Cowen Inc., Attention: Investor Relations Department, 599 Lexington Avenue,\nNew York, NY 10022. Cowen stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their\naddress and would like to request \u201chouseholding\u201d of their communications should contact their broker.\nQ:\nWho can help answer my questions?\nA:\nIf you need assistance in completing your proxy card or have questions regarding the special meeting, please\ncontact Alliance Advisors LLC, which is acting as the Company\u2019s proxy solicitation agent in connection with\nthe merger, toll free at (855) 935-2549.\nAlliance Advisors, LLC\n200 Broadacres Drive, 3rd Floor, Bloomfield, NJ 07003\n(855) 935-2549\nCOWN@allianceadvisors.com\n20\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

These reviews\nhave included consideration, from time to time, of potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions\nto enhance stockholder value, including potential sale transactions. Such reviews have been accompanied by\nperiodic conversations between senior executives of the Company and their counterparts at other companies in the\nfinancial services industry regarding such potential transactions and opportunities.\nOn January 19, 2022, Mr. Riaz Ahmed, TD\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, TD Securities and Group Head,\nWholesale Banking, contacted Mr. Jeffrey Solomon, the Company\u2019s Chair and Chief Executive Officer, to request a\nmeeting with Mr. Solomon. An introductory meeting between Mr. Solomon, Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Robbie Pryde, TD\nSecurities\u2019 Executive Vice Chair and Head of Corporate and Investment Banking, took place on March 1, 2022, at\nwhich they discussed their respective businesses. During such conversation, representatives of TD indicated an\ninterest in expanding TD\u2019s investment banking business in the U.S. Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Brett Barth, the\nBoard\u2019s lead independent director, of the March 1 meeting (and the earlier January call) shortly thereafter.\nOn March 2, 2022, Mr. Solomon contacted Mr. Ahmed to inform Mr. Ahmed that, following the March 1 meeting and\ninternal discussions, the Company would be interested in continuing the conversation regarding their respective\nbusinesses and potential opportunities for the Company and TD to consider.\nOn March 9, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Ahmed had a call to continue their conversation regarding their respective\nbusinesses and potential opportunities for the Company and TD to consider.\nAlso on March 9, 2022, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the securities business of Company A, a global\nfinancial institution, representatives of which had, from time to time, expressed interest in business opportunities with\nthe Company, contacted a representative of Ardea, a financial advisor to the Company, to inquire, based on Ardea\u2019s\nfamiliarity with the Company, whether Ardea was aware whether the Company might be interested in engaging in a\npotential strategic partnership with Company A. The representative of Ardea encouraged the representative of\nCompany A to contact the Company directly if Company A was interested in pursuing discussions with the\nCompany. The representative of Company A then contacted Mr. Solomon to schedule a meeting to discuss the\npotential for a strategic partnership between the Company and Company A. On March 17, 2022, Mr. Solomon met\nwith a representative of Company A. During this meeting, Mr. Solomon and the representative of Company A\ndiscussed their respective businesses. Following this meeting, on March 21, 2022, the representative of Company A\ncontacted Mr. Solomon to request a follow-up meeting with additional members of management of the Company and\nof Company A. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Barth of the inquiry from Company A, the March 17\nmeeting, and the March 21 request for a follow-up meeting.\nOn April 5, 2022, representatives of the Company including Mr. Solomon, Mr. Dan Charney, Managing Director and\nCo-President of the Company\u2019s broker-dealer business, and Mr. Larry Wieseneck, Managing Director and Co-\nPresident of the Company\u2019s broker-dealer business, met with Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Pryde. A representative of Perkins\nAdvisors, LLC, a financial advisor to the Company (which we refer to as \u201cPerkins Advisors\u201d), also attended at the\nrequest of the Company\u2019s management. During this meeting, management of the Company and of TD discussed their\nrespective businesses, including a potential strategic partnership between TD and the Company.\nOn April 12, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Stephen Lasota, the Company\u2019s Managing Director and Chief Financial\nOfficer, met with representatives of Company A to discuss their respective businesses, including the\n31TABLE OF CONTENTS\ngrowth of the research, sales and trading and investment banking divisions at Cowen, the alignment of Cowen\u2019s\nculture with the culture at TD and the potential for a strategic partnership between Company A and the Company. A\nrepresentative of Perkins Advisors also attended at the request of the Company\u2019s management.\nDuring the week of April 18, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Ahmed spoke on several occasions, during which Mr.\nAhmed informed Mr. Solomon that TD had enjoyed their prior introductory meeting and wanted to continue\nconversations regarding a potential strategic partnership between TD and the Company. Mr. Ahmed proposed a\nfollow-up meeting between management of the Company and of TD to discuss their respective businesses further,\nand Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Ahmed that he would discuss any further engagement with the Board at its upcoming\nmeeting.\nOn April 21, 2022, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in person. During executive session, Mr. Solomon\ninformed the independent directors of the Board (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d) of\nthe interest from TD and Company A in exploring potential strategic partnerships with the Company. The Board also\nnoted that other parties had, from time to time, expressed interest in a potential strategic transaction involving the\nCompany. After discussion, the Board authorized Mr. Solomon to engage in discussions with TD, Company A and\nother parties that express interest regarding their respective interests in and the basic terms of a potential strategic\ntransaction. The Board instructed Mr. Solomon not to discuss the terms of any proposal relating to compensation or\nretention arrangements for members of management until after the Board and a potential acquiror had reached an\nagreement on the price per share of common stock of the Company to be paid in a potential strategic transaction.\nLater on April 21, 2022, TD sent the Company a draft mutual confidentiality agreement.\nOn April 22, 2022, the Company and TD entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement which contained a customary\nstandstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a binding written\nagreement for the acquisition of the Company by a third party.\nOn April 28, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with Mr. Ahmed. During this meeting, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Ahmed discussed the\npotential strategic fit of the Company and TD, including the cultural fit and potential social issues associated with\ncombining the two organizations and their respective employees. Following this discussion, Mr. Solomon and Mr.\nAhmed agreed to schedule a meeting between the broader management teams of the Company and TD.\nOn May 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (which we refer to as \u201cCravath\u201d), outside counsel to the Company,\nattending. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent Directors on discussions with TD regarding a\npotential strategic transaction, noting that TD continued to show interest in a potential transaction involving the\nCompany and that the Company and TD had scheduled a meeting between their respective management teams to\nreview management presentations during the following week. Mr. Solomon also noted that the Company\u2019s\nmanagement was planning a meeting with Company A in the coming weeks to continue a review of their respective\nbusinesses and to evaluate a potential strategic transaction with Company A. Representatives of Cravath then\nreviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties and other legal matters. Representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s management then reviewed with the Board the Company\u2019s existing financial forecasts, including a \u201cbase\ncase\u201d based on the Company\u2019s existing internal plan for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 extended through fiscal year 2026\nand a \u201chigh case\u201d for the same period reflecting assumptions regarding an improved macroeconomic environment,\nincreased activity in the Company\u2019s core businesses and accelerated growth in the Company\u2019s growth businesses\n(including the Company\u2019s Cowen Digital businesses). Representatives of the Company\u2019s management also reviewed\nwith the Board the potential impact of certain potential divestitures on the Company\u2019s financial forecasts. The Board\nthen discussed the Company\u2019s actual results to date during the second quarter of 2022. The Company\u2019s management\nnoted that, given the adverse macroeconomic environment, including a broader decline in equity markets and deal-\nmaking activity and rising interest rates during the quarter, actual revenue for the fiscal year 2022 across all core\nbusinesses was expected to be lower than the \u201cbase case\u201d for fiscal year 2022. After discussion, the Independent\nDirectors requested management to present its \u201clow case\u201d forecast reflecting the then-current market environment.\nMr. Solomon noted that the Company\u2019s management had prepared such a forecast for budgeting purposes for the\n2022 fiscal year but had not previously extended such forecast beyond fiscal year 2022. The Independent Directors\nrequested that the Company\u2019s management extend such forecast through fiscal year 2026 and present such forecast\nat a subsequent Board meeting.\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn May 10, 2022, representatives of management of the Company and of TD met to review management\npresentations regarding their respective businesses. A representative of Perkins Advisors also attended at the\nrequest of the Company\u2019s management. The Company\u2019s management presentation included the Company\u2019s \u201cBase\nCase\u201d and \u201cHigh Case\u201d financial forecasts for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, which the Independent Directors had\nauthorized the Company\u2019s management to share with TD upon Mr. Solomon\u2019s request following the May 6 Board\nmeeting. The Company also provided TD with a summary of \u201cchange of control\u201d severance payments that could\npotentially become payable to all Company employees entitled to such payments in connection with a qualifying\ntermination following a \u201cchange of control\u201d, which the Company estimated, based on an assumed closing of a\ntransaction on September 30, 2022, to be equivalent to an aggregate amount of approximately $305 million\n(approximately $67 million of which was estimated to be attributable to pro rata bonuses). In addition, for all\nemployees with \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements, the Company estimated that there would be accelerated\nvesting of an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million shares of class A common stock in respect of Company RSUs\nand Company PSUs and approximately $17 million of deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards\npreviously granted in respect of prior years\u2019 compensation (assuming termination of employment for all such\nemployees without cause in connection with a \u201cchange of control\u201d on September 30, 2022). Such amounts included\nan estimated aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $294 million of such payments (approximately $65\nmillion of which was estimated to be attributable to pro rata bonuses) and accelerated vesting of an aggregate of\napproximately 1.5 million shares of class A common stock in respect of Company RSUs and Company PSUs and an\nestimated amount of approximately $17 million of deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards previously\ngranted in respect of prior years\u2019 compensation. Such amounts included, for Messrs. Charney and Wieseneck\ncombined, an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $144 million of such payments (approximately $32 million\nof which was estimated to be attributable to pro rata bonuses) and accelerated vesting of an aggregate of\napproximately 0.7 million shares of class A common stock in respect of Company RSUs and Company PSUs and an\nestimated amount of approximately $5.5 million of deferred cash underlying deferred compensation awards previously\ngranted in respect of prior years\u2019 compensation. During this meeting, representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand Perkins Advisors indicated to the representatives of TD that any indication of interest with respect to a potential\ntransaction involving TD and the Company should be based on the Company\u2019s intrinsic value (also taking into\naccount the value of the Company\u2019s investment management business and balance sheet investments) and should\nnot be based on the then-current trading price of the class A common stock, which was $24.30 as of May 9, 2022, the\nlast trading day before such meeting.\nFollowing this meeting, representatives of TD informed representatives of the Company\u2019s management that TD was\ninterested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company, and that TD would provide an initial indication of the\nvaluation of such an acquisition by the end of the following week. Representatives of TD also noted that TD would\nintend to keep the Company\u2019s management team involved in the business after a potential acquisition though no\nterms of compensation, titles or responsibilities of members of the Company\u2019s management team were discussed. Mr.\nSolomon informed representatives of TD that, while the Company was not seeking a sale of the Company at that time\nand that he did not expect the Board would be willing to pursue a sale of the Company at a valuation based on the\nthen-current trading price of the class A common stock, which had fallen from $31.86 at the close of trading on\nJanuary 19, 2022 (the date TD first contacted the Company to request a meeting) to $23.87 at the close of trading on\nMay 10, 2022, the Company would evaluate any acquisition proposal with the Board.\nOn May 11, 2022, the Company sent Company A a draft mutual confidentiality agreement.\nLater on May 11, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with Mr. Bharat Masrani, TD\u2019s Group President and Chief Executive Officer,\nto further discuss a potential strategic transaction between the Company and TD. Mr. Masrani informed Mr. Solomon\nthat TD was interested in expanding its broker-dealer business in the U.S., and that TD believed that an acquisition of\nCowen would further that strategy given the Company\u2019s strong business and cultural fit with TD.\nOn May 12, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Cravath and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent\nDirectors on the discussions with TD, noting that TD had expressed strong interest in a potential transaction and\nthat management expected TD to provide an indication of the valuation of a potential acquisition of the Company by\nthe\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nend of the following week. Mr. Solomon also informed the Board that a meeting was being scheduled with Company\nA in the coming weeks to facilitate Company A\u2019s continued review of the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s\nmanagement then reviewed with the Board updated preliminary financial forecasts for fiscal years 2022 through 2026,\nincluding a \u201clow case\u201d, \u201cbase case\u201d and \u201chigh case\u201d as requested by the Board on May 10, 2022, including key\nassumptions underlying each scenario. After discussion of the preliminary financial forecasts, the Board instructed\nmanagement to share such preliminary financial forecasts with Ardea and to continue refining such preliminary\nfinancial forecasts. The Board had selected Ardea as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement. In selecting Ardea as a financial advisor, the Board also considered Ardea\u2019s substantial\nindustry knowledge and familiarity with the Company\u2019s businesses. The Independent Directors also discussed with\nmanagement whether any parties other than TD and Company A had expressed interest in a potential strategic\ntransaction involving the Company. Mr. Solomon noted that, while certain other parties had in the past expressed\ninformal interest in a potential strategic transaction involving the Company, such inquiries had not been recent and\nhad not led to any substantive discussions. The Independent Directors determined that, given the potential\ndisruption to the Company\u2019s business of a potential public leak, it was advisable that the Company and its\nrepresentatives not contact any other potential counterparties at that time, but for the Company\u2019s management to\ncontinue engaging with TD and Company A and any other party that expressed interest in a potential strategic\ntransaction involving the Company. The Independent Directors also requested that the Company\u2019s management and\nArdea review with the Independent Directors a list of other potentially interested parties and the likelihood that such\nparties would be able to execute a strategic transaction involving the Company at a subsequent meeting of the Board.\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company and Company A entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement which contained a\ncustomary standstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a binding\ndefinitive written agreement for the acquisition of the Company by a third party.\nOn May 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Cravath and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent\nDirectors on the discussions with TD and Company A, noting that management continued to expect TD to provide\nan indication of the value of a potential acquisition of the Company within the next week, and that management was\ncontinuing to provide information to facilitate diligence to TD and, now that Company A had signed a confidentiality\nagreement, Company A. The Board instructed management to continue discussions and continue sharing diligence\ninformation with TD and Company A. The Company\u2019s management then reviewed again with the Board the financial\nforecasts reviewed with the Board on May 6, 2022, and also reviewed with the Board updated financial forecasts for\nfiscal years 2024 through 2026, including a \u201cLow Case\u201d, \u201cBase Case\u201d and \u201cHigh Case\u201d for fiscal years 2022 through\n2026, which forecasts we refer to collectively as the \u201cFinancial Forecasts\u201d and are described in more detail in the\nsection entitled \u201cThe Merger-Financial Forecasts\u201d beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, including key\nassumptions underlying each scenario and the Company\u2019s results to date during the second quarter of 2022. A\ndiscussion followed regarding macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets, the impact\nof such conditions and markets on the Company\u2019s business and financial prospects and the trading price of the class\nA common stock, and the risks associated with remaining a standalone public company in such an environment,\nincluding the potential impact of a downturn on the Company\u2019s profitability and therefore its ability to compensate\nand retain employees. The Board also discussed the relative probability of each of the scenarios reflected in the\nFinancial Forecasts in light of such macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets,\nnoting that the \u201cHigh Case\u201d was unlikely to be achieved, but did not assign any formal probabilities at that time. The\nBoard also discussed the Company\u2019s potential divestiture of certain of the Company\u2019s assets, noting that several\nparties had expressed interest in exploring potential transactions involving some or all of such assets, but that the\nCompany had not received any formal indications of interest for a specific proposal involving such assets. The Board\nfurther noted that the likelihood of executing any such divestitures in the immediate future was low given the\nmacroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets, and therefore that any valuation for the\nCompany should assume that the Company retains all of its businesses. After discussion, the Board authorized the\nCompany\u2019s management to share the Financial Forecasts with Ardea and requested that Ardea prepare preliminary\nfinancial analyses for the Company on a standalone basis.\nOver the following weeks, both TD and Company A conducted preliminary due diligence, including numerous calls\nand meetings with the Company\u2019s management and review of documentary diligence materials,\n34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nincluding copies of the Company\u2019s \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements, summaries of which had been\nprovided to TD on May 10, 2022. Mr. Solomon and other members of the Company\u2019s senior management and\nadvisors periodically briefed and received input from the Independent Directors as to the due diligence processes\nwith TD and Company A.\nOn May 19, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (which we refer to as \u201cSimpson Thacher\u201d),\noutside counsel to TD, contacted representatives of Cravath and communicated that, while TD was considering a\nproposal for an acquisition of the Company, TD would not be willing to pursue a transaction without restructuring\nand reducing the Company\u2019s existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance obligations that would otherwise become\npayable in connection with a transaction. After discussion with Mr. Barth and representatives of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement team, representatives of Cravath communicated to representatives of Simpson Thacher a request that\nany proposal should include the proposed price to be paid per share of class A common stock in a potential\ntransaction and, in order for the Board to assess whether any proposal were actionable, TD\u2019s proposal regarding\nrestructuring or reducing the Company\u2019s \u201cchange of control\u201d severance obligations.\nOn May 26, 2022, Mr. Solomon and Mr. Lasota, together with a representative from Perkins Advisors, met with a\nrepresentative of Company A to continue a discussion of their respective businesses and a potential strategic\npartnership between the two companies, including a review of the Company\u2019s \u201cBase Case\u201d and \u201cHigh Case\u201d\nforecasts for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\nLater on May 26, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon to inform Mr. Solomon that TD\u2019s advisors would be\ncommunicating a non-binding proposal for an acquisition of all of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock later\nthat day. Subsequently, a representative of Perella Weinberg Partners (which we refer to as \u201cPerella Weinberg\u201d)\nverbally communicated to a representative of Ardea TD\u2019s non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding\ncommon stock for $32.00 in cash per share of common stock (which we refer to as the \u201cMay 26 Proposal\u201d), which\nproposal represented a 25% premium to the closing trading price for shares of class A common stock of $25.70 on\nMay 25, 2022, the last trading day prior to the May 26 Proposal. The representative of Perella Weinberg also\ncommunicated that the May 26 Proposal was conditioned upon TD reaching satisfactory arrangements with all\nmembers of the Company\u2019s management team with \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements (including the\nExecutives) requiring such members to waive their \u201cgood reason\u201d resignation rights and \u201cchange of control\u201d\nseverance protections in connection with the potential transaction in exchange for retention awards that would vest\nover a three-year period after the closing of the potential transaction with a face value representing a substantial\nreduction compared to the aggregate estimated cash severance payable to such members of management under their\nexisting contractual severance entitlements (with the proposed discount to such entitlements based primarily on a\nreduction of the underlying multiples of prior years\u2019 compensation used to determine the amounts of cash severance\npayable from 2.5x of total compensation under the existing contractual arrangements to 1.5x to 2.0x of cash\ncompensation (i.e., base salary and cash bonus), varying by individual).\nArdea communicated the May 26 Proposal, including the proposed reduction of the aggregate estimated value of the\ncash severance payable to members of management, to Mr. Barth and Mr. Solomon, as well as representatives of\nCravath and Perkins Advisors. After discussion among Mr. Barth, the Company\u2019s senior management and\nrepresentatives of Ardea, Perkins Advisors and Cravath, it was determined that the May 26 Proposal undervalued the\nCompany and was likely below a valuation that the Board would be willing to consider for a sale of the Company. Mr.\nSolomon updated each of the Independent Directors on the May 26 Proposal and informed them that Mr. Solomon\nand the Company\u2019s management team recommended ceasing further engagement unless the proposed price of $32.00\nin cash per share of common stock reflected in the May 26 Proposal was improved substantially.\nOn May 30, 2022, a representative of Ardea, acting upon the instructions of the Company, communicated to a\nrepresentative of Perella Weinberg that the May 26 Proposal undervalued the Company and that the Company would\nnot be engaging in any further discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction.\nOn May 31, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon. Mr. Solomon reiterated that the valuation of the May 26\nProposal did not warrant further discussion. Mr. Ahmed informed Mr. Solomon that TD would conduct further\ndiligence and valuation analysis prior to submitting a revised proposal. Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Barth of the\ndiscussion.\nDuring the remainder of the week of May 30, 2022, TD continued due diligence, including due diligence meetings and\ncalls on June 2, 2022, June 3, 2022 and June 4, 2022 between representatives of management of\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTD and of the Company to discuss the potential sources of value in the Company\u2019s business outside of the\nCompany\u2019s core investment banking and broker-dealer franchise (including the value of the Company\u2019s investment\nmanagement business and balance sheet investments). Representatives of Perella Weinberg and Perkins Advisors\nalso participated in the due diligence meetings and calls.\nOn June 5, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon and verbally communicated to Mr. Solomon TD\u2019s revised non-\nbinding proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock for $39.00 in cash per share of common stock\n(which we refer to as the \u201cJune 5 Proposal\u201d), which proposal represented a 49% premium to the closing price for\nshares of class A common stock of $26.18 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 5 Proposal. The June\n5 Proposal contained the same conditionality as the May 26 Proposal, including TD reaching satisfactory\narrangements with each member of the Company\u2019s management team with \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements.\nMr. Solomon informed Mr. Ahmed that he would need to discuss the revised proposal with the Board. A\nrepresentative of Perella Weinberg also contacted a representative of Ardea and verbally communicated the June 5\nProposal later that day, and noted that the additional due diligence and analysis of the Company\u2019s investment\nmanagement business had enabled TD to increase its proposal from the May 26 Proposal.\nOn June 6, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with members of the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of Cravath, Ardea and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Solomon communicated the June 5 Proposal\nto the Independent Directors, and Mr. Solomon and representatives of Ardea described to the Independent Directors\ntheir respective conversations with TD and its advisors. The Board then discussed a potential response to the June 5\nProposal, noting that the June 5 Proposal had been communicated verbally and did not include a description of any\ncontingencies to the proposal or any further details on the May 26 Proposal with respect to retention arrangements\nwith members of the Company\u2019s senior management team in lieu of \u201cchange of control\u201d payments, and that while\nCompany A was continuing to conduct due diligence, Company A had not yet submitted an indication of interest.\nRepresentatives of Ardea noted that Ardea was reviewing the Financial Forecasts with the Company\u2019s management,\nincluding reconciling economic operating income to unlevered free cash flow for purposes of a preliminary valuation\nanalysis, and that Ardea would prepare preliminary financial analyses of the June 5 Proposal for discussion at a\nsubsequent meeting of the Board. After discussion the Board determined to continue evaluating the June 5 Proposal,\nbut not to request a written proposal from TD at that time. The Board then discussed whether any other third party\nmay be interested in an acquisition of the Company, including Ardea\u2019s views on potential bidders based on Ardea\u2019s\nknowledge of the industry and information from management on third parties that had previously expressed interest\nin partnerships or other strategic transactions involving the Company. After discussion, the Board determined that\nthere was a limited number of counterparties that may be interested in and able to execute an acquisition of the\nCompany, and that given the risk of a leak and the potential damage to the Company\u2019s business and employee\nretention in the event of a leak, it was advisable to continue discussions with TD and Company A but not to contact\nother parties regarding a potential transaction at that time. The Board then instructed the Company\u2019s management\nand advisors to continue discussions with, and request an indication of interest from, Company A. The members of\nCompany management then informed the Board that it was also evaluating the implementation of potential cost\ncutting measures in light of the then-current economic environment and its impact on the Company\u2019s performance,\nbut that management would defer any decision on such implementation until the conclusion of the ongoing\ndiscussions with third parties regarding a partnership or other strategic transaction involving the Company. The\nmembers of Company management, Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent\nDirectors commenced an executive session with representatives of Cravath participating. The Independent Directors\nfurther discussed a potential response to the June 5 Proposal, noting that the proposal represented a substantial\nincrease of over 20% from the May 26 Proposal, that, during that same period, the Company\u2019s financial performance\nhad continued to be impacted by downward trends in the financial markets, and the risks associated with remaining a\nstandalone public company in such an environment, including the potential impact of a downturn on the Company\u2019s\nprofitability and therefore its ability to compensate and retain employees. The Independent Directors also noted that\nthe May 26 Proposal and June 5 Proposal were conditioned upon TD reaching satisfactory arrangements with certain\nmembers of the Company\u2019s senior management related to the \u201cchange of control\u201d severance entitlements, that there\nwas a risk that TD would not be able to reach an agreement with all requisite members of the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement, and that it was unlikely that TD or any other potential bidder that was expecting to retain the\nCompany\u2019s senior management team after an acquisition of the Company would be willing to pursue a transaction\nwithout reaching an agreement on retention\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\narrangements given the relative size of the \u201cchange of control\u201d severance entitlements compared to the Company\u2019s\nthen-current market capitalization. The Independent Directors discussed that the Independent Directors should\ncontinue to direct the process, and that, while the Company\u2019s management should not discuss the terms of any\nproposal relating to compensation or retention with potential counterparties to a transaction at that time, the\nCompany\u2019s management itself was a key asset of the Company and such discussions would need to occur at a later\ndate when authorized by the Independent Directors in order to facilitate a transaction.\nOn June 7, 2022, Mr. Ahmed contacted Mr. Solomon to discuss the status of the Board\u2019s evaluation of the June 5\nProposal. Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Ahmed that the Board was evaluating the June 5 Proposal with its financial\nadvisors and that the Company would respond once that evaluation was complete.\nOn June 8, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher contacted representatives of Cravath to discuss the status of\nthe Board\u2019s evaluation of the June 5 Proposal. Representatives of Cravath informed the representatives of Simpson\nThacher that the Board was evaluating the June 5 Proposal with its financial advisors and that the Company would\nrespond once that evaluation was complete, and that the Board did not have a fixed timeline for that evaluation.\nAlso on June 8, 2022, representatives of management of Company A and of the Company held a diligence call to\ndiscuss the potential sources of value in the Company\u2019s business outside of the Company\u2019s core investment banking\nand broker-dealer franchise (including the value of the Company\u2019s investment management business and balance\nsheet investments). Representatives of Perkins Advisors also participated in that meeting. During this meeting,\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s management and Perkins Advisors indicated to the representatives of Company A\nthat any indication of interest should reflect the net consideration payable to the holders of common stock based on\nthe Company\u2019s intrinsic value (also taking into account the value of these businesses and investments) and should\nnot be based on the then-current trading price of the class A common stock, which was $25.04 as of June 9, 2022, the\nlast trading day before such meeting.\nLater on June 8, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cravath, Ardea and Perkins Advisors attending. Mr. Barth opened the meeting\nby noting that, because the Financial Forecasts included the \u201cLow Case\u201d, \u201cBase Case\u201d and \u201cHigh Case\u201d, Ardea had\nrequested that the Independent Directors provide instructions to Ardea regarding which of such scenarios to utilize\nfor purposes of Ardea\u2019s preliminary financial analyses of the June 5 Proposal and the relative weighting of such\nscenarios. Mr. Barth then requested that the Company\u2019s management provide an update to the Independent Directors\non the Company\u2019s performance to date in the second quarter and near-term and long-term outlook. Mr. Solomon, Mr.\nCharney and Mr. Wieseneck then provided an update on the Company\u2019s financial performance, noting revenue\ndeclines in the Company\u2019s core businesses as compared to the annual budget as a result of reduced mergers &\nacquisitions and capital markets activity in the second quarter, particularly in industries such as biotechnology and\nspecial purpose acquisition vehicles in which the Company was active, as well as an expected decline in incentive\nfees for the Company\u2019s investment management business as a result of declining asset values. Mr. Solomon noted\nthat, while the macroeconomic outlook was difficult to predict, if the then-current business trends continued through\nthe remainder of 2022, the Company\u2019s performance would likely be below the Low Case Financial Forecasts and,\nabsent a partnership or other strategic transaction involving the Company, that management would look to implement\ncost cutting measures to counteract the impact of such trends on the Company\u2019s performance. The Board also\nrequested Ardea\u2019s views on the Financial Forecasts compared to updated Wall Street equity research analyst\nconsensus estimates for the Company\u2019s future earnings. Representatives of Ardea noted that at that point in time,\nWall Street equity research analyst consensus estimates for the Company\u2019s future earnings for fiscal years 2022 and\n2023 were approximately half-way between the Low Case and the Base Case Financial Forecasts, but that not all\nanalysts that covered the Company had updated their published forecasts recently and that such forecasts may\ndecline further following the Company\u2019s second quarter earnings announcement. The Board then discussed the\nweighting of the Financial Forecasts for purposes of Ardea\u2019s preliminary financial analyses, noting that while the\nCompany\u2019s performance was difficult to project over the long term given volatility in the financial markets, based on\nthen-current trends, the Low Case was the most likely of the scenarios reflected in the Financial Forecasts to occur.\nAfter discussion, the Independent Directors unanimously instructed Ardea to assign a probability weighting of 55%\nto the Low Case, 35% to the Base Case and 10% to the High Case in performing its financial analyses (which we refer\nto as the \u201cWeightings\u201d). The Independent Directors also instructed Ardea to assume, for purposes of its preliminary\nfinancial analyses, that the Company would remain a standalone public company and maintain the status quo for its\nbusiness mix (without\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexecuting any divestitures of any of the Company\u2019s assets), given the uncertainty in asset prices and the fact that the\nCompany had commenced a divestiture process for certain assets but had not yet received any formal indications of\ninterest for a specific proposal involving such assets. Mr. Solomon and representatives of Cravath informed the\nIndependent Directors of the outreach from TD and Simpson Thacher regarding the timing of the Board\u2019s evaluation.\nThe Board determined that it would convene a subsequent meeting once Ardea had prepared preliminary financial\nanalyses based on the instructions provided by the Independent Directors prior to responding to TD. The\nCompany\u2019s management also provided an update on the status of Company A\u2019s ongoing due diligence, and the\nBoard instructed the Company\u2019s management to continue facilitating such due diligence.\nOn June 10, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with representatives of Company A, including the Chief Executive Officer of\nCompany A\u2019s U.S. business, to discuss the potential strategic and cultural fit of their respective businesses.\nOn June 12, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (which we refer to as \u201cMorris Nichols\u201d),\noutside Delaware counsel to the Company, Ardea and Perkins Advisors attending. Ardea provided an overview of\ntheir preliminary financial analyses of the June 5 Proposal based on the Financial Forecasts and the Weightings.\nRepresentatives of Cravath then reviewed with the Board draft process guidelines that had been circulated to the\nBoard in advance of the meeting, which reiterated instructions that the Company\u2019s management should not discuss\nthe terms of any proposal relating to compensation or retention with potential counterparties to a transaction until\nspecifically authorized to do so by the Independent Directors, and stated that the Independent Directors would direct\nthe process and have ultimate decision-making authority with respect to all questions arising from such process. The\nguidelines also specified that at least one representative of Ardea should be included in any substantive\ncommunications with potential counterparties to a transaction on behalf of the Company, and that all such\ncommunications should be promptly reported to the Independent Directors.\nAfter discussion, the Board adopted such guidelines. Mr. Solomon noted to the Board that, while management did\nnot intend to negotiate compensation or retention arrangements with TD or other potential counterparties until\nspecifically authorized to do so by the Board, Mr. Solomon expected, based on preliminary discussions with\nindividual members of the Company\u2019s senior management team, that the retention arrangements communicated\nverbally in the May 26 Proposal would be inadequate to retain all desired members of the Company\u2019s management\nand that TD would likely need to improve the value and vesting terms of such retention arrangements if TD\u2019s\nproposals continued to be contingent on such arrangements. Mr. Solomon then provided the Board with an update\non discussions with TD and Company A, noting that TD was awaiting a response to the June 5 Proposal and that\nCompany A had continued to show interest in a potential transaction, including hiring a financial advisor and\nengaging members of senior management in meetings with the Company. After discussion, the members of Company\nmanagement exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with\nrepresentatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. The Independent Directors\ndiscussed the June 5 Proposal and potential responses to TD, including that TD had already materially increased its\nproposal by over 20% between the May 26 Proposal and the June 5 Proposal despite a continuing decline in broader\nfinancial markets, and whether TD would be willing to further improve the price of its proposal above $39.00 per\nshare. After discussion, the Independent Directors instructed Ardea and Perkins Advisors to communicate to Perella\nWeinberg that the $39.00 per share of common stock proposed in the June 5 Proposal was insufficient, and that TD\nshould submit an improved proposal in writing, which should also include details on any contingencies relating to\nretention arrangements with members of the Company\u2019s management and the proposed terms of such retention\narrangements so that the Board could assess whether a transaction would be achievable on the terms proposed. The\nIndependent Directors authorized Ardea and Perkins Advisors to communicate to TD that the Board expected a\nvaluation of at least $42.00 per share of common stock, which would represent an increase of $10.00 per share from\nthe May 26 Proposal. The Independent Directors also instructed Ardea and Perkins Advisors to continue\nengagement with Company A, and to encourage Company A to submit an indication of interest by the end of the\nweek of June 13, 2022. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting, and the Independent\nDirectors continued an executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols attending. The\nIndependent Directors then discussed the formal retention of Ardea as a financial advisor to the Company, noting\nthat Ardea had provided disclosure to the Board confirming that Ardea did not have any material business\nrelationships with TD, Company A or other potentially interested parties. After discussion, the Independent\nDirectors determined that it was advisable to continue with negotiating the terms of Ardea\u2019s engagement. The\nIndependent Directors also discussed the formal retention of Perkins Advisors as a financial advisor to the Company,\nnoting that Perkins Advisors had substantial industry knowledge and familiarity with Cowen\u2019s businesses, including\na long-standing relationship with the Company and its management. After discussion, the\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIndependent Directors determined that it was advisable to formally engage Perkins Advisors in connection with the\ntransaction, subject to compliance with the process guidelines discussed earlier in the meeting. The Independent\nDirectors also reaffirmed the proposed response to TD that had been discussed with Ardea and Perkins Advisors.\nLater on June 12, 2022, at the instruction of the Independent Directors, representatives of Ardea and Perkins\nAdvisors contacted representatives of Perella Weinberg and communicated that the $39.00 per share of common\nstock proposed in the June 5 Proposal was insufficient and that the Board had requested an improved proposal in\nwriting. The representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors also noted that the Board expected a valuation of at least\n$42.00 per share of common stock in order for the Board to be willing to approve a transaction at that time, and\nexpected that a written proposal would contain details on any contingencies relating to retention arrangements with\nmembers of the Company\u2019s management and the proposed terms of such retention arrangements. Representatives of\nPerella Weinberg responded that they were disappointed with the response but would update TD.\nOn June 13, 2022, Mr. Barth and Mr. Solomon spoke with Mr. Ahmed to reiterate the message communicated by\nArdea and Perkins Advisors and request an improved proposal in writing.\nAlso on June 13, 2022, at the instruction of the Independent Directors, representatives of Ardea and Perkins\nAdvisors contacted representatives of Company A and encouraged Company A to submit an indication of interest\nby the end of the week of June 13, 2022. Representatives of Company A subsequently responded that Company A\nwould need at least 10 days to formulate an indication of interest with a proposed valuation for an acquisition of the\noutstanding common stock of the Company.\nOn June 14, 2022, Mr. Solomon met with a representative of Company A, during which the representative of Company\nA conducted further diligence on the Company\u2019s business and the potential strategic rationale for an acquisition of\nthe Company and discussed potential social issues arising from such a combination, including the potential\nintegration of the Company into Company A\u2019s existing business lines and potential roles for the Company\u2019s\nmanagement team, with some business lines potentially led by current employees of the Company and some business\nlines led by existing employees of Company A. No financial terms of a potential transaction or proposed terms for\nretention arrangements regarding Company management were discussed.\nOn June 15, 2022, representatives of TD sent a letter to Mr. Barth reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire 100%\nof the Company\u2019s common stock for $39.00 in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 15 Proposal\u201d). The June 15\nProposal was expressly conditioned upon all members of the Company\u2019s management team with \u201cchange of control\u201d\nseverance agreements (including the Executives) waiving their rights under such existing agreements and entering\ninto new retention arrangements with TD on terms set forth in the June 15 Proposal. With respect to the Executives,\nthe terms of such arrangements set forth in the June 15 Proposal included, among others, (i) the grant of a retention\naward to each Executive, which the Company estimated to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives,\nof approximately $120 million, with 25% of each such award payable in cash at the closing of the potential transaction\nand 75% of each such award to be granted in the form of restricted share units in TD common stock vesting in equal\ninstallments on each of the first three anniversaries of such closing, and (ii) the payment of a pro rata bonus to each\nExecutive for the year of such closing based on actual performance of the Company through the date of such closing\n(rather than based on the average annual bonus of such Executive for the two years immediately preceding the year\nof employment termination, as provided in the existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreement of such Executive),\nwhich the Company estimated to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $23\nmillion, assuming such closing occurred by the end of calendar year 2022. The Company estimated the foregoing\nawards and payments to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $143 million. In\naddition, in its June 15 Proposal, TD proposed the restructuring of all Executives\u2019 unvested Company compensation\nawards to extend the existing vesting schedule of such awards so as to vest in equal installments on each of the first\nthree anniversaries of such closing (to the extent such restructuring would be permitted pursuant to applicable tax\nlaws). The June 15 Proposal was also conditioned upon completion of due diligence and also included a draft\nexclusivity agreement that would require the Company to terminate negotiations with any other party regarding a\npotential transaction and negotiate exclusively with TD for a period of four weeks from the date of the exclusivity\nagreement. The June 15 Proposal purported to expire on June 19, 2022, unless the Company and TD had entered into\nsuch exclusivity agreement by such date.\n39\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn June 16, 2022, representatives of Perella Weinberg and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors had a call\nto discuss the June 15 Proposal. The representatives of Perella Weinberg communicated that TD was not willing to\nincrease the proposed acquisition price above $39.00 per share previously communicated in the June 5 Proposal. The\nrepresentatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors indicated that they would discuss the June 15 Proposal with the\nBoard.\nAlso on June 16, 2022, representatives of Company A spoke with a representative of Perkins Advisors and\ncommunicated that Company A was working to submit an indication of interest for an acquisition of all of the\noutstanding common stock of the Company during the week of June 20. A representative of Company A also\ncommunicated that Company A had analyzed potential integration plans and envisioned roles for Mr. Solomon, Mr.\nCharney and Mr. Wieseneck in the combined organization. The representative of Perkins Advisors encouraged the\nrepresentatives of Company A to submit its proposal as promptly as possible.\nLater on June 16, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating.\nRepresentatives of Ardea provided an overview of the June 15 Proposal and reviewed their preliminary financial\nanalyses of the June 15 Proposal. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the members of the Board their\nfiduciary duties and other legal matters. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then provided an update to\nthe Board on their recent discussions with Perella Weinberg and with representatives of Company A. The Board then\ndiscussed the June 15 Proposal, noting that TD had been unwilling to increase the proposed price per share of\ncommon stock beyond $39.00 per share, but that TD had maintained such proposed price per share despite a broader\ndecline in equity markets and an approximate 13% decline in the trading price of the class A common stock from\n$26.18 on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to the June 5 Proposal, to $22.88 on June 15, 2022. After discussion,\nthe Independent Directors determined that while $39.00 per share of common stock represented compelling value for\nthe Company, particularly in light of the market environment, TD had not increased its proposal from the June 5\nProposal and the Independent Directors were not willing to grant exclusivity, which could have precluded a\ncompeting proposal from Company A or any other interested party, at such valuation. After discussion regarding a\npotential response and counter-proposal to TD, the Board determined that it would convene a subsequent meeting\nthe next day to continue discussion of a response to the June 15 Proposal.\nOn June 17, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. The Board continued\ndiscussions regarding the June 15 Proposal, including the fact that the June 15 Proposal was conditioned upon all\nmembers of the Company\u2019s senior management team with \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements waiving their\nrights under their existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements and entering into retention arrangements\nrepresenting a reduction in value as compared to such agreements, and that there was no guarantee that all members\nof the Company\u2019s senior management team would be willing to do so absent agreement on roles and responsibilities\nwith TD. Mr. Solomon noted that while he expected that there would be a negotiation among members of the\nCompany\u2019s senior management team and TD regarding the proposed retention arrangements if and when the\nIndependent Directors authorized management to engage in such negotiations, he expected that satisfactory\narrangements could be reached because the requisite members of the Company\u2019s senior management team had\nexpressed to Mr. Solomon that they would be willing to negotiate compensation arrangements that had a lower value\nthan their existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance entitlements if so required in connection with a transaction. The\nmembers of Company management and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors\ncommenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Ardea participating. In\nexecutive session, the Independent Directors discussed a potential response to the June 15 Proposal. After\ndiscussion, the Independent Directors instructed Ardea to communicate to TD that, while the June 15 Proposal was\ninsufficient to warrant exclusivity, the Board would be willing to engage in further discussions and to authorize\nmembers of the Company\u2019s management to engage in discussions with TD regarding post-closing employment and\ncompensation arrangements if TD increased its proposal to $41.00 per share, and that the Board would be willing to\nconsider exclusivity only after TD had increased its proposal to $41.00 per share and satisfied the other conditions to\nthe June 15 Proposal, including completion of TD\u2019s substantive due diligence and agreement on satisfactory\nretention arrangements with members of the Company\u2019s management. The Independent Directors also discussed\npotential communications to Company A in order to cause Company A to provide an indication of interest on an\naccelerated timeframe, and instructed Ardea to communicate to Company A that any indication of interest needed to\nbe delivered to the Company by the close\n40\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nof business on June 22, 2022. Representatives of Ardea then exited the meeting, and the Independent Directors\ncontinued the executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. The Independent\nDirectors discussed the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and broader financial markets\nreflected in the Company\u2019s then-current stock price, which had declined to a 52-week low of $21.36 on June 16, 2022,\nand noted that the Independent Directors shared the Company management\u2019s continuing concern for the Company\u2019s\nbusiness outlook if that environment continued.\nOn June 17, 2022, following the Board meeting, representatives of Ardea communicated the Independent Directors\u2019\nposition to representatives of Perella Weinberg. Shortly thereafter, representatives of Perella Weinberg contacted\nrepresentatives of Ardea and communicated that TD was unwilling to increase its proposal above $39.00 per share of\ncommon stock given the continued decline in equity market conditions since TD had first communicated a proposal\nof $39.00 per share of common stock on June 5, 2022. Mr. Barth and Mr. Solomon also contacted Mr. Ahmed to\ncommunicate the Independent Directors\u2019 position to Mr. Ahmed directly, and Mr. Ahmed reiterated that TD was\nunwilling to increase its proposal above $39.00 per share of common stock given market conditions and the impact of\nmarket conditions on the Company\u2019s recent performance and short-term outlook.\nAlso on June 17, 2022, representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors contacted representatives of Company A\u2019s\nfinancial advisor and indicated that the Company\u2019s timetable for evaluating alternatives had shifted and requested\nthat Company A submit an indication of interest by the close of business on June 22, 2022. Representatives of\nCompany A\u2019s financial advisor responded that, based on internal scheduling, it was unlikely that Company A would\nbe in a position to submit an indication of interest on such timetable. Subsequent to that discussion, a representative\nof Company A contacted a representative of Perkins Advisors to discuss the timetable, and indicated that Company\nA would endeavor to submit an indication of interest promptly. The representative of Company A also indicated that\nCompany A would like to discuss \u201cchange of control\u201d severance arrangements with members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement. The representative of Perkins Advisors replied that the Independent Directors would not authorize the\nCompany\u2019s management to engage in such discussions until the Board had received a proposal for the value that\nCompany A was prepared to offer to the holders of common stock and the Board had evaluated such proposal.\nLater on June 17, 2022, the Board reconvened a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Barth\nand representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors provided updates to the Board on discussions with\nrepresentatives of TD and Company A after the earlier Board meeting. The Board then discussed proposed\nresponses and communications to each of TD and Company A. The Board noted that the Company had already\nrequested that TD improve its proposal on three occasions, and on each occasion TD had reverted with a proposal of\n$39.00 per share of common stock and had repeatedly expressed an unwillingness to improve such proposal. The\nBoard also noted that while Company A had not yet submitted an indication of interest, Company A continued to\nexpress strong interest in a potential acquisition of the Company and, given similarities in the Company\u2019s and\nCompany A\u2019s respective businesses, Company A may be able to achieve greater cost synergies (but lower revenue\nsynergies) than TD in a potential transaction. After discussion, the Board determined that, in light of the value\nreflected in the June 15 Proposal compared to the Company\u2019s prospects as a standalone public company, including\nthe risks of operating in any prolonged market downturn, it was advisable and in the best interests of the Company\nand its stockholders to pursue further discussions with TD on the basis of the June 15 Proposal, but that the Board\nwas not willing to grant exclusivity to TD, given that TD had not improved its proposal above $39.00 per share of\ncommon stock and that Company A had not yet submitted an indication of interest. The members of Company\nmanagement and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive\nsession with representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols and Ardea participating. The Independent Directors noted\nthat while the Board was willing to pursue further discussions with TD on the basis of the June 15 Proposal, the June\n15 Proposal was not actionable absent an agreement between TD and members of the Company\u2019s management\nregarding retention arrangements. After discussion, the Independent Directors authorized management to begin\ndiscussions with TD regarding post-closing compensation and retention arrangements, subject to guidelines for the\nconduct of such discussions to be prepared by Cravath and adopted by the Independent Directors, including\nrequirements that members of the Company\u2019s management keep the Independent Directors apprised of any material\ndevelopments with respect to such discussions, that management not finalize any arrangements with TD or\nmemorialize any arrangements in definitive written agreements until the Independent Directors had authorized\nmanagement to do so, that management continue interacting with other interested counterparties where directed by\nthe Independent Directors and that members of management retain separate legal counsel in their individual\ncapacities to represent members of management in negotiations of any\n41\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncompensation or retention arrangements with TD. The Independent Directors instructed Ardea to communicate this\nauthorization to Perella Weinberg, and Cravath to communicate these guidelines to the Company\u2019s management team.\nRepresentatives of Ardea then exited the meeting, and the Independent Directors continued the executive session,\nwith representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. The Independent Directors discussed the\ndifficulties associated with retaining management and key employees in a prolonged downturn, and the importance to\na potential transaction with TD that TD reach agreement with the Company\u2019s management on satisfactory retention\narrangements.\nFollowing the Board meeting, representatives of Ardea communicated the Board\u2019s response to representatives of\nPerella Weinberg, and Mr. Solomon, acting upon the authorization of the Independent Directors, contacted Mr.\nAhmed to inform Mr. Ahmed that management had been authorized to begin discussing compensation or retention\narrangements with TD.\nBeginning on June 18, 2022, Mr. Solomon held numerous meetings and conversations with Mr. Ahmed over the\nfollowing weeks, with other representatives of management of TD and the Company participating in certain\ndiscussions, to discuss a variety of topics related to compensation and retention, including potential management\nstructure and reporting lines following a potential transaction, TD\u2019s proposed retention arrangements and post-\nclosing compensation arrangements for the Company\u2019s senior management team (including whether such\ncompensation would be guaranteed or based on target bonus levels) and the companies\u2019 respective compensation\nphilosophies for other employees. These discussions spanned numerous topics regarding elements of the post-\nclosing compensation structure for non-management employees of the Company, Company management\u2019s role in\ndetermining compensation for Company employees post-closing and assurances that could be communicated to the\nCompany\u2019s employees prior to closing a potential transaction in order to ensure that the Company would be able to\ncontinue to recruit and retain key employees prior to closing. Mr. Solomon regularly updated Cravath and the\nIndependent Directors on these discussions.\nDuring this period, the Company also continued discussions with Company A regarding a potential transaction and\ncontinued providing due diligence information to Company A, and on June 20, 2022, Mr. Barth had a conversation\nwith a representative of Company A to discuss the status of Company A\u2019s evaluation and to reiterate that Company\nA would need to submit a proposal promptly in order for the Board to consider such proposal.\nOn June 22, 2022, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Barth reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock based on an aggregate purchase of $1.45 billion, subject to reduction based on (i) any\n\u201cchange of control\u201d payments or similar entitlements of the Company\u2019s management and employees, (ii) any future\nguaranteed payments by Company A to retain identified existing Company personnel and (iii) the principal payment\nof the preferred stock (which we refer to as the \u201cJune 22 Company A Proposal\u201d). The June 22 Company A Proposal\nwas also subject to due diligence, and requested that the Company terminate negotiations with any other party\nregarding a potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with Company A for a period of 60 days from the date of\nthe Company\u2019s acceptance of the Proposal. The June 22 Company A Proposal was also subject to various regulatory\napprovals, including anticipated approvals required from the Federal Reserve Board and international banking\nregulators.\nFollowing receipt of the June 22 Company A Proposal, representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors contacted\nrepresentatives of Company A\u2019s financial advisor to discuss the June 22 Company A Proposal, and indicated that,\nwhile the June 22 Company A Proposal did not attempt to quantify the potential adjustments to the purchase price or\nthe net consideration to the holders of common stock, based on the Company\u2019s fully diluted share count and existing\n\u201cchange of control\u201d severance arrangements, Ardea estimated the net price to holders of common stock to be\napproximately $30 to $32 per share of common stock, which representatives of Company A\u2019s financial advisor\nsignaled agreement with. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors indicated that they would discuss the\nproposal with the Board, but indicated disappointment with both the valuation and the fact that, despite the\nCompany\u2019s prior requests, the June 22 Company A Proposal was not based on the net consideration payable to the\nholders of common stock.\nOn or about June 23, 2022, the Executives responded to TD with a counterproposal to the terms of the proposed new\nretention arrangements included in the June 15 Proposal, the terms of which included, among others, (i) the payment\nof the retention awards included in the June 15 Proposal in cash in equal installments on each of the first three\nanniversaries of the closing of a potential transaction in lieu of the restricted share units in TD common stock\nincluded in the June 15 Proposal, which the Company estimated to be equivalent to an\n42\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\naggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $183 million, and (ii) the payment of a pro rata bonus to each\nExecutive for the year of such closing in an amount equal to 80% of such Executive\u2019s pro rata bonus entitlement\nunder such Executive\u2019s existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements, which the Company estimated to be\nequivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $52 million, assuming such closing occurred\non September 30, 2022. The Company estimated the foregoing awards and payments to be equivalent to an aggregate\namount, for all Executives, of approximately $235 million. In addition, the Executives proposed that the Executives\u2019\nunvested Company compensation awards would not be restructured and would continue to vest on their original\nvesting schedule.\nOn June 24, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Representatives of Ardea\nreviewed the economic terms of the June 22 Company A Proposal and provided an overview of their discussion with\nCompany A\u2019s financial advisor. After discussion, the Board determined that, given the valuation and uncertainty\nassociated with the June 22 Company A Proposal, the June 22 Company A Proposal was insufficient in its current\nform. Mr. Solomon then provided an update to the Independent Directors on the status of negotiations between\nmembers of management and TD regarding compensation matters, noting that while progress had been made on the\nindividual retention arrangements for members of management and TD, no agreement had yet been reached on such\narrangements between the Executives and TD and discussions were also ongoing regarding post-closing\ncompensation structures for the remaining employees to ensure the success of the combined business and retention\nof employees prior to closing the potential transaction. The Board then discussed whether, in light of the June 22\nCompany A Proposal, it was advisable to contact any other potential counterparties to assess interest in a potential\ntransaction with the Company. The Board discussed that, while a limited number of potential counterparties may be\ninterested in a transaction involving the Company, making such outreach would increase the risk of a potential public\nleak, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, and that certain counterparties may attempt\nto recruit the Company\u2019s key employees in the event of a leak. The members of Company management then exited the\nmeeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris\nNichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. The Independent Directors discussed a potential response to the\nJune 22 Company A Proposal. After discussion, the Independent Directors instructed Ardea to communicate to\nCompany A that the June 22 Company A Proposal was insufficient, that any revised proposal should be based solely\non the net price per share payable to the holders of common stock, and Company A\u2019s proposed price per share of\ncommon stock would need to be at or above $40.00\u037e otherwise Company A would risk losing the opportunity for a\ntransaction involving the Company. The representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting, and\nthe Independent Directors continued the executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols\nparticipating. After discussion among the Independent Directors and representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols,\nthe Independent Directors determined that it was advisable, given the risk of a potential leak and the potential impact\nof a leak on the organization (including employee retention), for the Company to continue discussions with TD and\nCompany A but not to contact any other potential counterparties at that time. Following the meeting, representatives\nof Ardea and Perkins Advisors communicated the Board\u2019s response to Company A.\nOn June 27, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Mr. Barth to discuss the Board\u2019s response to the June 22\nCompany A Proposal. The representative of Company A reiterated Company A\u2019s interest in a strategic transaction\ninvolving the Company and noted that Company A had accelerated its evaluation of a potential transaction based on\nguidance from the Company. Mr. Barth confirmed that while the Board was appreciative of Company A\u2019s interest, the\nstructure of the June 22 Company A Proposal was problematic and that in order to properly evaluate a proposal, the\nBoard would need an indication of value, net to the holders of common stock. The representative of Company A\nnoted that the Company\u2019s existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance obligations made it difficult to provide certainty of\nvalue. In response, Mr. Barth explained that Company A would be permitted to separately negotiate retention\narrangements with members of management with \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements, but that the\nIndependent Directors and Company A would need to reach an agreement on the price per share of common stock\nfirst. The representative of Company A highlighted that Company A would not pay the full value of the Company\u2019s\nexisting \u201cchange of control\u201d severance obligations and would propose to pay management significantly lower\namounts in respect of retention, or else to forgo retention awards entirely and have management remain in their\ncurrent roles with the Company after the consummation of a potential transaction. Mr. Barth reiterated that this was\nfor the Company\u2019s management to negotiate with Company A if Company A and the Independent Directors first\nreached an agreement on price. The representative of Company A and Mr. Barth also discussed the overall valuation\nof the June\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n22 Company A Proposal, with Mr. Barth reiterating that the Independent Directors had requested that any revised\nproposal include a price per share of common stock at or above $40.00. The representative of Company A replied that\nCompany A did not have an ability to pay a price anywhere in the vicinity of $40.00 per share of common stock.\nDuring the week of June 25, 2022, representatives of management of the Company and TD continued discussions\nregarding due diligence and compensation matters, including providing TD and its advisors with access to the\nCompany\u2019s full data room and discussing compensation structures for the combined organization following a\npotential transaction and retention arrangements for the Executives.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Executives and TD reached a preliminary agreement in principle on retention arrangements, the\nterms of which included, among others, (i) the grant of a retention award to each Executive, which the Company\nestimated to be equivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $129 million, with one-third of\neach such award payable in cash at the closing of the potential transaction and two-thirds of each such award to be\ngranted in the form of deferred cash awards vesting in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of\nsuch closing, (ii) the grant of integration awards in the form of cash awards to certain Executives that cliff vest on the\nthird anniversary of such closing in an aggregate amount for all such Executives of $18 million and (iii) flexibility\nunder the interim operating covenants of the proposed merger agreement for the Company to determine and allocate\nemployee bonuses (including for the Executives) for calendar year 2022 based on compensation principles that are\nconsistent with the Company\u2019s past practices. The Company estimated the foregoing awards and payments to be\nequivalent to an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $147 million exclusive of (i) any annual\nbonuses for calendar year 2022 that the Executives may be allocated by the Company and (ii) severance entitlements\nin an aggregate amount, for all Executives, of approximately $22 million payable only in the event of a qualifying\ntermination by TD within the first half of the first fiscal year of such closing. The Executives and TD also agreed to\nthe restructuring of certain unvested Company compensation awards to extend the existing vesting schedule of such\nawards so as to vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of such closing (to the extent such\nrestructuring would be permitted pursuant to applicable tax laws) and to entitlements to severance benefits upon a\nqualifying termination pursuant to a formula to be set forth in the employment agreements between the Executives\nand TD based on the year of termination and under TD\u2019s general severance policy applicable to similarly situated\nemployees. No new employment agreements were contemplated for any other employees of the Company. For a\ndetailed discussion of the material terms of the Executives\u2019 employment arrangements, including severance and\nretention entitlements, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement.\nAlso on June 30, 2022, TD communicated to representatives of the Company that Simpson Thacher would be sending\ndrafts of a merger agreement and employment agreements to Cravath, and members of management retained\nemployment counsel to represent members of management in their individual capacities in the review and negotiation\nof such employment agreements.\nOn June 30, 2022, a representative of Company A\u2019s financial advisor contacted a representative of Ardea and\ninformed the representative of Ardea that Company A was continuing its analysis of a potential transaction and\nexpected that it may submit a revised proposal by July 5, 2022, which may include a range in \u201cthe high $30s\u201d per\nshare of common stock. The representative of Ardea reiterated the Board\u2019s request that any revised proposal include\na price per share of common stock at or above $40.00. Later that day, a representative of Company A contacted a\nrepresentative of Perkins Advisors to communicate the same message, and suggested that Company A was internally\nevaluating a proposal with a price per share of common stock at or above $40.00.\nAlso on June 30, 2022, a representative of a financial advisor (which we refer to as \u201cFinancial Advisor X\u201d), contacted\nMr. Solomon to indicate that Financial Advisor X was meeting with an undisclosed potential client that may be\ninterested in a transaction with the Company. Mr. Solomon acknowledged but did not comment on the information\nprovided by Financial Advisor X. Later on June 30, 2022, Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Barth of the inquiry from\nFinancial Advisor X.\nOn July 1, 2022, after the close of trading, Bloomberg News reported a rumor that TD was exploring an acquisition of\nthe Company, although no decision had been made.\nLater on July 1, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of\nCravath. The draft included, among other things, a proposed termination fee, which would be payable by the\nCompany upon the occurrence of certain events, including the Company\u2019s termination of the merger agreement\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto accept a superior proposal (which we refer to as a \u201ccompany termination fee\u201d), of 4.0% of the equity value of the\npotential transaction. The draft also included an indication that TD would expect TD\u2019s obligations to close the merger\nto be conditioned on the receipt of certain client consents (and \u201ckey person\u201d provisions not being triggered) in\nconnection with the Company\u2019s investment management and advisory businesses, and limited TD\u2019s obligations to\ntake or agree to conditions or restrictions in connection with obtaining consents or approvals required in connection\nwith the merger to those that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably be expected\nto have a material and adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TD and its\nsubsidiaries, taken as a whole (with TD deemed to be the same size as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a\nwhole).\nOn July 2, 2022, members of the Company\u2019s senior management met virtually with Mr. Ahmed and a senior Human\nResources professional from TD to further discuss TD\u2019s compensation programs as well as the Company\u2019s\ncompensation practices. The executives agreed that they would seek to structure compensation programs for non-\nexecutive employees to ensure the success of the combined business and retention of employees prior to closing the\npotential transaction. Later that day, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the\nCompany\u2019s management and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating.\nMr. Solomon provided an update to the Board on discussions with TD, noting that while there had been some\nchallenges with respect to discussions regarding compensation policies, talks had progressed and management was\nexpecting to receive individual employment agreements from TD shortly, and that Simpson Thacher had provided an\ninitial draft of the merger agreement to Cravath, which Cravath was reviewing. In light of the public reports regarding\na potential transaction with TD the prior day, Mr. Solomon also provided the Board with an overview of the other\ninquiries that he or the Company\u2019s advisors had received. Mr. Solomon noted that the Chief Executive Officer of\nCompany B, an independent U.S. investment bank, had tried to contact and left a voicemail for Mr. Solomon on June\n15, 2022 to informally inquire whether he and Mr. Solomon should have a routine dinner but that, to Mr. Solomon\u2019s\nknowledge, such inquiry was not in relation to any particular strategic transaction. Company B had previously been\ndiscussed by the Board as a potentially interested counterparty. The Board then discussed the inbound call from\nFinancial Advisor X on June 30, and Mr. Solomon noted that, as of the time of the Board meeting, Financial Advisor\nX had not yet identified its potential client. After discussion, the Board instructed Mr. Solomon to engage with\nCompany B and any other potential counterparties that expressed interest, but that the Company should not confirm\nto any competitor of the Company that it was engaged in discussions regarding a potential acquisition unless such\ncompetitor has expressed a bona fide interest in making an acquisition proposal. Representatives of Ardea and\nPerkins Advisors then exited the meeting, and the Independent Directors continued the executive session, with\nrepresentatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. The Independent Directors discussed potential\nreactions to a proposal from Company A. The Independent Directors also discussed that, prior to the Bloomberg\nNews report on July 1, 2022, the Company was expecting to receive preliminary indications of interest in the coming\nweeks in connection with the Company\u2019s ongoing asset divestiture processes, but that the Board did not believe it\nwas likely that the Company would receive an attractive proposal in the then-current macroeconomic environment,\nparticularly in light of the uncertainty as to the Company\u2019s future given market rumors.\nOn July 4, 2022, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Barth reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock for $40.00 in cash (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 4 Company A Proposal\u201d). The July 4\nCompany A Proposal was subject to due diligence, which the letter indicated Company A expected to complete within\n60 days of the Company\u2019s countersignature of the letter, and requested that the Company terminate negotiations with\nany other party regarding a potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with Company A for a period of 60 days.\nThe July 4 Company A Proposal was also subject to various regulatory approvals, including anticipated approvals\nrequired from the Federal Reserve Board and international banking regulators. Additionally, the July 4 Company A\nProposal noted that Company A expected to discuss with management retention payments and contractual payments\nin lieu of existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance entitlements, and proposed that Company A would spend the initial\nfive business days following countersignature of the letter by the Company working with the Company\u2019s\nmanagement team to agree to an aggregate retention pool for existing non-executive employees as well as mutually\nagreed contractual arrangements with the seven members of the Company\u2019s senior management team with existing\n\u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of the capital markets business of Company C, an international bank with\na U.S. investment banking business, contacted Mr. Solomon, and indicated that while Company C had not been\npreviously considering a transaction with the Company, Company C would consider evaluating a transaction with the\nCompany if the Company were interested and inquired whether Company C should pursue\n45\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthat opportunity imminently. Mr. Solomon informed the Chief Executive Officer of Company C that, given the press\nreports, the Company was receiving interest and if Company C wanted to pursue a transaction time was of the\nessence, and that Company C could contact Ardea to discuss.\nOn July 5, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Representatives of Ardea\nand Cravath reviewed the terms of the July 4 Company A Proposal. The Board discussed the terms of the July 4\nCompany A Proposal, noting that the proposal offered a higher notional value per share of common stock than the\n$39.00 reflected in the June 15 Proposal, but that the July 4 Company A Proposal was subject to due diligence and\ncontingent upon reaching an agreement with members of the Company\u2019s management regarding retention\narrangements and did not include any proposal for such retention arrangements. The Board also noted Company A\nhad requested a substantially longer period than TD to complete its due diligence and that Company A\u2019s proposal\nincluded additional regulatory conditions (including anticipated approvals required from the Federal Reserve Board\nand international banking regulators). After discussion, the Board determined that it was advisable for the Company\nto reject Company A\u2019s request for exclusivity and to continue discussions and facilitating due diligence with each of\nTD and Company A, so that each party could complete its due diligence and satisfy any remaining conditions to its\nproposal as quickly as possible. The Independent Directors instructed the Company\u2019s management and advisors to\ngrant Company A access to the Company\u2019s full data room and to share a draft merger agreement with Company A\nsimultaneously with sharing a revised draft with TD. The Independent Directors also authorized management to\nbegin discussions with Company A regarding post-closing compensation and retention arrangements, subject to\nguidelines to be prepared by Cravath and adopted by the Independent Directors consistent with the guidelines for\nnegotiations with TD. Mr. Solomon then provided an update to the Board on the inquiry from Company C. The\nmembers of Company management and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and\nthe Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols\nparticipating. The Independent Directors noted that, because the proposals from each of TD and Company A were\ncontingent upon reaching satisfactory retention arrangements with the Company\u2019s management, and the Company\u2019s\nmanagement had not yet reached agreement on such arrangements with either party, it was advisable to continue\ndiscussions with both counterparties and to continue engaging with other potential counterparties that had\nexpressed interest.\nLater on July 5, 2022, following the Board meeting, acting on the July 2 instructions of the Board, Mr. Solomon\nattempted to contact the Chief Executive Officer of Company B to assess whether Company B would like to have a\nconversation with the Company, and left a voicemail for the Chief Executive Officer of Company B.\nAlso on July 5, 2022, a representative of Financial Advisor X contacted Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that\nFinancial Advisor X was representing Company D, a U.S. bank with a domestic investment banking business, and\nthat Company D was interested in a potential acquisition of the Company and may be prepared to pay \u201ca large\npremium\u201d. Mr. Solomon requested that, if Company D were interested, Company D submit an indication with a range\nof potential values for the Board to consider. Mr. Solomon and the representative of Financial Advisor X then\ndiscussed arranging a meeting between Mr. Solomon and the Chief Executive Officer of Company D. Later that day,\nMr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent Directors on the inquiry from Company D.\nOn July 6, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of Company B tried to contact and left a voicemail for Mr. Solomon\ninforming Mr. Solomon that he was returning Mr. Solomon\u2019s phone call from July 5, 2022. Over the following days,\nMr. Solomon and the Chief Executive Officer of Company B tried again to contact and left voicemails for one another.\nMr. Solomon left a final voicemail for the Chief Executive Officer of Company B which was not returned, and there\nwas no further contact from Company B.\nAlso on July 6, 2022, a representative of Company A sent Mr. Solomon a retention proposal for the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement with \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements, which consisted of guaranteed minimum compensation\nfor such employees, retention payments to such employees based on the proceeds realized by Company A from sales\nof certain non-core assets of the Company during a three-year period after the closing of the proposed transaction\n(or, if sales of any of such assets were not executed, an agreed valuation of such remaining assets) and opportunities\nfor additional incentive compensation based on the performance of the businesses formerly comprising the Company,\nwith the sum of all such payments being capped at an amount equal to 70% of the value of each employee\u2019s\ncontractual \u201cchange of control\u201d severance entitlements. Company A\u2019s proposal did not include specific proposals\nregarding roles and responsibilities for individuals of\n46\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe Company\u2019s senior management team or any additional detail regarding compensation strategies to retain non-\nmanagement employees. Mr. Solomon provided an update to the Independent Directors, noting that the\ncompensation proposal from Company A was substantially less favorable than the retention package that had been\nagreed in principle between the Executives and TD on June 30, 2022, partly because the incentive compensation\nopportunities of such package were based on highly contingent factors that would be outside of the control of the\nCompany\u2019s management team, but that there also remained open concerns with TD\u2019s retention proposals, including\nwhether annual compensation opportunities for the Executives would be guaranteed.\nOn July 7, 2022, Mr. Solomon had a call with a representative of Company A to discuss Company A\u2019s July 6 retention\nproposal. A representative of Perkins Advisors participated at Mr. Solomon\u2019s request. During this call, Mr. Solomon\nproposed to Company A a retention package for the Executives that was comparable to the retention package that\nhad been agreed in principle between the Executives and TD on June 30, 2022 (which proposal represented aggregate\npayments to the Executives substantially below the value of such Executives\u2019 existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance\nentitlements) and discussed structural issues relating to roles in the combined organization, including the impact of\nintegrating the Company\u2019s businesses with Company A\u2019s existing investment banking business on reporting lines\nand on retention of key talent between signing and closing a potential transaction. Company A acknowledged Mr.\nSolomon\u2019s proposal and that it would respond following internal discussion thereof.\nAlso on July 7, 2022, the Company shared a draft mutual confidentiality agreement with Company D, and a\nrepresentative of Financial Advisor X contacted a representative of Ardea to communicate that Company D expected\nto submit an indication of interest in writing on July 8, 2022.\nLater on July 7, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating.\nRepresentatives of Ardea informed the Board that Company D was expected to submit an indication of interest in\nwriting on July 8, 2022, but had not yet indicated a range of potential values. Mr. Solomon provided the Board with an\nupdate on retention discussions between the Company\u2019s management and each of Company A and TD, noting that\nopen issues remained with both parties. Mr. Solomon noted that TD had conducted substantial confirmatory due\ndiligence and had indicated a potential ability to sign and announce a transaction as early as July 18, 2022. Mr.\nSolomon also provided an update on discussions with Company B and Company C, noting that neither party had\nfollowed up to express further interest in a transaction involving the Company as of that date. The members of\nCompany management and representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the\nIndependent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols\nparticipating. The Independent Directors noted that Mr. Solomon and other members of the Company\u2019s senior\nmanagement had substantial concerns with the retention packages and compensation structures for non-\nmanagement employees proposed by each of TD and Company A, but that both potential transactions were still\nviable. After discussion, the Independent Directors resolved to instruct Mr. Solomon to continue negotiations with\neach of TD and Company A and to keep the Independent Directors informed of any developments, and Mr. Barth\ncommunicated that instruction to Mr. Solomon.\nOn July 8, 2022, a representative of Company A contacted Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that Company A\nwould not be able to reach mutual agreement with management on its proposed retention package for the Executives\nor on the proposed organizational, compensation and retention structure for the Company\u2019s employees as a part of\nCompany A following the proposed transaction, as such retention and organizational structures would be too\ndisruptive to Company A\u2019s existing business. Mr. Solomon asked whether Company A had any counter-proposals\nregarding retention and organizational structures to discuss further, and the representative of Company A confirmed\nthat Company A did not have a counter-proposal. Mr. Solomon thanked the representative of Company A for the time\nand effort that he and his team had made, but did not engage in any further negotiations and promptly informed the\nIndependent Directors.\nLater on July 8, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Solomon provided an\nupdate to the Board on his discussions with Company A regarding retention and compensation matters, noting that\nCompany A had expressed that it would not be able to reach mutual agreement with management on its proposed\nretention package for the Executives or on the proposed organizational, compensation and retention structure for the\nCompany\u2019s employees as a part of Company A following the proposed transaction, as such retention and\norganizational structures would be too disruptive to Company A\u2019s\n47\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nexisting business, that Company A did not present a counter-proposal, and that the condition to the July 4 Company\nA Proposal therefore would not be satisfied. The Board instructed Ardea and Perkins Advisors to contact Company\nA\u2019s financial advisor the following week if Company A had not reengaged to confirm whether there was a potential\npath to a transaction on the terms of the July 4 Company A Proposal. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed the\nterms of the draft merger agreement received from TD with the Board.\nDuring that Board meeting, Company D sent a letter to Mr. Solomon reflecting a non-binding proposal to acquire\n100% of the Company\u2019s common stock for consideration in the range of $1.539 billion to $1.847 billion, which\nCompany D calculated as equivalent to $40.00 to $48.00 per share of common stock based on an estimated 38.5 million\nshares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (which we refer to as the \u201cJuly 8 Company D Proposal\u201d).\nThe July 8 Company D Proposal was subject to due diligence, and requested that the Company terminate\nnegotiations with any other party regarding a potential transaction and negotiate exclusively with Company D for a\nperiod of 60 days from the date of the Company\u2019s acceptance of the proposal. The July 8 Company D Proposal was\nalso subject to various regulatory approvals, including approvals that would likely be required from the Federal\nReserve Board and international banking regulators. The July 8 Company D Proposal noted that Company D\nwelcomed the opportunity to discuss customary terms of retention of Company personnel at the appropriate time\nduring the process but did not include any proposals for management retention or specify any individuals that would\nbe expected to agree to retention terms.\nAfter review and discussion, the Board noted that the July 8 Company D Proposal would be equivalent to $39.36 to\n$47.24 per share of common stock utilizing the Company\u2019s then-current share count of approximately 39.1 million\nshares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and the range of valuations reflected in the July 8\nCompany D Proposal was higher than the $39.00 per share of common stock proposed by TD in the June 15 Proposal.\nHowever, the Board noted that the July 8 Company D Proposal was preliminary, reflected a wide range of potential\nvaluations, was subject to substantial due diligence, and was silent as to certain structural elements (including\nwhether the consideration would be in the form of cash or stock consideration and whether the proposal was\ncontingent on retention of Company personnel). After discussion, the Board noted that, if actionable, the July 8\nCompany D Proposal may provide greater value to the holders of common stock than the value proposed by either\nTD or Company A, and the Board instructed the Company\u2019s management and advisors to enter into a confidentiality\nagreement with Company D and to facilitate Company D\u2019s due diligence as quickly as possible. In addition, the Board\ninstructed Ardea to request that Company D provide an updated proposal by July 14, 2022, reflecting a narrower\nprice range based on Company D\u2019s initial due diligence and reflecting Company D\u2019s assumptions regarding retention\nof management and any required retention arrangements. The members of Company management then exited the\nmeeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath, Morris\nNichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. After further discussion regarding the response and messaging\nto Company D, the representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors exited the meeting. Representatives of Cravath\nthen discussed with the Independent Directors certain proposed revisions to the merger agreement with TD. After\ndiscussion, the Independent Directors authorized Cravath to send a revised draft merger agreement to TD reflecting,\namong other things, a proposed company termination fee of $30.0 million, or approximately 2.0% of transaction equity\nvalue, the removal of any closing conditions based on client consents and any key person conditions, if applicable,\nwith respect to the Company\u2019s investment management and advisory businesses, and a \u201chell or high water\u201d\nregulatory standard requiring TD to take or agree to all actions or restrictions necessary in order to obtain any\nregulatory approvals required to consummate the merger.\nOn July 9, 2022, Mr. Solomon had a call with the Chief Executive Officer of Company D\u2019s investment banking division,\nduring which Company D expressed that Company D was interested in the Company\u2019s research, investment banking\nand equity capital markets and equities trading businesses. Company D also indicated that they viewed the proposed\ntransaction as a \u201cmerger of equals\u201d for the companies\u2019 respective investment banking businesses.\nOn July 10, 2022, the Company and Company D entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement, which contained a\nstandstill provision that would automatically terminate upon the entry by the Company into a definitive acquisition\nagreement with a third party.\nOn July 11, 2022, representatives of Cravath shared a revised draft merger agreement with representatives of Simpson\nThacher reflecting the positions authorized by the Independent Directors on July 8.\n48\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 12, 2022, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Barth formally withdrawing the July 4 Company A Proposal, noting\nthat Company A had been unable to find a mutual agreement with the Company\u2019s management regarding \u201cchange of\ncontrol\u201d severance, management and employee retention and organizational structure, which agreement was a\ncondition to the July 4 Company A Proposal.\nAlso on July 12, 2022, representatives of the Company\u2019s management and senior members of Company D\u2019s\nmanagement team held an in-person meeting to review a management presentation on the Company\u2019s business,\nwhich included the \u201cBase Case\u201d and \u201cHigh Case\u201d Financial Forecasts that had previously been shared with TD and\nCompany A. During this meeting, the representatives of Company D expressed interest in the strategic rationale for\nan acquisition of the Company, which Company management and Company D\u2019s management discussed further over\ndinner.\nOn July 13, 2022, Mr. Barth contacted a representative of Company A to discuss Company A\u2019s withdrawal letter on\nbehalf of the Independent Directors, and to explore if there was any path forward given the issues related to\norganizational structure and management retention. The representative of Company A informed Mr. Barth that there\nwere a number of issues that would make an acquisition of the Company impracticable for Company A. The\nrepresentative of Company A noted that Company A had concerns with the cultural fit of the two organizations,\nincluding substantial differences in the compensation structures for non-management employees (and difficulty in\nintegrating the Company\u2019s compensation practices based on an aggregate compensation-to-revenue target into\nCompany A\u2019s larger organization) and overlapping businesses and management roles, which, in Company A\u2019s view,\ncreated difficulties in creating a viable leadership structure and reporting lines for the combined organization. The\nrepresentative of Company A also noted that Company A was not willing to pay the Company\u2019s management the\nexisting \u201cchange of control\u201d severance entitlements and was not willing, in lieu of such severance entitlements, to\npay retention compensation inconsistent with the compensation rates used in Company A\u2019s business.\nOn July 13, 2022 and July 14, 2022, representatives of the Company\u2019s management and Company D held numerous\ndue diligence calls.\nOn July 13, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer of Company C contacted Mr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that,\ngiven Company C\u2019s focus on other strategic priorities, Company C would not be pursuing a transaction with the\nCompany at that time.\nAlso on July 13, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher shared a revised draft merger agreement with\nrepresentatives of Cravath, which included, among other things, a proposed company termination fee of 3.5% of\ntransaction equity value, an indication that a potential condition to TD\u2019s obligations to close the merger related to\nfund consents remained subject to due diligence, and a reinsertion of the previous limitation on TD\u2019s obligations to\ntake or agree to conditions or restrictions in connection with obtaining consents or approvals required in connection\nwith the merger to those that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably be expected\nto have a material and adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or TD and its\nsubsidiaries, taken as a whole (with TD deemed to be the same size as the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a\nwhole).\nOn July 14, 2022, a representative of Company D contacted a representative of Ardea, and informed Ardea that\nCompany D would need additional time to conduct due diligence and evaluate the cultural fit of the two businesses,\nand therefore would not be engaging further on a potential acquisition of the Company at such time. The\nrepresentative of Company D indicated that Company D would consider reengaging in discussions in August if the\nCompany were still available, but would need 30 to 45 days from that point to finalize diligence for a potential\ntransaction. A representative of Company D subsequently contacted a representative of Perkins Advisors on July 15,\n2022, and stated that Company D was concerned with potential leaks regarding a transaction involving the Company\nand therefore did not want to reengage until after both Company D and the Company had announced second quarter\nearnings.\nOn July 18, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Barth provided a\nsummary to the Board of his discussion with Company A on July 13, including his impression that it was clear, based\non that conversation, that Company A was not seriously interested in continuing to pursue a transaction with the\nCompany. Representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then provided a summary of their respective discussions\nwith representatives of Company D, noting Company D\u2019s position that it would not reengage until August. The\nBoard discussed that waiting to reengage with Company D and for Company D to begin due diligence in August\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwould create risks related to TD\u2019s bid, as TD had signaled a willingness to sign a transaction during July, and that, if\nCompany D were willing to pursue a transaction in the valuation range reflected in the July 8 Company D Proposal,\nCompany D would not be precluded under the merger agreement with TD from submitting a competing acquisition\nproposal prior to receipt of the stockholder approval of any transaction with TD. Mr. Solomon then provided an\nupdate on discussions with TD, noting that negotiations related to the merger agreement and individual employment\nagreements for the Executives were still ongoing. Mr. Solomon provided an overview of open issues in the individual\nemployment agreements for the Executives, including TD\u2019s proposal that the Executives\u2019 annual compensation would\nnot be subject to annual minimum guarantees. Representatives of Cravath then provided an overview of the revised\ndraft merger agreement that had been received from Simpson Thacher on July 18, 2022. After discussion, the\nIndependent Directors authorized Cravath to send a revised draft merger agreement to TD reflecting, among other\nthings, a proposed company termination fee of $35.0 million, the removal of any closing conditions based on fund\nconsents, and a \u201creverse termination fee\u201d of $100.0 million payable by TD to the Company upon the occurrence of\ncertain events, including the failure to close the transaction due to a denial of a required regulatory approval. The\nmembers of Company management then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive\nsession, with representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. During the\nexecutive session, the Independent Directors and advisors discussed the alternatives available to the Company. The\nIndependent Directors noted their understanding that neither Company A nor Company D was seriously interested in\npursuing a transaction with the Company at that time, and that TD\u2019s proposal was therefore the sole actionable\nacquisition proposal that the Board had received. The Independent Directors also noted that TD had already\ninvested substantial resources in due diligence, negotiations and legal expenses, and that TD\u2019s willingness to\nexecute a transaction quickly and on terms that offered substantial closing certainty were key features of TD\u2019s\nproposal. After discussion, the Independent Directors instructed the Company\u2019s advisors present to continue\nnegotiations with TD to attempt to finalize the terms of the proposed transaction as quickly as practicable, while\nseeking terms that would maximize closing certainty, not unreasonably foreclose competing acquisition proposals\nfrom being made by third parties and provide the Company with flexibility to retain employees between signing and\nclosing in order to minimize the harm to the Company\u2019s business if, contrary to the parties\u2019 then-current expectations,\nthe proposed transaction did not close. The Independent Directors also authorized the Company\u2019s management and\nArdea to share the full Financial Forecasts with TD, given that Perella Weinberg, as TD\u2019s financial advisor, had\nrequested confirmation as to whether any other projections prepared by the Company\u2019s management existed, beyond\nthe Base Case and High Case projections for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 which had been previously shared.\nOn July 20, 2022, representatives of Cravath shared a revised draft merger agreement with representatives of Simpson\nThacher reflecting the positions authorized by the Independent Directors on July 18.\nAlso on July 20, 2022, the Board held a regular quarterly meeting in person, with members of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement participating. During such meeting, the Board requested that representatives of Cravath, Ardea and\nPerkins Advisors join to discuss the status of the potential transaction with TD and other proposals. The Board\ndiscussed the fact that, while two other proposals had been submitted with a nominal value in excess of $39.00 per\nshare of common stock, both of those proposals had been subject to contingencies that had not been satisfied and\nwere not actionable (and, in the case of the Company A proposal, had been definitively withdrawn), and the TD\nproposal was the only remaining actionable proposal and offered the greatest combination of value and certainty.\nThe Board also discussed whether, based on the receipt of other competing proposals, the Company should request\nimprovements to the proposed transaction with TD. The members of Company management and the representatives\nof Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive\nsession, with representatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. During the executive session, the\nIndependent Directors determined that, the TD proposal was the best option reasonably available under the\ncircumstances at that time (and was advisable to the Company and its stockholders) and that, while TD had rejected\nrequests for an increase in the merger consideration above $39.00 per share of common stock on three prior\noccasions, TD likely had capacity to improve the terms of its proposal and instructed the Company\u2019s advisors to seek\nimprovements to the terms of TD\u2019s proposal.\nOn July 22, 2022, representatives of Cravath and Simpson Thacher had a call to discuss the draft merger agreement.\nDuring the call, the representatives of Simpson Thacher highlighted areas of concern for TD in the revised draft sent\non July 20, including that (i) TD was not willing to agree to a \u201chell or high water\u201d standard for TD\u2019s obligations to\nseek all required regulatory approvals or a reverse termination fee in the event that any required regulatory approvals\ncannot be obtained, (ii) TD was not willing to agree to any restrictions on TD\u2019s ability to close TD\u2019s pending\nacquisition of First Horizon Corporation, (iii) TD wanted the Company to pursue a\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrestructuring to obviate the need for any NRC Approval or DFS Approval (each as defined in the section entitled\n\u201cThe Merger-Regulatory Approvals in Connection with the Merger\u201d beginning on page 80 of this proxy statement)\nand (iv) TD would require a closing condition based on receipt of any required material fund consents.\nLater on July 22, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives\nof Cravath reflecting the positions previously communicated, as well as a proposed company termination fee of\n$42.25 million.\nAlso on July 22, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s\nmanagement and representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Mr. Solomon\nprovided an update on discussions with TD, noting that progress had been made on the individual employment\nagreements and broader employee retention issues in the draft merger agreement, as well as post-closing\ncompensation structures for the remaining employees to ensure the success of the combined business and retention\nof employees prior to closing the potential transaction. Representatives of Cravath then reviewed with the Board the\nopen issues in the merger agreement, including the issues that Simpson Thacher had raised on the call with Cravath\nearlier in the day. After discussion, the Independent Directors authorized Cravath to respond to Simpson Thacher\nthat, in order for TD\u2019s proposal to continue to be the most favorable option reasonably available to the Company\u2019s\nstockholders under the circumstances, TD would need to improve deal certainty, including that (i) there would be\neither a \u201chell or high water\u201d standard for TD\u2019s obligations to seek all required regulatory approvals or a reverse\ntermination fee of $100.0 million payable by TD in the event that any required regulatory approvals cannot be\nobtained, (ii) TD would be required to seek the NRC Approval or DFS Approval, as applicable, if a restructuring or\ndisposition of the relevant assets could not be timely implemented and (iii) the transaction would not be conditioned\nupon receipt of any non-governmental third-party consents, including fund consents. The members of Company\nmanagement and the representatives of Ardea and Perkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent\nDirectors commenced an executive session, with representatives of Cravath participating. After discussion, the\nIndependent Directors determined that, given the open issues in the merger agreement and TD\u2019s prior rejection of\nany price improvements above $39.00 per share of common stock, the best way to improve the terms of TD\u2019s current\nproposal was to maximize deal certainty in the merger agreement, particularly given the potential harm to the\nCompany\u2019s business and employee retention in the event that a definitive agreement was signed and announced but\nthe proposed transaction failed to close.\nOver the next several days, the Company and TD exchanged multiple drafts of the merger agreement and issues lists,\nand representatives of Cravath and Simpson Thacher had numerous discussions to resolve the open issues in the\nmerger agreement. During these discussions, TD proposed that, in lieu of a \u201chell or high water\u2019 standard for TD\u2019s\nobligations to seek all required regulatory approvals or a reverse termination fee of $100.0 million payable by TD in\nthe event that any required regulatory approvals cannot be obtained, the Company would be entitled to expense\nreimbursement from TD (which we refer to as the \u201cexpense reimbursement\u201d) in the event that any required regulatory\napprovals cannot be obtained, including (i) $10.0 million for fees and expenses, (ii) the aggregate face amount of\nemployee retention awards which have been allocated and communicated to employees (subject to certain limitations\nand requirements) and (iii) the designated capped amount for the premium of an insurance policy that may, at the\nrequest of TD, be bound by the Company pursuant to the merger agreement.\nOn July 27, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating. Representatives of\nCravath reviewed with the Board the updated terms of the draft merger agreement, including the proposed expense\nreimbursement. The representatives of Cravath noted that, if the parties agreed on mutually satisfactory language\nand triggers for the expense reimbursement, the provision would provide for an expense reimbursement payment of\n$100.0 million and would therefore be substantively similar to the $100.0 million reverse termination fee previously\nproposed by the Independent Directors. After discussion, the Independent Directors authorized representatives of\nCravath to finalize a draft of the merger agreement reflecting the proposed expense reimbursement, pending final\nBoard approval at a subsequent meeting. The members of Company management and representatives of Ardea and\nPerkins Advisors then exited the meeting and the Independent Directors commenced an executive session, with\nrepresentatives of Cravath and Morris Nichols participating. Mr. Barth informed the Independent Directors that\nArdea had requested that the Independent Directors reaffirm or update the Weightings prior to Ardea delivering a\nfairness opinion to the Board in connection with the proposed transaction. At the request of the Independent\nDirectors,\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMr. Solomon then rejoined the meeting to provide the Independent Directors with an update on the Company\u2019s\nresults to date and progress compared to the Financial Forecasts. Mr. Solomon noted that, while conditions in the\nfinancial markets had improved and the Company\u2019s performance had been improving in recent weeks, based on the\nCompany\u2019s then-current revenue run-rate, management expected revenue for the full year in 2022 to fall below the\nBase Case, and that, while the Base Case may be attainable in future periods, the Company was facing continued\nheadwinds in the industries in which it operates, and therefore management\u2019s estimates of the Company\u2019s future\nfinancial performance had not changed. Mr. Solomon then exited the meeting. After discussion, the Independent\nDirectors reaffirmed the Weightings, and authorized Mr. Barth to instruct Ardea to utilize the Weightings for\npurposes of any fairness opinion.\nAfter the Board meeting on July 27, 2022, representatives of the Company, TD, Cravath and Simpson Thacher\ndiscussed and exchanged comments to the draft merger agreement, and the Executives and representatives of TD and\nSimpson Thacher discussed and exchanged comments to the draft employment agreements between the Executives\nand TD. At the conclusion of these discussions, the parties had agreed on the material terms of the merger\nagreement. The Executives and TD had also agreed on the material terms of the Executives\u2019 employment agreements,\nwhich terms were consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle reached on June 30, 2022, including waiving\ntheir rights under their existing \u201cchange of control\u201d severance agreements. For a detailed discussion of the material\nterms of the Executives\u2019 employment arrangements, including severance and retention entitlements, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d beginning on page\n70 of this proxy statement.\nOn July 28, 2022, the Board held a meeting by videoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management\nand representatives of Cravath, Morris Nichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating for the purpose of\nreviewing the proposed transaction with TD. Representatives of Cravath reviewed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in\nconnection with its consideration of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Ardea began to review its financial\nanalysis of the merger consideration of $39.00 per share of common stock. During such review, Mr. Ahmed contacted\nMr. Solomon and informed Mr. Solomon that, due to a few remaining outstanding due diligence items, TD would need\nuntil the beginning of the next week in order to finalize its due diligence and sign the definitive merger agreement.\nAfter discussion, the Board instructed management to facilitate TD\u2019s remaining due diligence and to finalize the terms\nof the merger agreement and the Executives\u2019 employment agreements, and determined to reconvene a Board meeting\nonce such due diligence was completed.\nBetween July 28, 2022 and August 1, 2022, the parties held numerous discussions regarding due diligence and the\nmerger agreement. On August 1, following completion of such due diligence, the Board held a meeting by\nvideoconference, with representatives of the Company\u2019s management and representatives of Cravath, Morris\nNichols, Ardea and Perkins Advisors participating for the purpose of reviewing the proposed transaction with TD.\nRepresentatives of Cravath reviewed the Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in connection with its consideration of the\nproposed transaction. Representatives of Ardea reviewed its financial analysis of the merger consideration of $39.00\nper share of common stock. Ardea then rendered to the Board an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of a written opinion dated August 1, 2022, that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and\nsubject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nreview undertaken by Ardea in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration of $39.00 per share of class A common\nstock to be paid to the holders of class A common stock (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the\nmerger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of Ardea\u2019s\nopinion, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Opinion of Ardea Partners LP\u201d beginning on page 64 of this proxy\nstatement. The written opinion delivered by Ardea is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex B. Representatives\nof Cravath then reviewed with the Board the terms of the proposed merger agreement, including the terms of the \u201cno\nshop\u201d provisions and the expense reimbursement provisions. Following additional discussion and consideration of\nthe proposed merger agreement and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the proposed merger\nagreement, the Board recessed and the Compensation Committee of the Board convened and unanimously approved\ncertain employment compensation and other employee benefit arrangements with respect to the employees of the\nCompany in connection with the proposed merger agreement, including the treatment of Company equity awards. For\na detailed discussion of the material terms of the Executives\u2019 employment arrangements, including severance and\nretention entitlements, see the section entitled \u201c-Interests of the Company\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement. Following such approval by the Compensation Committee of\nthe Board, the Board reconvened and unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the\nmerger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e (ii) determined that it is fair and advisable\nto, and\n52\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nin the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the\nmerger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e (iii) directed that the merger agreement be\nsubmitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption\u037e (iv) recommended that such stockholders vote their\nshares of common stock in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving the transactions contemplated\nthereby (including the merger)\u037e and (v) authorized the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the\nmerger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Board meeting, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement on August\n1, 2022.\nOn August 2, 2022, prior to the opening of trading on the Nasdaq, the parties issued a joint press release announcing\nthe merger.\nRecommendation of the Board\nAt the special meeting of the Board on August 1, 2022, after consideration, including the material factors described in\nthe section entitled \u201c-",

        "Section Text": "Reasons for the Merger\nAs described in the section above entitled \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 31 of this proxy\nstatement, prior to and in reaching its unanimous determination to (i) approve and declare advisable the merger\nagreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e (ii) determine that it is fair\nand advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders to enter into the merger agreement\nand consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement\u037e (iii) direct that the\nmerger agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption\u037e (iv) recommend that such\nstockholders vote their shares of common stock in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving the\ntransactions contemplated thereby (including the merger)\u037e and (v) authorize the execution, delivery and performance\nby the Company of the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Board consulted with and received the advice of its financial\nadvisors and outside counsel, discussed certain issues with the Company\u2019s management and considered a variety of\nfactors weighing positively in favor of the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding, among other things, the following non-exhaustive list of material factors (not necessarily in order of\nrelative importance):\n\u2022\nMerger Consideration\u037e Premium to the Trading Price of the Class A Common Stock. The Board\nconsidered the current and historical market prices of the class A common stock, including the market\nperformance of the class A common stock relative to those of other participants in the Company\u2019s industry\nand general market indices, and the fact that the $39.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the\nholders of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement represented:\n\u25cb\na premium of 49.0% to $26.18, the closing price on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to TD\u2019s initial\nverbal offer of $39.00 per share in cash\u037e\n53TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u25cb\na premium of 62.2% to $24.04, the closing price on July 1, 2022, the last trading day prior to public\nspeculation of a potential transaction between the Company and TD\u037e and\n\u25cb\na discount of 7.1% to $41.97, the highest closing price during the 52-week period ending July 1, 2022,\nthe last trading day prior to public speculation of a potential transaction between the Company and\nTD.\n\u2022\nCash Consideration\u037e Certainty of Value and Liquidity. The Board considered the fact that the merger\nconsideration is all cash, which will provide the Company stockholders immediate certainty of value and\nliquidity for their shares of common stock, enables the Company stockholders to realize value that has been\ncreated by the Company and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or\nmacroeconomic conditions, as compared to the Company remaining independent (especially when viewed\nagainst the potential risks and uncertainties inherent in the Company\u2019s businesses, including risks related\nto an adverse macroeconomic environment and a prolonged market downturn). The Board also considered\nthat, given the impact of macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the broader financial markets on the\nCompany\u2019s business and financial prospects, the Board believed that, on an unaffected basis independent\nof the announcement of a strategic transaction, the share price of the class A common stock was not likely\nto trade at or above the merger consideration in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nNo Financing Condition. The Board considered the fact that TD and Merger Sub would have sufficient\ncash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid under the merger agreement without obtaining third-\nparty financing and that the merger is not subject to a financing condition.\n\u2022\nSale Process. The Board considered the fact that it regularly reviewed the Company\u2019s performance and\nprospects in light of its business and developments in the financial services industry and the\nmacroeconomic environment, including reviews of potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic\ntransactions to enhance stockholder value, and that the Board, the Company\u2019s management and\nrepresentatives of the Company\u2019s financial advisors and outside counsel had engaged in extensive\ndiscussions regarding potential strategic partnerships with other companies in the financial services\nindustry and their financial advisors and outside counsel over an extended period of time. In particular, the\nprocess conducted by the Board, with the assistance of the Company\u2019s financial advisors and outside\ncounsel, involved contacting, or responding to, five potential acquirors (including TD) and their respective\nfinancial advisors, entering into mutual confidentiality agreements with, providing management\npresentations to, attending numerous calls and meetings with representatives of, and granting due\ndiligence access to, three potential acquirors (including TD), receiving non-binding offers (and negotiating\ntowards receiving binding offers) from three potential acquirors (including TD), and receiving one final\nbinding offer from TD. The Board also considered the fact that, while the media coverage regarding the\nrumor that TD was exploring an acquisition of the Company resulted in the initial outreach by two of the\nfive potential acquirors (Company B and Company C), neither of the two potential acquirors seriously\npursued the opportunity to explore a potential acquisition of or other strategic partnership with the\nCompany. The Board also considered that, while Company A and Company D had submitted non-binding\nindications of interest with potential consideration per share in excess of $39.00 per share of common stock,\nsuch indications of interest were preliminary, were subject to contingencies that had not been satisfied and\nhad subsequently been withdrawn, and neither Company A nor Company D had expressed further interest\nin a transaction involving the Company after such withdrawals (and that Company D had not subsequently\nattempted to re-engage with the Company after the announcement of Company D\u2019s quarterly earnings). For\na detailed discussion of the sale process, see the section entitled \u201c-Background of the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 31 of this proxy statement.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Operating and Financial Condition and Outlook. The Board considered the Company\u2019s\noperating and financial performance and outlook, including a \u201cLow Case\u201d, \u201cBase Case\u201d and \u201cHigh Case\u201d\nfor fiscal years 2022 through 2026 prepared by management, which forecasts are described in more detail in\nthe section entitled \u201c-",

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Ardea Partners LP\nPursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Ardea dated June 28, 2022, the Company retained Ardea\nas its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nAt a meeting of the Board held on August 1, 2022, representatives of Ardea rendered to the Board Ardea\u2019s oral\nopinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated August 1, 2022 and delivered to the Board, to the effect\nthat, as of the date of Ardea\u2019s written opinion, and based upon, and subject to, the factors and assumptions set forth\ntherein, the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock, without interest, to be paid to the holders of shares of\nclass A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders.\nThe full text of Ardea\u2019s written opinion, dated August 1, 2022, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the scope of review undertaken in connection\nwith the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The summary of the Ardea opinion contained in\nthis proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Ardea\u2019s written opinion. Cowen\nstockholders are urged to, and should, read the Ardea opinion carefully and in its entirety.

Ardea also assumed that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be\nconsummated on the terms set forth therein, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition therein, the\neffect of which would be in any way meaningful to Ardea\u2019s analysis.\nArdea\u2019s opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, the relative merits of such transactions as compared to any strategic\nalternatives that may be available to the Company, or any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Ardea\u2019s opinion\naddresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of class A common stock, as of the\ndate of the opinion, of the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to\nthe terms of the merger agreement.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a\ncomplete description of the financial analyses performed by Ardea, nor does the order of analyses described\nrepresent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Ardea.\nParts of the below summary include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with\nthe full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Ardea\u2019s financial analyses. Except as\notherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on\nmarket data as it existed on or before July 29, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\n65\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nImplied Acquisition Premia and Multiples\nImplied Acquisition Premia. Ardea calculated that the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock to be paid to\nthe holders of shares of class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement represented:\n\u2022\na premium of 49.0% to the closing price on June 3, 2022, the last trading day prior to TD\u2019s initial verbal offer\nof $39.00 per share in cash\u037e\n\u2022\na premium of 62.2% to $24.04, the closing price as of July 1, 2022, the last closing price prior to public\nspeculation of a potential transaction between the Company and TD\u037e and\n\u2022\na discount of 7.1% to the highest closing price during the 52-week period ending July 1, 2022, the last\nclosing price prior to public speculation of a potential transaction between the Company and TD.\nImplied Multiples. Ardea calculated the $39.00 in cash per share of class A common stock to be paid to the holders of\nshares of class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement as a multiple of:\n\u2022\nthe estimated weighted management economic operating income per diluted share (or EOI/Share) for the\nCompany for 2022 and 2023 based on the Financial Forecasts and Weightings\u037e\n\u2022\nthe consensus median 2022 EOI/Share and 2023 EOI/Share estimates for the Company published by FactSet\nas of July 29, 2022\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe book value per basic share (or P/BV), as of March 31, 2022, as stated in the Company\u2019s earnings release\nof April 29, 2022\u037e\nThe results of these analyses are summarized as follows:\nImplied Multiples to:\n2022E Weighted Management EOI/Share\n9.2x\n2022E Consensus Median EOI/Share from FactSet\n10.1x\n2023E Weighted Management EOI/Share\n6.7x\n2023E Consensus Median EOI/Share from FactSet\n6.5x\nBook Value per share\n1.0x\nValuation Analyses\n1. Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nArdea performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company using the Financial Forecasts and the\nWeightings. Using the mid-year convention for discounting and illustrative discount rates ranging from 10.5% to\n11.5%, which reflect estimates of the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital on a standalone basis derived by\napplication of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (or CAPM), Ardea discounted to present value as of March 31, 2022\n(i) estimates of unlevered free cash flows for the Company for the nine months ending December 31, 2022 and the\nyears 2023 through 2026 for each of the cases in the Financial Forecasts and (ii) illustrative terminal values for the\nCompany as of December 31, 2026 derived by applying illustrative terminal multiples, ranging from 4.0x to 6.0x to 2026\nestimated unlevered economic operating income for each of the cases in the Financial Forecasts. For each of the\ncases in the Financial Forecasts, Ardea derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding\nthe range of present values it derived as described above for the period from March 31, 2022 through December 31,\n2026 to the range of present values of the illustrative terminal values it derived as described above for such case.\nArdea then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the amount of net\ndebt of the Company as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of the Company and approved for Ardea\u2019s\nuse by the management of the Company, to calculate a range of illustrative implied equity values of the Company as\nof March 31, 2022. Ardea then divided the range of illustrative implied equity values by the total number of shares of\nclass A common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of March 31, 2022, as provided by management of the\nCompany, for each case in the Financial Forecasts (reflecting the preferred stock as debt in the Low Case Financial\nForecast in cases where the face value of the security would exceed the as-converted value, inclusive of any \u201cmake-\nwhole\u201d, and in all other cases on an as-converted basis, inclusive of any \u201cmake-whole\u201d) to calculate an illustrative\nrange of implied per-share equity values for each case. Ardea then applied the Weightings to such illustrative ranges\nof per-share\n66\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nequity values to derive an illustrative range of implied weighted per-share equity values based on the Financial\nForecasts and the Weightings, which analysis resulted in an illustrative range of present values per share of class A\ncommon stock of $34 to $44 (all values rounded to the nearest dollar).\n2. Illustrative Present Value of Future Stock Price and Dividends Analysis\nArdea performed an analysis to derive an illustrative range of implied present values per share of class A common\nstock on a standalone basis, based on implied future values calculated by Ardea for shares of class A common stock\nusing the Financial Forecasts and Weightings.\nArdea calculated an illustrative range of implied present values per share of class A common stock as of March 31,\n2022 based on hypothetical future stock prices for shares of class A common stock as of the end of each of the years\n2022 through 2025 and expected cumulative dividends based on the Financial Forecasts and Weightings. For\npurposes of this analysis, Ardea derived hypothetical future stock prices for class A common stock by applying\nmultiples ranging from 4.0x to 6.0x to the Company\u2019s weighted 1-year forward projected EOI/Share as of each of\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Ardea then discounted to present value these future stock\nprices and, using the mid-year discounting convention, the estimated dividends to be paid per share of class A\ncommon stock through the end of the applicable year to March 31, 2022, using a discount rate of 12.1%, reflecting an\nestimate of the Company\u2019s cost of equity derived by application of the CAPM. This analysis resulted in a range of\nillustrative implied present values per share of class A common stock of $19 to $32 (all values rounded to the nearest\ndollar).\n3. Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis\nArdea analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the selected acquisition transactions listed below\nsince 2012 with a value greater than $100.00 million involving target companies in the investment banking industry\nthat had product offerings that were similar to the product offerings of the Company.\nWhile none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Company\nand none of the selected transactions are directly comparable to the proposed merger, the selected transactions are\ntransactions that, in Ardea\u2019s professional judgment and experience, involved target companies with operations that,\nfor the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company\u2019s results, market size and product\nprofile.\nFor each of the selected transactions, Ardea calculated and compared the announced transaction value as (i) a\nmultiple of the target company\u2019s forward earnings, which we refer to as FY 1 P/E and (ii) a multiple of the target\ncompany\u2019s P/BV for the last quarterly period prior to the announcement date of the transaction. For each of the\nselected transactions (except for the acquisition of KBW, Inc.), forward earnings represents the FactSet estimate for\nthe target\u2019s diluted earnings per share (or EPS) for the first fiscal year ended following announcement of the\napplicable transaction. For the acquisition of KBW, Inc., forward earnings represents the target\u2019s four quarter period\nEPS beginning with the first quarter reported after the announcement of the applicable transaction.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nTransaction\nValue\nFY1 P/E\nP/BV\nNovember 5, 2012\nStifel Financial Corp.\nKBW, Inc.\n$0.6bn\n11.1x\n1.4x\nNovember 12, 2012\nLeucadia National\nCorporation\nJefferies Group, Inc.\n$3.8bn\n14.3x\n1.0x\nJuly 9, 2019\nPiper Jaffray Companies\nSandler O\u2019Neil +\nPartners, L.P.\n$0.5bn\nN/A\nN/A\nSeptember 8, 2021\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc.\nJMP Group LLC\n$0.1bn\n9.0x\n2.1x\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations and Ardea's analysis of the various transactions and its\nprofessional judgment, Ardea applied a reference range of FY1 P/E multiples of 9.0x to 14.3x to the estimated 2022\nEOI/Share of the Company, based on the Financial Forecasts and Weightings. This analysis resulted in an\n67\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nillustrative range of implied values of $38 to $61 per share of class A common stock (all values rounded to the nearest\ndollar). Ardea also applied a reference range of P/BV multiples of 1.0x to 2.1x to the book value per share as reported\nby the Company as of March 31, 2022. This analysis resulted in an illustrative range of implied values of $37 to $79\nper share of class A common stock (all values rounded to the nearest dollar).\n4. Historical Premia Analysis\nArdea reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data obtained from FactSet, the premia paid in all-cash\nacquisitions of publicly traded companies in the U.S. in the financial services industry (excluding real estate\ninvestment trusts), listed on the NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange, with transaction values greater than or equal\nto $500.00 million announced between January 1, 2012 and July 29, 2022. Ardea calculated the median, average and\n90th percentile of the values of premia of the price paid per share relative to the target company\u2019s last undisturbed\nclosing price prior to the announcement of the relevant transaction.\nThe following table represents the results of this analysis:\nMetric\nPremium\nMedian\n27.1%\nAverage\n34.1%\n90th Percentile\n58.3%\nArdea, based on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, applied a selected\nrange of premia from 27.1% to 58.3% to the closing price of class A common stock on July 1, 2022, of $24.04 to derive\na range of implied values per share of class A common stock of $31 to $38 (all values rounded to the nearest dollar).\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Ardea\u2019s opinion. In arriving at its\nfairness determination, Ardea considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight\nto any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Ardea made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its\nprofessional judgment and experience after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction\nused in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement.\nArdea prepared these analyses for purposes of Ardea providing its opinion to the Board that, as of the date of its\nopinion and based upon, and subject to, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations upon the scope of review undertaken by Ardea, the $39.00 in cash per share of class A\ncommon stock to be paid to the holders of shares of class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor\ndo they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon\nforecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being\nbased upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the\nCompany, Ardea or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those\nforecasted.\nThe transaction consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between the Company and TD and\nwas approved by the Board. Ardea provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Ardea did not,\nhowever, recommend any specific amount or type of consideration to the Company or the Board or that any specific\namount or type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement.\nAs described above, Ardea\u2019s opinion to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board in\nmaking its determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The foregoing\nsummary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Ardea in connection with the\nfairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Ardea attached as Annex B to\nthis proxy statement.\n68\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nArdea is engaged in merger and acquisition advisory services, investment banking, underwriting services, private\nplacements of securities and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.\nArdea and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other\neconomic interest or with which they co-invest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell, hold or vote\nlong or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default\nswaps and other financial instruments of the Company, TD, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any\ncurrency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Ardea acted\nas financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement. During the two-year period ended August 1, 2022, Ardea has\nnot been engaged by the Company and/or TD and/or their respective affiliates to provide financial advisory,\nunderwriting and/or other financial and non-financial services for which Ardea has recognized compensation. Ardea\nmay in the future provide financial advisory, underwriting and/or other financial and non-financial services to the\nCompany, TD and their respective affiliates for which Ardea may receive compensation.\nThe Board selected Ardea as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm\nthat has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nPursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Ardea dated June 28, 2022, the Company retained Ardea\nas its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In connection\nwith the transaction, Ardea will receive financial advisory fees from the Company estimated, based on the information\navailable as of the date of the announcement, to be approximately $22.9 million, $2 million of which became payable\nupon the announcement of the merger and the remainder of which is payable contingent upon the completion of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Further, the Company has agreed to reimburse Ardea for certain\nof its expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and disbursements and to indemnify Ardea and related persons\nagainst various liabilities, including certain liabilities under federal securities laws.",

As of the date hereof, the\nCompany has not yet approved any specific actions to mitigate the expected impact of Section 280G of the Code on\nthe Company and any disqualified individuals. No Executive is entitled to receive gross-ups or tax reimbursements\nfrom the Company with respect to any potential excise taxes.\nDirector and Officer Indemnification\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Board and the executive officers will be entitled to\ncertain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies following the\nmerger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the merger agreement relating to director and officer\nindemnification, see the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-Indemnification\u201d\nbeginning on page 102 of this proxy statement.\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth for each of the Company\u2019s named\nexecutive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger for\nwhich payment is not conditioned upon a termination or resignation of such named executive officer (i.e., on a\n\u201csingle-trigger\u201d basis) or in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following the merger (i.e., on a\n\u201cdouble-trigger\u201d basis). The holders of shares of common stock are being asked to approve, on a non-binding,\nadvisory basis, such compensation. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be\nbinding on either the Company, the Board, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Accordingly, if the merger proposal is\napproved by the holders of shares of common stock and the merger is consummated, the compensation will be\npayable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions\napplicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the tables below and above under \u201c-Interests of the\nCompany\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u201d.\nThe potential payments in the tables below are quantified in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The\nestimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the merger is consummated on January 31, 2023, (ii) the per\nshare merger consideration of $39.00, (iii) each named executive officer\u2019s Executive Employment Agreement being\neffective, (iv) the number of unvested Company compensation awards held by the named executive officers as of\nimmediately prior to January 31, 2023, and assuming no additional grants or forfeitures of Company compensation\nawards prior to January 31, 2023, and (v) an assumption that each named executive officer experiences a termination\nof employment without \u201ccause\u201d immediately following the consummation of the merger. As such, the amounts\nindicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including\nassumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur\nbefore consummation of the merger. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive\nofficer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.\n76\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs further detailed below, and in each case, subject to the assumptions set forth in the paragraph immediately above,\n(i) the amounts quantified in the \u201cEquity\u201d column and with respect to the Company DCAs component in the \u201cCash\u201d\ncolumn represent arrangements that existed between the Company and the Executives prior to the entry into the\nmerger agreement (the total amounts for such existing arrangements in the aggregate for each of Messrs. Solomon,\nHolmes, Lasota and Littman equal approximately (in thousands) $26,158, $3,222, $2,973 and $3,006, respectively), and\n(ii) the amounts quantified with respect to the Severance Benefit in the \u201cCash\u201d column represent arrangements\nentered into in connection with the consummation of the merger, and which are payable in connection with a\ntermination without \u201ccause\u201d in the 2023 fiscal year. The amounts shown below do not attempt to quantify any\nreduction that may be required as a result of a 280G best-net cutback, which all named executive officers are subject\nto\u037e therefore, actual payments to the named executive officers may be substantially less than the amounts indicated\nbelow.\nPotential Payments to Named Executive Officers ($)(In Thousands)\nName\nCash(1)\nEquity(2)\nPerquisites/\nBenefits(3)\nTotal\nJeffrey Solomon\n58,719\n17,856\n99\n76,674\nJohn Holmes\n13,671\n2,491\n44\n16,206\nStephen Lasota\n12,104\n2,309\n46\n14,459\nOwen Littman\n12,116\n2,330\n67\n14,513\n(1)\nThe amounts shown in this column represent the estimated value of (i) the severance benefits attributable to base salary and\nannual variable compensation (assuming the applicable fiscal year ends on December 31 and a termination without \u201ccause\u201d\nimmediately following the consummation of the merger), (ii) the Retention Bonus and Integration Bonus (if applicable), and (iii)\nunvested Company DCAs previously granted in respect of compensation for prior years as of immediately prior to the closing of\nthe merger, in each case, pursuant to the terms of each named executive officer\u2019s Executive Employment Agreement. If such\nexecutive\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d in the 2023 fiscal year, Mr. Solomon is entitled to a severance benefit\nequal to 50% of the sum of (A) the minimum amount attributable to his 2023 annual variable compensation and (B) his annual\nbase salary for the 2023 fiscal year, minus base salary paid for the 2023 fiscal year through the termination date, and each of\nMessrs.

Without limiting the indemnification and other rights\nprovided in this paragraph, all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the Cowen\nindemnified parties as provided in any indemnification agreement in existence on the date of the merger agreement\nwill survive the merger and will continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law, and will be\nhonored by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries or their respective successors as if they were the\nindemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment thereto.\nFor a period of six years after the effective time, TD or the Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained in effect\nthe current policies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by Cowen (provided, that TD or the\nSurviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same\ncoverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Cowen indemnified\nparties) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Cowen or any of its\nsubsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the effective time (including the approval of the\nmerger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement)\u037e provided, however, that the\nSurviving Corporation will not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the\ncurrent annual premium paid as of August 1, 2022, by Cowen for such insurance (the \u201cpremium cap\u201d) and if such\npremiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the premium cap, then TD or the Surviving Corporation will\ncause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in TD\u2019s or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s good faith determination,\nprovide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, TD\n(or Cowen, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of TD) may (and at the request of TD, Cowen will use its\nreasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the effective time a six-year \u201ctail\u201d policy under Cowen existing\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if\nand to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the premium\ncap.\nThe obligations of TD and the Surviving Corporation under the section of the merger agreement related to\nindemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance will not be terminated or modified after the effective time in a\nmanner so as to adversely affect any Cowen indemnified party or any other person entitled to the benefit of the\nsection of the merger agreement related to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance without the prior\nwritten consent of the affected Cowen indemnified party or affected person.\n102\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe provisions of the section of the merger agreement related to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019\ninsurance will survive the effective time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each\nCowen indemnified party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation, or any of its\nsuccessors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or Surviving\nCorporation of such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all its assets to any other entity or engages\nin any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that\nthe successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in the\nsection of the merger agreement related to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance.\nAdvice of Changes\nEach of TD and Cowen will promptly advise the other of any effect, fact, change, event, circumstance, condition,\noccurrence or development:\n\u2022\nthat has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a parent\nmaterial adverse effect or company material adverse effect, respectively\u037e or\n\u2022\nthat such first party believes would or would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material\nbreach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the\nmerger agreement or to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in the merger\nagreement.\nProvided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach of the merger\nagreement will not be deemed to constitute a violation of the section of the merger agreement relating to advice of\nchanges, provide a basis for terminating the merger agreement or constitute the failure of certain conditions set forth\nin the merger agreement to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of the merger agreement by the party failing\nto give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of certain\nconditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied\u037e and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice\npursuant to the section of the merger agreement relating to advice of changes will not cure any breach of, or\nnoncompliance with, any other provision of the merger agreement or limit the remedies available to the party\nreceiving such notice.\nStockholder Litigation\nEach party will give the other party prompt written notice of any stockholder litigation against such party or its\ndirectors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Cowen will:\n\u2022\ngive TD the opportunity to participate (at TD\u2019s expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation\u037e\n\u2022\ngive TD reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by Cowen in\nconnection with any such litigation, and consider in good faith TD\u2019s comments\u037e and\n\u2022\nnot agree to settle any such litigation without TD\u2019s prior written consent, which consent will not be\nunreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\nProvided, that TD will not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of TD and\nits affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after the effective time upon the Surviving\nCorporation or any of its affiliates.\nPublic Announcements\nEach of the parties agrees that no press release or other public announcement or statement concerning the merger\nagreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be issued by any party without the prior\nwritten consent of the other party (not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except:\n\u2022\nas required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable governmental entity or stock\nexchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the press release\nor other public announcement or statement will consult with the other party about, and allow the other\nparty reasonable time to comment on, such release, announcement or statement in advance of such\nissuance\u037e\n103\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nfor such releases, announcements or statements that are consistent with other such releases,\nannouncement or statements made after the date of the merger agreement in compliance with the section of\nthe merger agreement related to public announcements\u037e or\n\u2022\nby Cowen in connection with or following a recommendation change or its entry into an alternative\nacquisition agreement in response to a superior proposal.\nChange of Method\nTD will be empowered, at any time prior to the effective time, to change the method or structure of effecting the\ncombination of Cowen and TD, and, if and to the extent requested by TD, Cowen will agree to enter into such\namendments to the merger agreement as TD may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring\u037e\nprovided, however, that no such change or requested action will:\n\u2022\nalter or change the merger consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nreasonably be expected to have a non-de minimis adverse tax or other economic consequence to Cowen or\nany of its subsidiaries as compared to the method or structure of effecting such combination as reflected in\nthe merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreasonably be expected to have an adverse tax or other economic consequence to the stockholders of\nCowen as compared to the method or structure of effecting such combination as reflected in the merger\nagreement\u037e\n\u2022\nrequire a vote by or approval of the holders of common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ninclude a change from a one-step merger to a tender offer\u037e or\n\u2022\nmaterially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in\na timely manner.\nTakeover Statute\nNeither Cowen nor the Board will take any action within its control that would cause the restrictions of any takeover\nstatute to become applicable to the merger agreement, the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement, and each will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued\nexemption of) the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from the restrictions of\nany applicable takeover statute in effect on August 1, 2022, or thereafter. If any takeover statute may become, or may\npurport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, each party and its board of\ndirectors will grant such approvals and take such actions within its control as are necessary so that the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated\nthereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any takeover statute on any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such\ntakeover statute.\nTreatment of Cowen Indebtedness and Other Securities\nAt TD\u2019s written request and at TD\u2019s sole expense, Cowen will reasonably cooperate with, and provide reasonable\nassistance to, TD in connection with any steps TD may determine are necessary or desirable to take to retire, repay,\ndefease, repurchase, redeem, satisfy and discharge, cancel or otherwise terminate effective at or after the effective\ntime, some or all amounts outstanding under (i) the credit agreement, (ii) the indenture, (iii) the note purchase\nagreement and (iv) any other indebtedness of Cowen or its subsidiaries (including any indebtedness that replaces\nthe foregoing), which cooperation and assistance will include (A) arranging for (1) the optional redemption,\nsatisfaction and discharge, defeasance, exchange or other repurchase by TD, any of TD\u2019s subsidiaries, Cowen or any\nCowen subsidiary of, or a tender offer by TD, any of TD\u2019s subsidiaries, Cowen or any Cowen subsidiary for, some or\nall of the notes issued pursuant to the indenture or note purchase agreement and (2) the repayment or prepayment of\nany amounts outstanding under the credit agreement on or after the closing date, including, in the case of each of\nclauses (1) and (2), by preparing and submitting, prior to the closing date as instructed by TD, customary notices\n(subject to reasonable review and comment by Cowen) in respect of any such redemption, satisfaction and discharge,\ndefeasance, exchange, other repurchase, tender offer or repayment or prepayment\u037e provided that the consummation\nof any such redemption, satisfaction and discharge, defeasance, exchange offer, other repurchase, tender offer or\nrepayment or prepayment will be contingent upon\n104\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(and only occur after, or concurrently with, but not prior to) the occurrence of the effective time unless otherwise\nagreed in writing by Cowen, and (B) obtaining from the applicable lenders or agents customary payoff letters, lien\nand guarantee releases or instruments of termination or discharge in respect of the existing indebtedness of Cowen\nand its subsidiaries, including in respect of indebtedness under the credit agreement, the indenture and the note\npurchase agreement. At TD\u2019s written request and at TD\u2019s sole expense, Cowen will reasonably cooperate with, and\nprovide reasonable assistance to, TD in connection any communications with holders of preferred stock to provide\ninformation to such holders regarding how to elect to convert such shares of preferred stock following closing, and,\nat TD\u2019s election, Cowen will elect to mandatorily convert such preferred stock (provided that such conversion is\nconditioned upon, or is effective only at or after, the effective time) if permitted pursuant to the certificate of\ndesignation\u037e provided that Cowen\u2019s obligation to cooperate and assist in connection with communications to holders\nof preferred stock will not require Cowen to instruct, encourage or endorse any conversion of shares of preferred\nstock. TD will indemnify Cowen, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives, to the fullest extent\npermitted by applicable law, for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages or losses incurred in connection with\nthe section of the merger agreement related to treatment of Cowen indebtedness and other securities (other than with\nrespect to information regarding Cowen provided in writing by Cowen in connection therewith).\nExemption from Liability Under Rule 16b-3\nPrior to the effective time, TD and Cowen will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any\ndisposition of shares of common stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of\ncommon stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be\nexempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nAdvisory Contract Consents and Fund Matters\nCowen will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain with respect to each client\n(including, for the avoidance of doubt, each fund), in accordance with, and to the extent required by, applicable law or\nthe applicable company investment advisory contract or fund documentation, as applicable, as promptly as\nreasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement, (i) the consent of such client (or the investors therein),\nas applicable, for which consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of the applicable company investment\nadvisory contract is required by applicable law or by such company investment advisory contract or such fund\ndocumentation as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) any additional consent\nrequired from such client (or the investors therein), as applicable, in connection with the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement. Without the prior written consent of TD, Cowen will not, and will not permit any of its\nsubsidiaries to, make any payment to, or grant any other economic concession (including any obligation of Cowen,\nany Cowen subsidiary or TD or any of their respective affiliates to make any payment or assume or incur any other\nobligation or liability) to, any client (or investors therein) in order to obtain (or otherwise in connection with) any\nsuch consent.\nApproval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub\nFollowing execution of the merger agreement, TD executed and delivered to Cowen, in accordance with applicable law\nand the constituent documents of Merger Sub, in TD\u2019s capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent\nadopting the merger agreement and approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the\nmerger).\nCertain Assets\nCowen will keep TD apprised of any material developments on a reasonably current basis regarding the status of any\ndivestiture efforts with respect to certain assets or any other business (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be\nsubject to TD\u2019s consent rights set forth in the section of the merger agreement related to Cowen forbearances with\nrespect thereto, as applicable) and reasonably consult with TD in connection with any such divestiture.\nPre-Closing BHC Act Preparation\nPrior to the closing, Cowen will reasonably cooperate with TD (including providing Parent such information as may\nbe reasonably requested in accordance with the section of the merger agreement related to access to information) to\ndevelop a plan for bringing any assets, investments, commitments, activities or transactions of\n105\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCowen or its subsidiaries in compliance with the BHC Act, including the Volcker Rule, upon and following the\neffective time, including reasonably cooperating with TD in preparing amendments to the governing documents of\nany entity that will, from and after the effective time, be controlled or be deemed to be controlled, directly or\nindirectly, by TD within the meaning of the BHC Act (as reasonably determined by TD in its discretion) to include\nprovisions relating to the compliance, reporting and other regulatory obligations that would be applicable to such\nentities as a result of being so controlled or deemed to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by TD\u037e provided that\nCowen will not be required to commence any implementation of such plan (including not being required to adopt any\nsuch amendments) prior to the effective time.\nInsurance Policy\nAt the written request of TD, Cowen will use reasonable best efforts to bind (or, if TD seeks to bind a policy on\nbehalf of Cowen, to reasonably cooperate with TD binding), an insurance policy (the \u201cstop loss policy\u201d) with (a)\ncertain specified terms or such other terms as may be reasonably requested by TD and (b) a premium not to exceed\n$30,000,000.00 (the \u201creimbursable premium amount\u201d). In the event the merger agreement is terminated (other than in\nthe case of termination by TD pursuant to the fourth bullet set forth under the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 110 of this proxy statement or under\ncircumstances in which the TD expense reimbursement is payable and has been paid by TD), then TD will promptly\nreimburse Cowen for the premium paid with respect to such stop loss policy and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs\nincurred by Cowen in connection with binding such insurance policy, net of any amounts actually received (or which\nCowen is contractually entitled to receive) in connection with the cancellation or commutation of the stop loss policy.\nNon-Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals\nFrom the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement and the effective\ntime of the merger, Cowen is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit third-party proposals relating to\nalternative transactions or to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party in\nrelation to an alternative transaction. Specifically, Cowen will, and will cause its subsidiaries and their respective\nemployees, officers and directors to (and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other representatives\nto), immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or negotiations conducted before\nAugust 1, 2022 with any person other than TD with respect to any acquisition proposal (as defined in the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-No Change in Board Recommendation\u037e Alternative\nAcquisition Agreements and Intervening Events\u201d beginning on page 107 of this proxy statement).\nCowen will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective employees, officers and directors not to,\nand will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:\n\u2022\ninitiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any\nacquisition proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nengage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any acquisition proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with,\nany person relating to any acquisition proposal (except (A) to notify a person that has made or, to the\nknowledge of such party, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an acquisition\nproposal, of the existence of the section of the merger agreement related to non-solicitation obligations or\n(B) to clarify the terms and conditions of any acquisition proposal)\u037e or\n\u2022\nunless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any\nterm sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition\nagreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding)\n(other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the section of the\nmerger agreement relating to acquisition proposals) in connection with or relating to any acquisition\nproposal (any such agreement, an \u201calternative acquisition agreement\u201d).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Cowen stockholder approval, if Cowen receives a bona fide\nwritten acquisition proposal not resulting from a material breach of the terms of the merger agreement, Cowen may\nand may permit is subsidiaries and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 representatives to furnish or cause to be furnished\n106\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nconfidential or nonpublic information or data and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with the\nperson making the acquisition proposal, so long as, in each case, prior to taking such actions:\n\u2022\nthe Board, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith\nthat failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e and\n\u2022\nprior to providing any confidential or nonpublic information, Cowen has entered into a confidentiality\nagreement with the person making such acquisition proposal on terms no less favorable to Cowen than the\nconfidentiality agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill) and\nwhich does not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Cowen, and Cowen will\nsubstantially concurrently provide to TD any such information which was not previously provided to TD.\nPromptly, and in any event within 24 hours, Cowen is required to advise TD following receipt of any acquisition\nproposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal and the substance\nthereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or\nacquisition proposal), provide TD with an unredacted copy of any such acquisition proposal and any draft\nagreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with any such inquiry or acquisition proposal, and\nkeep TD apprised of any material developments, discussions and negotiations related thereto on a reasonably\ncurrent basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or acquisition proposal.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Cowen will be permitted to waive any standstill provision to allow any person to\nmake an acquisition proposal if the Board, after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors,\ndetermines in good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under\napplicable law.\nNo Change in Board Recommendation\u037e Alternative Acquisition Agreements and Intervening Events\nIn the merger agreement, Cowen and the Board agreed to unanimously recommend that holders of the common stock\nadopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (the \u201cBoard\nrecommendation\u201d).\nSubject to certain exceptions, Cowen and the Board may not engage in any of the following actions or publicly\npropose to do any of the following (collectively, a \u201crecommendation change\u201d):\n\u2022\nwithhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to TD the Board recommendation\u037e\n\u2022\nfail to include the Board recommendation in this proxy statement\u037e\n\u2022\nadopt, approve, recommend or endorse an acquisition proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt,\napprove, recommend or endorse an acquisition proposal\u037e or\n\u2022\nfail to publicly and without qualification (A) recommend against any acquisition proposal structured as a\ntender offer or exchange offer or (B) reaffirm the Board recommendation, in the case of each of clauses (A)\nand (B), after an acquisition proposal is made public within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of\ndays as remains prior to the special meeting) after written request by TD to do so.\nPrior to the time that the Cowen stockholder approval is obtained, the Board may make a recommendation change if\n(i) (A) the Board has received a bona fide acquisition proposal which did not result from a breach of the non-\nsolicitation obligations under the merger agreement, which it, after consultation with its outside counsel and its\nfinancial advisors, determines in good faith constitutes a superior proposal, in which case, the Board may also cause\nCowen to terminate the merger agreement for the purpose of entering into an alternative acquisition agreement with\nrespect to such superior proposal (subject to paying the required Cowen termination fee to TD with respect to such\ntermination, as described in the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 111 of\nthis proxy statement), or (B) solely in response to an intervening event (as defined in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement-Covenants and Agreements-No Change in Board Recommendation\u037e Alternative Acquisition\nAgreements and Intervening Events\u201d beginning on page 107 of this proxy statement), and (ii) the Board after\nconsultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith that failure to take such\nactions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. However, Cowen and the Board may not\ntake any such actions unless:\n107\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nCowen delivers to TD at least three (3) business days\u2019 prior written notice of its intention to take such\naction, and furnishes to TD a reasonable description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its\ndetermination to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to an acquisition\nproposal, the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal, a copy of the proposed transaction\nagreement(s) and all other documents relating to such acquisition proposal)\u037e\n\u2022\nprior to taking such action, Cowen negotiates, and causes its financial, legal, and other advisors to\nnegotiate, in good faith with TD, during the three-business-day period following Cowen\u2019s delivery of such\nnotice (to the extent TD desires to so negotiate) any revision to the terms of the merger agreement that TD\ndesires to propose\u037e and\n\u2022\nafter the conclusion of such three-business-day period, the Board determines in good faith, after giving\neffect to all of the adjustments or revisions (if any) which may be offered by TD, that such acquisition\nproposal continues to constitute a superior proposal and failure to take such action would continue to be\ninconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.\nNotwithstanding any recommendation change, unless the merger agreement has been terminated, Cowen agreed in\nthe merger agreement that the special meeting will be convened and the merger agreement will be submitted to the\nstockholders of Cowen at the special meeting. In addition, unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance\nwith its terms, Cowen has agreed that it will not submit any acquisition proposal to its stockholders for approval.\nCowen agreed in the merger agreement it will only adjourn or postpone the special meeting if:\n\u2022\non the date of the special meeting, there are insufficient shares of common stock represented (either in\nperson or by proxy) to constitute the quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting\u037e\n\u2022\non the date of the special meeting, Cowen has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of\nshares of common stock necessary for the requisite Cowen vote\u037e or\n\u2022\nrequired by applicable law to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is\nprovided to the holders of common stock a reasonable amount of time prior to such meeting.\nWithout the prior written consent of TD, Cowen may not adjourn or postpone the special meeting for more than\nseven (7) business days in the case of any individual adjournment or postponement or more than twenty (20)\nbusiness days in the aggregate.\nIn this proxy statement, we refer to \u201cacquisition proposal\u201d as, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in:\n\u2022\nany acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent or more of the consolidated assets of\nCowen and its subsidiaries or twenty-five percent or more of the common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nany tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such\nthird party beneficially owning twenty-five percent or more of the common stock\u037e or\n\u2022\na merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,\ndissolution or other similar transaction involving Cowen or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in\nthe aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent or more of the consolidated assets of Cowen and its\nsubsidiaries.\nIn this proxy statement, we refer to \u201csuperior proposal\u201d as a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the Board,\nafter consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors, determines in good faith, after taking into\naccount all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including the amount, form and timing of\npayment of consideration, the financing thereof, any associated break-up or termination fee, including those\nprovided for in the merger agreement, expense reimbursement provisions and all conditions to consummation) and\nthe person making the proposal, is:\n\u2022\nmore favorable from a financial point of view to Cowen\u2019s stockholders than the transactions contemplated\nby the merger agreement (taking into account any proposal by TD to amend the terms of the merger\nagreement pursuant to the section of the merger agreement relating to a recommendation change)\u037e and\n\u2022\nreasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth therein.\n108\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProvided, however, that for purposes of this definition of superior proposal, references to \u201ctwenty-five percent\u201d in\nthe definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be references to \u201cfifty percent.\u201d\nIn this proxy statement, we refer to \u201cintervening event\u201d as any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition,\noccurrence or development that does not relate to an acquisition proposal and is not known by, or reasonably\nforeseeable to, the Board as of August 1, 2022 (or, if known or reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which\nwere not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of August 1, 2022)\u037e provided that a change, in and of\nitself, in the trading price of Cowen\u2019s stock, the fact, in and of itself, that Cowen meets or exceeds any revenue or\nearnings projections or any internal financial projections or any change or prospective change, in and of itself, in the\ncredit rating of Cowen will not be taken into account in determining whether an intervening event has occurred (it\nbeing understood that the underlying causes of such change or fact will be taken into account in determining\nwhether a intervening event has occurred).",

The surviving corporation shall be required to, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the\noffice of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and\naddresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal of their shares of appraisal stock and with whom the\nsurviving corporation has not reached agreements as to the value of such shares (the \u201cChancery List\u201d).

The Delaware Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of appraisal\nstock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their certificates of shares of appraisal stock to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any person fails to\ncomply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before\nthe merger, the shares of the class or series of stock of the corporation were listed on a national securities exchange,\nthe Delware Court will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled\nto appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of\nthe class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total\nnumber of shares exceeds $1 million.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceedings, the\nDelaware Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\npersons entitled to appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Chancery List may participate fully in all\nproceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262.\nWhere proceedings are not dismissed, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of\nthe Delaware Court, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceedings the\nDelaware Court shall determine the fair value of shares of appraisal stock taking into account all relevant factors,\nexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest,\nif any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court, in its discretion,\ndetermines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from\nthe effective time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date\nof payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation\nmay pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after such\npayment only on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares of\nappraisal stock as determined by the Delaware Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid by the\nsurviving corporation as part of the pre-judgment payment to the person.\nWhen the fair value of the shares of appraisal stock is determined, the Delaware Court will direct the payment of such\nvalue, with interest thereon, if any, to the persons entitled to receive the same.\nAlthough the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome\nof the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court and persons should recognize that such an\nappraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration.\nMoreover, the surviving corporation does not anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any person\nexercising appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of\nSection 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the relevant shares of appraisal stock is less than the merger consideration.\nIn determining \u201cfair value\u201d, the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.\nUOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an\nappraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered\nacceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered and that \u201c[f]air price\nobviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme\nCourt has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,\ndividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or could be\nascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section\n262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation\nof the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a\n\u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the\nspeculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme\nCourt construed Section 262 to mean that\n122\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the\ndate of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d In addition, the Delaware courts have\ndecided that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting\nperson\u2019s exclusive remedy.\nThe cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed upon the parties as the\nDelaware Court deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs do not include attorneys\u2019 and expert witness\nfees. Each person is responsible for his, her or its attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, although, upon application of a\nperson whose name appears on the Chancery List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in\nconnection therewith, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of\nappraisal stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to such an\naward pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL. Determinations by the Delaware\nCourt are subject to appellate review by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nAny person who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not be entitled to vote for any\npurpose any shares of appraisal stock subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other\ndistributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to\nthe effective time.\nNo appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the\nDelaware Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just, including\nwithout limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court made under Section 262(j) of the\nDGCL\u037e provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an\nappraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person\u2019s demand for appraisal\nand to accept the terms offered upon the merger within sixty (60) days after the effective time. If no petition for\nappraisal is filed with the Delaware Court within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective time, all rights to\nappraisal will cease and any person that previously demanded appraisal will become entitled only to the merger\nconsideration under the merger agreement.\nTo the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary, on the one hand, and Section 262, on\nthe other hand, Section 262 will govern.\n123\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",
