        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR CPA:18 STOCKHOLDERS REGARDING THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING\nThe following questions and answers for CPA:18 Stockholders briefly address some frequently asked questions about the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the special meeting of the stockholders of CPA:18 - Global. They may not include all\nthe information that is important to you. We urge you to read carefully this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes.\nQ. Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?\nA. You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global have agreed to combine the companies via a merger.\nMore specifically, on February 27, 2022, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that\nas of the effective time of the Merger (the \"Effective Time\"), CPA:18 - Global will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as\nthe surviving entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey. From and after that time, in accordance with the applicable provisions\nof the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \"MGCL\") and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the \"MCCLA\"), among other effects of\nthe consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease, the assets of CPA:18 - Global will transfer to, vest in and\ndevolve on Merger Sub, and Merger Sub will become liable for all of the debts and obligations of CPA:18 - Global.\nThe Merger Agreement governs the terms of the Merger and is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.\nIn order to complete the Merger, among other things, CPA:18 Stockholders must approve the Merger in accordance with the MGCL.\nQ. What will holders of CPA:18 Common Stock receive in connection with the Merger? When will they receive it?\nA. As of the Effective Time, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled\nand, in exchange for cancellation of such share (other than shares held by W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries), the rights attaching to such share will\nbe converted automatically into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration consisting of (i)\n0.0978 (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share (the \"stock consideration\") of W. P. Carey common stock,\n$0.001 par value per share (\"W. P. Carey Common Stock\"), and (ii) $3.00 in cash, which will be reduced by the amount (if any) of dividends paid by\nCPA:18 - Global in excess of its regular quarterly dividends and may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger Agreement to\ndefer the closing of the Merger in order to complete the sale of CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects, pursuant to the\nexercise by the third-party lessee of the portfolio of its option to purchase the properties, by the amount (if any) by which the Total Accrued Daily\nAmount exceeds the Dividend Adjustment Amount (as each term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, without interest (including the\ncash, if any, paid in respect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described herein), the \"cash component,\" and together with the stock\nconsideration, the \u201cPer Share Merger Consideration\u201d). The value of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received in exchange for each share\nof CPA:18 Common Stock will fluctuate with the market value of W. P. Carey Common until the Merger is completed. Based on the trailing 3-day\nvolume weighted average price per share of W. P. Carey common stock of $76.17 on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) as of February 25, 2022,\nthe last trading day before public announcement of the Merger, the implied Per Share Merger Consideration was approximately $10.45.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, W. P. Carey expects to issue approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock to\nthe CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries) in connection with the Merger. Upon such issuance, the W. P. Carey\nStockholders and the\n3\nTable of Contents\nCPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company, respectively.\nTo the extent that a holder of CPA:18 Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W. P. Carey Common Stock,\ncomputed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will instead receive a cash\npayment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45.\nQ. What is the expected ongoing annualized dividend rate for a CPA:18 Stockholder based on an original investment of $10.00 per share of\nCPA:18 Class A Common Stock and an original investment of $9.35 per share of CPA:18 Class C Common Stock?\nA. CPA:18 Stockholders currently receive distributions at an annualized rate equivalent to 2.50% on an original investment of $10.00 per share of\nCPA:18 Class A Common Stock and 2.67% on an original investment of $9.35 per share of CPA:18 Class C Common Stock. Following the Merger,\nCPA:18 Stockholders who hold their shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be entitled to receive future dividends paid by W. P. Carey. Based on\nW. P. Carey's current annualized dividend rate and the Exchange Ratio, each holder of CPA:18 Common Stock is expected to receive dividends at an\nannualized rate equivalent to 4.13% on an original investment of $10.00 per share of CPA:18 Class A Common Stock and 4.42% on an original\ninvestment of $9.35 per share of CPA:18 Class C Common Stock.\nQ. Are there any conditions to completion of the Merger?\nA. Yes. The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including among others:\n\u2022approval of the Merger by the requisite vote of the CPA:18 Stockholders\u037e\n\u2022the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, will have become effective\u037e no stop order will have been issued\nor threatened by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") with regard to the registration statement\u037e and all necessary state securities\nor blue sky authorizations will have been received\u037e\n\u2022no order, injunction or other legal restraint or prohibition, preventing the consummation of the Merger, will be in effect\u037e and\n\u2022all consents, approvals, permits and authorizations required by the Merger Agreement to be obtained from any governmental entity will have been\nmade or obtained.\nIf any of these or the other conditions specified in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may be abandoned by either W. P.\nCarey or CPA:18 - Global. For details about the other conditions to completion of the Merger, see \"The Merger Agreement - Conditions to\nObligations to Complete the Merger and Other Transactions,\" beginning on page 105.\nQ. What fees will CPA:18 - Global's advisors and other affiliates of W. P. Carey receive in connection with the Merger?\nA. Carey Asset Management Corp. (\"CAM\") and W. P. Carey & Co. B.V. (\"W. P. Carey BV\"), each an indirect subsidiary of W. P. Carey, and certain\nof their affiliates provide investment and advisory services to CPA:18 - Global pursuant to written advisory and asset management agreements\n(collectively, the \"CPA:18 Advisory Agreements\"). Additionally, WPC-CPA:18 Holdings, LLC (the \"Special General Partner\"), also an indirect\nsubsidiary of W. P. Carey, holds a special general partner interest in CPA:18 Limited Partnership, which is CPA:18 - Global's operating partnership\n(\"CPA:18 LP\"), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of CPA:18 Limited Partnership dated as of January 1, 2015\n(the \"CPA:18 LP Agreement\").\nIn connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, certain fees and distributions are payable to W.\nP. Carey and its affiliates (the \"Advisor Closing Amounts\"),\n4\nTable of Contents\nincluding (i) distributions of Capital Proceeds upon a Change of Control Event, and related allocations of profits and losses, under the CPA:18 LP\nAgreement (as such terms are defined in the CPA:18 LP Agreement) and (ii) rights to amounts in respect of the termination of the Special General\nPartner Interest, pursuant to the CPA:18 LP Agreement (the \"Special GP Amount\").\nHowever, conditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, W. P. Carey has waived all rights to receive\nany and all Advisor Closing Amounts. In addition, W. P. Carey will receive no disposition fees with respect to the consummation of the Merger.\nW. P. Carey and its affiliates will continue to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements and\nthe CPA:18 LP Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. At December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey had accrued and unpaid fees of approximately $1.1\nmillion pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey earned approximately $12.5\nmillion in asset management fees and $7.3 million in Special General Partner distributions from CPA:18 - Global.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, W. P. Carey may be entitled to receive a\ntermination fee and the Advisor Closing Amounts, subject to a credit of the lesser of the termination fee paid and the Special GP Amount. See \"The\nMerger Agreement\" beginning on page 97 for more details.\nQ. Will W. P. Carey or any of its subsidiaries receive any consideration for the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock that they own?\nA. No. Each share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any subsidiary of W. P. Carey immediately prior to the Effective Time\nwill automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey subsidiary will receive any Per Share\nMerger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. As of April 27, 2022, the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey and its\naffiliates beneficially owned 8,556,733 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate.\nQ. Will CPA:18 - Global continue to pay distributions prior to the Effective Time of the Merger?\nA. Yes. The Merger Agreement permits CPA:18 - Global to continue to pay a regular quarterly distribution and any distribution that is necessary for\nCPA:18 - Global to maintain its REIT qualification and to avoid other adverse tax consequences. CPA:18 - Global currently intends to continue to\npay regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders with respect to quarters completed prior to the Merger. If CPA:18 - Global pays any\ndistributions above its regular quarterly distribution, the cash component of the Per Share Merger Consideration will be reduced by the amount of\nsuch excess distributions.\nQ. Will CPA:18 Stockholders who participated in CPA:18 - Global's distribution reinvestment plan immediately prior to its suspension, and\nwho desire to participate in the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan of W. P. Carey following completion of the Merger,\nautomatically be able to participate in such plan?\nA. No, each CPA:18 Stockholder who desires to take part in W. P. Carey\u2019s dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan (the \u201cW. P. Carey DRIP\u201d)\nfollowing the consummation of the Merger will need to enroll in the W. P. Carey DRIP. Stockholders should call W. P. Carey\u2019s Investor Relations\nDepartment at (212) 492-8920.\nQ. When and where is the CPA:18 Special Meeting?\nA. The special meeting of CPA:18 Stockholders will be held on July 26, 2022, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nDue to the public health impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which is referred to as COVID-19, and to support the health and well-being of CPA:18\nStockholders, business partners, employees and the CPA:18 - Global board of directors, the special meeting will be a completely virtual meeting,\nconducted only as an\n5\nTable of Contents\nonline live interactive audio webcast. Please note there will not be a physical meeting for the special meeting. You will be able to attend the special\nm e e t i n g  o n l i n e ,  v o t e  y o u r  s h a r e s  e l e c t r o n i c a l l y ,  a n d  s u b m i t  q u e s t i o n s  d u r i n g  t h e  s p e c i a l  m e e t i n g  b y  v i s i t i n g\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPA18merger and following the instructions on your proxy card. If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are\nheld by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.\nQ. What will be voted on at the CPA:18 Special Meeting?\nA. As provided in the Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders of CPA:18 - Global, the CPA:18 Stockholders are requested to consider and vote\non two proposals: (i) to approve the Merger and (ii) to approve any adjournments of the special meeting, including, without limitation, a motion to\nadjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the\nspecial meeting to approve the foregoing proposals.\nQ. Who can vote at the CPA:18 Special Meeting?\nA. If you are a stockholder of record of CPA:18 - Global at the close of business on April 27, 2022, the record date for CPA:18 - Global's special\nmeeting, which we refer to as the \"CPA:18 Record Date,\" you may vote the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock that you hold on the record date on\nany matter on which such shares are entitled to be voted at the special meeting.\nQ. Why is my vote important?\nA. If you do not submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting as provided in this proxy statement/prospectus, it may be difficult for us to obtain the\nnecessary quorum to hold the special meeting and to determine whether the Merger should be approved. In addition, if the CPA:18 Stockholders\ndo not vote or abstain, then the effect will be the same as voting against the approval of the Merger.\nIf your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, generally, your broker or financial advisor\nwill not be able to cast a vote on the proposal to approve the Merger unless you provide instructions on how you would like your shares to be\nvoted at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. Therefore, your failure to provide voting instructions to the broker or financial advisor will have the same\neffect as a vote against the Merger.\nQ. What constitutes a quorum for the CPA:18 Special Meeting?\nA. The outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast at least 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting\non any matter, being present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the CPA:18 Special Meeting.\nQ. What vote is required?\nA. The affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date entitled to cast a majority of all\nthe votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting on any matter is required to approve the proposal relating to the Merger. Pursuant to\nCPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not\nvote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor\u037e and (ii) for the purpose of\ndetermining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by\nCPA:18 - Global's directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the Merger and will not be included in\nmaking such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey and any of their\naffiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the requisite approval.\n6\nTable of Contents\nAbstentions and \"broker non-votes\" by CPA:18 Stockholders will have the same effect as votes against the approval of the Merger, since the\nproposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes\nentitled to be cast on the matter.\nExcept as described above, each outstanding share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on each proposal submitted\nto the CPA:18 Stockholders for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote. As of the close of business on the CPA:18 Record Date,\nthere were 149,688,862 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding, 8,632,956 of which were beneficially owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors, W.\nP. Carey and any of their affiliates. With respect to the proposal relating to the Merger, given that the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock beneficially\nowned by any of CPA:18 - Global's directors, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account for the purpose of determining\nwhether the requisite stockholder approval for the Merger has been obtained, the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 141,055,906 shares\nof CPA:18 Common Stock is required to approve the Merger.\nQ. How does the board of directors recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nA. The board of directors of CPA:18 - Global believes that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18\nStockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available\nfrom unaffiliated third parties. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors) recommends that you\nvote \"FOR\" the approval of the Merger.\nQ. When is the Merger expected to be completed?\nA. CPA:18 - Global currently expects to complete the Merger in the third quarter of 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter\u037e however, there can be no\nassurance as to when, or if, the Merger will be completed. W. P. Carey has the right under the Merger Agreement to defer the closing date in order\nto complete the sale of CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects. The third-party lessee of the portfolio has a right to\npurchase the portfolio at pre-determined prices if CPA:18 - Global engages in certain transactions, including the Merger. The third-party lessee has\nexercised its option to purchase the Iberian student housing portfolio.\nCPA:18 - Global reserves the right to abandon the Merger even if the CPA:18 Stockholders vote to approve the Merger and all other conditions to\nthe completion of the Merger are satisfied or waived, if the board of directors determines that the Merger is no longer in the best interests of the\nCPA:18 Stockholders.\nQ. Are there risks associated with the Merger that I should consider in deciding how to vote?\nA. Yes. There are a number of risks related to the Merger that are discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus. In evaluating the Merger, you\nshould read carefully the detailed description of the risks associated with the Merger described in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" and other\ninformation either included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.\nQ. Will holders of CPA:18 Common Stock have to pay federal income taxes as a result of the Merger?\nA. CPA:18 Stockholders should not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange of W. P. Carey Common Stock\nfor shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the Merger, except to the extent of any cash received as consideration in the exchange, as discussed herein.\nQ. Am I entitled to dissenting stockholders' rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA. CPA:18 Stockholders are not entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in\nconnection with the Merger under the CPA:18 Charter and the MGCL.\n7\nTable of Contents\nQ. How do I vote without attending the special meeting?\nA. If you are a holder of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date you may authorize a proxy to vote your shares by completing,\nsigning and promptly returning the proxy card in the self-addressed stamped envelope provided. You may also authorize a proxy to vote your\nshares by telephone or over the Internet as described in your proxy card or voting instruction form. Authorizing a proxy by telephone or over the\nInternet or by mailing a proxy card will not limit your right to attend the special meeting virtually and vote via the special meeting website. Those\nstockholders and stockholders of record who choose to authorize a proxy by telephone or over the Internet must do so no later than 11:59 p.m.,\nEastern Time, on July 25, 2022.\nQ. Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?\nA. For the health and well-being of our stockholders, employees and directors, we have determined that the CPA:18 Special Meeting will be held in\na virtual meeting format only, with no physical in-person meeting. Stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date are invited to\nattend the special meeting virtually and vote at the special meeting via the special meeting website.\nIf your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are not the stockholder of record. Therefore, to vote\nat the CPA:18 Special Meeting, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.\nQ. If my shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, will my broker or financial advisor\nvote my shares of CPA:18 Common Stock for me?\nA. If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, you should follow the directions\nprovided by your broker or financial advisor. It is important to note that your broker or financial advisor may not vote your shares of CPA:18\nCommon Stock if you do not provide instructions on how you would like your shares to be voted at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. Therefore, your\nfailure to provide voting instructions to the broker or financial advisor may have the same effect as a vote against the Merger.\nQ. Once the Merger has been completed, do CPA:18 Stockholders have to do anything to receive their Per Share Merger Consideration?\nA. No. Following the Effective Time of the Merger, W. P. Carey will cause a third-party transfer agent to record the issuance of the shares of W. P.\nCarey Common Stock to the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock on the stock records of W. P. Carey. W. P. Carey will issue shares of W. P. Carey\nCommon Stock to holders of CPA:18 Common Stock in uncertificated book-entry form. No physical stock certificates representing the shares of W.\nP. Carey Common Stock will be delivered. The cash component of the Per Share Merger consideration will be sent in the form of a check to the\ninvestor\u2019s address of record or alternate payment instructions established by the investor on their account for non-custodial accounts. If shares\nare held in a custodial or broker-controlled account, payment will be made to the custodian or broker/dealer, as applicable.\nQ. What do I need to do now?\nA. You should carefully read and consider the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, including its annexes and the information\nincorporated by reference into this document. It contains important information about the factors that the CPA:18 - Global considered in evaluating\nwhether to vote to approve the Merger. You should then complete and sign your proxy card and return it in the enclosed envelope as soon as\npossible so that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, or authorize your proxy by telephone or over the Internet in accordance with\nthe instructions on your proxy card. If your shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held in accounts controlled by a broker or financial advisor, you\nshould receive a separate voting instruction form with this proxy statement/prospectus.\n8\nTable of Contents\nQ. Can I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?\nA. Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your shares are voted at your special meeting. To revoke your proxy, you must either (i) notify\nthe Corporate Secretary of CPA:18 - Global in writing, (ii) mail a new, properly executed proxy card dated after the date of the proxy you wish to\nrevoke, (iii) submit a later dated proxy by telephone or over the Internet by following the instructions on your proxy card or (iv) attend the special\nmeeting virtually and vote via the special meeting website. Merely attending the special meeting will not constitute revocation of your proxy. If\nyour shares of CPA:18 Common Stock are held through a broker, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to\nchange your vote.\nQ. Will a proxy solicitor be used?\nA. Yes. CPA:18 - Global expects to utilize some of the officers and employees of W. P. Carey's wholly-owned subsidiary, CAM, and certain of W.

P. Carey Inc.\nOne Manhattan West\n395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor\nNew York, New York 10001\n(212) 492-1100\nW. P. Carey Inc. (\u201cW. P. Carey\u201d), together with its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors, is an internally-managed\ndiversified real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") and a leading owner of commercial real estate, net-leased to companies located\nprimarily in the United States and Northern and Western Europe on a long-term basis. The vast majority of W. P. Carey's\nrevenues originate from lease revenue provided by its real estate portfolio, which is comprised primarily of single-tenant\nindustrial, warehouse, office, retail, and self-storage facilities that are critical to its tenants\u2019 operations. W. P. Carey's portfolio is\ncomprised of 1,304 properties, net-leased to 352 tenants in 24 countries. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 63% of our\ncontractual minimum annualized base rent (\u201cABR\u201d) was generated by properties located in the United States and approximately\n35% was generated by properties located in Europe. As of that same date, W. P. Carey's portfolio included 20 operating\nproperties, comprised of 19 self-storage properties and one hotel.\nW. P. Carey also earns fees and other income by managing the portfolios of two remaining non-traded investment programs\n(including CPA:18 - Global) through its investment management business. W. P. Carey no longer sponsors new investment\nprograms, and, following the consummation of the Merger, will no longer be an advisor to CPA:18 - Global.\nFounded in 1973, W. P. Carey became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) in 1998 and\nreorganized as a REIT in 2012. Shares of W. P.

As a REIT, CPA:18 - Global is not subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect\nto the portion of its income distributed annually to its stockholders as long as CPA:18 - Global satisfies certain requirements,\nprincipally relating to the nature of its income and the level of its distributions, among other factors.

P. Carey Inc.\nOne Manhattan West\n395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor\nNew York, New York 10001\n(212) 492-1100\nCPA18 Merger Sub LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey (\"Merger\nSub\"), was formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the Merger. Merger Sub has not carried on any activities or operations to\ndate, except for those activities incidental to its formation and undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement. By operation of the merger, CPA:18 - Global will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub\nsurviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey.\nReasons for the Merger\nThe board of directors of W. P. Carey has determined that the Merger satisfies many objectives of W. P. Carey for its growth and\nfuture return to its stockholders. Some of the material factors considered by W. P. Carey's board of directors include:\nStrategic Benefits\n\u2022the Merger is expected to be immediately accretive to the real estate segment of the combined company's Adjusted Funds From\nOperations (\"AFFO\") per share\u037e\n\u2022the Merger improves W. P. Carey's earnings quality by replacing investment management fee streams with stable, higher-value\nreal estate rental income and increases the percentage of W. P. Carey\u2019s dividend covered by real estate rental income\u037e\n1\n1\nTable of Contents\n\u2022the consummation of the Merger will substantially complete W. P. Carey's long-term strategy to exit the investment management\nbusiness, simplifying operations and future reporting disclosures\u037e\n\u2022given that W. P. Carey and its affiliates act as CPA:18 - Global's advisor and manage the day-to-day activities of CPA:18 - Global,\nthe Merger would not require real estate due diligence that would otherwise occur with an unrelated third party and significantly\nreduces integration risks\u037e\n\u2022the high likelihood that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner given the commitment of both parties to complete the\nMerger pursuant to their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, the absence of any significant closing conditions\nunder the Merger Agreement, other than the CPA:18 Stockholder Approval and third-party consents, and the fact that W. P.\nCarey's obligation to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing contingency\u037e\n\u2022the expectation that, upon completion of the Merger, existing W. P. Carey Stockholders will own approximately 93% of the\ncombined company\u037e\n\u2022provisions in the Merger Agreement including the requirement of CPA:18 - Global to pay W. P. Carey a termination fee if the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances\u037e\nPortfolio Benefits\n\u2022CPA:18 - Global owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is aligned with W. P. Carey's existing portfolio based on asset type,\ntenant industry and geographic locations\u037e\n\u2022the Merger will further increase W. P. Carey\u2019s portfolio diversification and improve certain metrics including decreasing its top\nten tenant concentration\u037e\n\u2022W. P. Carey will acquire a portfolio of operating self-storage assets that provide compelling opportunities for potential upside\u037e\n\u2022as a result of the Merger, the remaining joint ventures between W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global on seven properties will be\ncollapsed\u037e\nSize and Scale Benefits\n\u2022the Merger increases W. P. Carey's size and scale resulting in a combined company equity market capitalization of approximately\n$15.8 billion and a combined company total enterprise value of approximately $23.4 billion\u037e\n\u2022the Merger will further solidify W. P. Carey as one of the largest REITs in the U.S. REIT Index (RMZ)\u037e\n\u2022the Merger will improve operational efficiency by spreading W. P. Carey's general and administrative expenses over a larger\nowned real estate asset base\u037e\nBalance Sheet Benefits\n\u2022the combined company is expected to maintain W. P. Carey's strong and flexible investment-grade balance sheet\u037e\n\u2022the Merger is not expected to meaningfully alter balance sheet metrics of W. P. Carey, due to the relative size of CPA:18 - Global\nand its leverage profile\u037e\n\u2022the Merger presents the opportunity for potential interest-cost savings and additional accretion from refinancing opportunities\u037e\nand\n\u2022the Merger is expected to improve W. P. Carey's overall cost of capital and incrementally increase stock liquidity.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe board of directors of W. P. Carey also considered a number of potentially negative factors about pursuing the Merger,\nincluding:\n\u2022the Merger is expected to lower overall AFFO per share due to the reduction in asset management fees and reimbursements paid\nby CPA:18 - Global\u037e\n\u2022the temporary increase in the ratio of secured debt to gross assets and certain leverage metrics as a result of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022the possibility that the Merger may not be completed, or that completion may be unduly delayed, for reasons beyond the\ncontrol of W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global\u037e\n\u2022the risk that failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the financial results of W. P. Carey and the price of its\ncommon stock\u037e\n\u2022the possibility that the value per share for W. P. Carey Stockholders could be reduced immediately following the Merger\u037e\n\u2022the substantial costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Merger\u037e\n\u2022certain CPA:18 - Global assets have higher risk profiles or may not be aligned with W. P. Carey's long-term investment strategy\u037e\n\u2022the obligation of W. P. Carey to pay certain expenses if the Merger is terminated under certain conditions\u037e\n\u2022the risk that the efforts necessary to complete the Merger could result in a disruption in the operations of W. P. Carey by, among\nother things, diverting management focus and other resources of W. P. Carey from operational matters, strategic opportunities\nand its day-to-day business\u037e\n\u2022the risk that certain anticipated benefits of the transaction might not be realized on the expected timeframe or at all\u037e and\n\u2022the other relevant factors to W. P. Carey described under the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nAt a meeting on February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors)\nand the CPA:18 Special Committee adopted resolutions declaring that the Merger is (A) advisable and in the best interests of\nCPA:18 - Global and the stockholders of CPA:18 - Global, (B) fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and (C) on terms and\nconditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties, and directing that the Merger be submitted for\nconsideration at a special meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders. Jason E. Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P.\nCarey, abstained from voting on the matters. In making their determination, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18\nSpecial Committee considered a variety of factors, as described under \"The Merger - CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger\"\nbeginning on page 43. Some of those factors are:\n\u2022the expectation that the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey will provide liquidity to CPA:18 - Global's stockholders by\ndelivering to them cash and shares in a publicly traded company with a broad stockholder base, and with no lock-ups or other\nrestrictions on transfer on the shares\u037e\n\u2022the Per Share Merger Consideration implies a premium of 17% and 15% to CPA:18 - Global's most recently published net asset\nvalue (\"NAV\") per share of $9.07 at September 30, 2021, based on the closing price of W. P. Carey Common Stock of $77.66 on\nFebruary 25, 2022 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger) and the 3-day volume weighted-average price of\n$76.17 for the three days ending on and including February 25, 2022, respectively\u037e\n\u2022the dividend that the CPA:18 Stockholders will receive on the stock consideration, based on W. P. Carey's existing dividend rate\nwill be slightly increased\u037e\n13\nTable of Contents\n\u2022the expectation that the combined company will be among the largest publicly traded REITs with an expected enterprise value of\napproximately $23.4 billion and total market capitalization of approximately $15.8 billion, and a more diversified portfolio of\napproximately 1,338 properties with 164 million square feet of corporate real estate leased to approximately 380 companies around\nthe world\u037e\n\u2022as a result of its larger size and enhanced balance sheet, the combined company is expected to have greater operating and\nfinancial flexibility and better access to capital markets with a lower cost of capital than CPA:18 - Global on a standalone basis\u037e\n\u2022subject to the discussion below regarding the receipt of cash consideration, the receipt of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock\nin the Merger will be tax-deferred to CPA:18 Stockholders, until such time as the shares of W. P. Carey received in the Merger are\nsold\u037e\n\u2022the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee each concluded, after consideration and review with its\nlegal and financial advisors, that the transaction with W. P. Carey was superior to other possible liquidity alternatives for a\nnumber of reasons, as described under \"The Merger - CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger\" beginning on page 43\u037e\n\u2022the Per Share Merger Consideration and the other terms of the Merger Agreement resulted from arm's length negotiations\nbetween the CPA:18 Special Committee and W. P. Carey, with the assistance of their respective advisors\u037e\n\u2022the ability of CPA:18 - Global under the Merger Agreement, during the \"go-shop\" period, to seek acquisition proposals from\nthird parties\u037e and\n\u2022the oral opinion rendered to the CPA:18 Special Committee by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\"Morgan Stanley\"), which was\nsubsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the CPA:18 Special Committee that, as of February 27, 2022,\nand based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley, as set forth in Morgan Stanley's opinion, the Per Share Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from\na financial point of view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the\nExcluded Shares).\nThe CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee also considered a number of potentially negative\nfactors about the Merger, including:\n\u2022the possibility that the transaction with W. P. Carey would not be completed or may be delayed, and the possible adverse effects\non the future liquidity options for CPA:18 - Global that might result if the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey were announced\nand not completed\u037e\n\u2022the risk that a different liquidity alternative or a decision not to enter into a current liquidity transaction could ultimately have\nbeen more beneficial to CPA:18 Stockholders than the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey\u037e\n\u2022the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the solicitation of a competing transaction after the go-shop period and the\nrequirement under the Merger Agreement that CPA:18 - Global pay W. P. Carey a termination fee of either $15.7 million (1.0% of\nthe equity value of the Merger) or $47.0 million (3.0% of the equity value of the Merger) depending on the circumstances (which,\nin each case, would be credited against the Advisor Closing Amounts (as defined in the Merger Agreement)), which may deter\nthird parties from making a competing offer for CPA:18 - Global prior to completion of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022the fact that the Exchange Ratio is fixed and the total consideration received by CPA:18 - Global could be reduced if W. P. Carey's\nstock price declines below the 3-day volume weighted-average price for the three days ended on and including February 25, 2022\nbefore the closing of the Merger\u037e\n\u2022the risk that the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Merger may not be fully realized\u037e\n14\nTable of Contents\n\u2022the other relevant factors to CPA:18 - Global described under the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nFor a discussion of the material factors considered by the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee\nin reaching their conclusion and the reasons why the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee\ndetermined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, please see\n\"The Merger - CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger\" beginning on page 43.\nThe Merger Agreement\nAs of the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the\nEffective Time will be cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share, the rights attaching to such share will be\nconverted automatically into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration\nconsisting of (i) 0.0978 (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share (the \"stock\nconsideration\") of W. P. Carey common stock, $0.001 par value per share (\"W. P. Carey Common Stock\"), and (ii) $3.00 in cash,\nwhich will be reduced by the amount (if any) of dividends paid by CPA:18 - Global in excess of its regular quarterly dividends and\nmay be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger Agreement to defer the closing of the Merger in order to\ncomplete the sale of CPA:18 - Global's portfolio of Iberian student housing projects, pursuant to the exercise by the third-party\nlessee of the portfolio of its option to purchase the properties, by the amount (if any) by which the Total Accrued Daily Amount\nexceeds the Dividend Adjustment Amount (as each term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, without interest\n(including the cash, if any, paid in respect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described herein), the \"cash component,\" and\ntogether with the stock consideration, the \u201cPer Share Merger Consideration\u201d).\nEach share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the\nEffective Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. In addition, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P.\nCarey subsidiary will receive any Per Share Merger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. No\nfractional shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued under the Merger Agreement. To the extent that a holder of CPA:18\nCommon Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W. P. Carey Common Stock, computed on the basis\nof the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will instead receive a cash\npayment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45. CPA:18 Stockholders are not\nentitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the\nMerger or the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nThe respective obligations of the parties to the Merger Agreement to effect the Merger and to consummate the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the Closing Date are subject\nto the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions on or prior to the Closing Date, including:\n\u2022the CPA:18 Stockholder Approval (for the Merger) will have been obtained\u037e\n\u2022the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, will have become effective in accordance with\nthe Securities Act\u037e no stop order will have been issued by the SEC and remain in effect, and no proceeding will have been\ncommenced or threatened, suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement\u037e and all necessary state securities or blue\nsky authorizations will have been received\u037e\n\u2022no temporary restraining order, injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or\nprohibition, preventing the consummation of the Merger, will be in effect\u037e and\n\u2022all consents, approvals, permits and authorizations required by the Merger Agreement to be obtained from any governmental\nentity will have been made or obtained.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe obligations of W.

P. Carey, if (i) prior to the CPA:18 Special Meeting, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors or any committee thereof has\nwithdrawn or modified in any manner adverse to W. P.

P. Carey's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with\nthe Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, all outside attorneys',\naccountants' and investment bankers' fees and expenses), if the Merger Agreement is terminated by W. P. Carey due to a breach\nof any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of CPA:18 - Global set forth in the Merger Agreement, or if\nany representation or warranty of CPA:18 Global has\n17\nTable of Contents\nbecome untrue, in either case such that the related closing condition is incapable of being satisfied by August 31, 2022.\nW. P.

P. Carey or Merger Sub set forth in the\nMerger Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of W. P. Carey or Merger Sub has become untrue, in either case such that\nthe related closing condition is incapable of being satisfied by August 31, 2022.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated either (i) by CPA:18 - Global because the CPA:18 Special Committee withdrew\nits recommendation of the Merger or the Merger Agreement, or approved or recommended a CPA18 Superior Competing\nTransaction, or (ii) by W. P. Carey because (A) prior to the CPA:18 Special Meeting, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors or any\ncommittee thereof withdrew or modified in any manner adverse to W. P. Carey its approval or recommendation of the Merger or\nthe Merger Agreement in connection with, or approved or recommended, any CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction or (B)\nCPA:18 - Global entered into any agreement with respect to any CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction (each of the events\nsummarized in clauses (i) and (ii), as more fully described in the Merger Agreement, an \"Applicable Termination Provision\"),\nthen in each instance, CPA:18 - Global has agreed to pay to W. P. Carey a termination fee equal to $47.0 million, provided that if\nCPA:18 - Global enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with an Exempted Person with respect to a CPA:18 Superior\nCompeting Transaction, the termination fee will be $15.7 million (the \"CPA:18 Termination Fee\").\nIn the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to an Applicable Termination Provision, the CPA:18 Termination\nFee is actually paid, and the Advisor Closing Amounts become payable as a result thereof, then (I) an amount, equal to the lesser\nof the CPA:18 Termination Fee actually paid and the Special GP Amount, will be credited against the Advisor Closing Amounts\npayable to W. P. Carey and its affiliates and (II) no Disposition Fees will be payable to W. P.

P. Carey and its Affiliates at the closing of the CPA:18\nCompeting Transaction pursuant to Section 11.7 of the CPA:18 LP Agreement.\nExcept as set forth above, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global will each pay its respective out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred\nin connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. W. P.\nCarey and CPA:18 - Global will each bear one-half of the costs of filing, printing and mailing the registration statement and this\nproxy statement/prospectus.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a go-shop provision that allowed CPA:18 - Global to initiate, solicit, discuss and negotiate\nalternative acquisition proposals for 30 days following the execution of the Merger Agreement, which period expired on March\n30, 2022 with no proposals or offers for a CPA:18 Competing Transaction having been received. The Merger Agreement contains\n\"no-shop\" provisions that, subject to customary exceptions and the go-shop period, restrict CPA:18 - Global's ability after the\ngo-shop period to initiate, solicit, discuss, negotiate or approve proposals or offers for a CPA:18 Competing Transaction to\nacquire all or a significant part of CPA:18 - Global. Further, there are a limited number of exceptions that would allow the CPA:18\nSpecial Committee to withdraw or change its recommendation for the approval of the Merger. Although the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee is permitted to take these actions if it determines in good faith that a failure to take such actions would be inconsistent\nwith the duties of the CPA:18 Special Committee members under applicable law, doing so in specified situations could entitle W.\nP. Carey to terminate the Merger Agreement and to be paid the CPA:18 Termination Fee.\n18\nTable of Contents\nSee \"The Merger Agreement\" beginning on page 97.\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors of CPA:18 - Global\nAT A MEETING ON FEBRUARY 27, 2022, THE CPA:18 - GLOBAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS (WITH THE UNANIMOUS VOTE\nOF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS), AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF\nTHE CPA:18 SPECIAL COMMITTEE, ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS DECLARING THAT THE MERGER IS ADVISABLE AND IN\nTHE BEST INTERESTS OF CPA:18 - GLOBAL AND THE CPA:18 STOCKHOLDERS, AND THAT THE MERGER IS FAIR AND\nREASONABLE TO CPA:18 - GLOBAL AND ON TERMS AND CONDITIONS AT LEAST AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE\nAVAILABLE FROM UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES, AND DIRECTING THAT THE MERGER BE SUBMITTED FOR\nCONSIDERATION AT THE CPA:18 SPECIAL MEETING. THE CPA:18 - GLOBAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS\nTHAT THE CPA:18 STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER. JASON E. FOX, A DIRECTOR OF EACH\nOF CPA:18 - GLOBAL AND W. P. CAREY, ABSTAINED FROM VOTING ON THE MATTERS.\nVote Required\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 - Global Record Date entitled\nto cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting on any matter is required to approve the\nproposal relating to the Merger. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of\ntheir affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a\ntransaction between CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor\u037e and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage\nin interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's\ndirectors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the Merger and will not be included in\nmaking such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey\nand any of their affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the\nrequisite approval.\nEach outstanding share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on each proposal submitted to the\nCPA:18 Stockholders for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote. As of the close of business on the CPA:18\nRecord Date, there were 149,688,862 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding, 8,632,956 of which were beneficially owned by\nCPA:18 - Global's directors and affiliates, including W. P. Carey. With respect to the proposal relating to the Merger, given that the\nshares of CPA:18 Common Stock beneficially owned by any of CPA:18 - Global's directors, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates\nwill not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the requisite stockholder approval for the Merger has been\nobtained, the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 141,055,906 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock is required to approve\nthe Merger. Abstentions and \"broker non-votes\" will have the same effect as votes against approval of the Merger since such\nproposal requires the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by CPA:18\nStockholders on the matter.\nSee \"The CPA:18 - Special Meeting\" beginning on page 92.\nDate, Time, Place and Purpose of CPA:18 Special Meeting\nThe CPA:18 Special Meeting will be held in virtual format at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPA18merger on July 26, 2022,\n5:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The purposes of the CPA:18 Special Meeting are (i) to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the\nMerger (the \"Merger proposal\")\u037e and (ii) to consider and vote upon any adjournments of the CPA:18 Special Meeting, including,\nwithout limitation, a motion to adjourn the special meeting to another time for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to\napprove the Merger proposal (the \"Adjournment proposal\").\nSee \"The CPA:18 - Special Meeting\" beginning on page 92.\n19\nTable of Contents\nCPA:18 Stockholders Entitled to Vote\nCPA:18 - Global's board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 27, 2022 as the record date for the CPA:18 Special\nMeeting. Accordingly, only holders of record of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date are entitled to\nnotice of, and to vote at, the CPA:18 Special Meeting. As of the CPA:18 Record Date, there were 149,688,862 outstanding shares\nof CPA:18 Common Stock held by approximately 26,930 holders of record. At the CPA:18 Special Meeting, each outstanding\nshare of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on each proposal submitted to the CPA:18 Stockholders\nfor consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote (except that, as described below under \"The CPA:18 Special\nMeeting - Vote Required,\" the CPA:18 - Global directors, W. P. Carey and their affiliates are not entitled to vote on the Merger).\nSee \"The CPA:18 - Special Meeting\" beginning on page 92.\nOpinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee of CPA:18 - Global\nThe CPA:18 Special Committee retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in\nconnection with the Merger. The CPA:18 Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on\nMorgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation, and its knowledge of the business and affairs of CPA:18 - Global. As\npart of this engagement, the CPA:18 Special Committee requested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial\npoint of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the holders of shares of CPA:18\nCommon Stock, other than shares held by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary (referred to as the \"Excluded Shares\"). On\nFebruary 27, 2022, at a meeting of the CPA:18 Special Committee, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, which was\nsubsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the CPA:18 Special Committee dated February 27, 2022,\nthat, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the Per Share Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from\na financial point of view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the\nExcluded Shares).\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley dated February 27, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus\nas Annex B, and is hereby incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety. The opinion sets\nforth, among other things, the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and\nlimitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion.\nSee \"Opinion of Financial Advisor to the Special Committee of CPA:18 - Global\" beginning on page 47.\nBoard of Directors and Management of W. P. Carey\nThe directors and officers of W. P. Carey immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will continue to be the directors and\nofficers of W. P. Carey after the Merger. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the directors of W. P. Carey as a\ngroup received cash and equity compensation of $2.5 million.\nRegulatory Approvals\nNeither W. P. Carey nor CPA:18 - Global is aware of any U.S. federal or state regulatory approvals that must be obtained in\nconnection with the Merger, other than compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, filing articles of merger as\nrequired under Maryland law, and obtaining various state governmental authorizations.\nComparison of Rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and W. P. Carey Stockholders\nBoth CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey are incorporated in Maryland. Upon the effective time of the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders\nwill become stockholders of W. P. Carey. The rights of CPA:18 Stockholders are governed currently by the MGCL, the CPA:18\nCharter and the CPA:18 Bylaws. Once CPA:18 Stockholders become stockholders of W. P. Carey, their rights will continue to be\ngoverned by the MGCL but will be governed by the W. P. Carey Charter and the W. P. Carey Bylaws.\n20\nTable of Contents\nFor the material differences between the rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and the rights of W. P. Carey Stockholders, see\n\"Description of W. P. Carey Shares\" and \"Comparison of Rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and W. P. Carey Stockholders.\"\nMaterial Federal Income Tax Consequences\nAs a condition to and prior to the consummation of the Merger, (i) CPA:18 - Global will have received an opinion of DLA Piper\nLLP (US) to the effect that, at all times since its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, W. P. Carey has been and will continue to\nbe organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, (ii)\nCPA:18 - Global will have received an opinion from Clifford Chance US LLP to the effect that for federal income tax purposes the\nMerger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, (iii) W. P. Carey and Merger Sub will have received an\nopinion from DLA Piper LLP (US) to the effect that for federal income tax purposes the Merger will qualify as a reorganization\nunder Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and (iv) W. P. Carey and Merger Sub will have received an opinion of Clifford Chance US\nLLP to the effect that, at all times since its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, through the closing date of the Merger, CPA:18\n- Global has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the\nCode.\nClifford Chance US LLP, counsel to CPA:18 - Global, and DLA Piper LLP (US), counsel to W. P. Carey, are of the opinion that the\nMerger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. In accordance with this treatment, no\ngain or loss will be recognized by W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global or their stockholders as a result of the Merger except to the extent\nof cash received.\nThe federal income tax treatment of the Merger to holders of CPA:18 Common Stock depends in some instances on\ndeterminations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or\nauthority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences of the Merger to any particular stockholder will depend on your\nparticular tax circumstances. We urge you to consult your tax advisor, particularly if you are a non-U.S. holder, regarding the\nspecific tax consequences, including the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences, to you in light of your particular\ninvestment or tax circumstances of the Merger.\nThe opinions of CPA:18 - Global's tax counsel and W. P. Carey's tax counsel are based upon the law as it will exist as of the date\nof the opinion, but the law may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect. Given the highly complex nature of the rules\ngoverning REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances,\nno assurance can be given by DLA Piper LLP (US) or us that W. P. Carey will qualify as a REIT for any particular year. The\nopinions of Clifford Chance US LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) will be expressed as of the date issued. Clifford Chance US LLP and\nDLA Piper LLP (US) will have no obligation to advise CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey or their stockholders of any subsequent\nchange in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. Also, the opinions of\ntax counsel are not binding on either the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") or a court, and either could take a position\ndifferent from that expressed by tax counsel.\nSee \"Material Federal Income Tax Considerations\" beginning on page 147.\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\nIn considering the recommendation of the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global to approve the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders\nshould be aware that potential conflicts of interest exist because W. P. Carey and its affiliates serve as the advisor for CPA:18 -\nGlobal, the companies share common management, and the officers and directors of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may have\ncertain interests in the proposed transactions that are different from or in addition to the interests of CPA:18 Stockholders\ngenerally. The board of directors of CPA:18 - Global (including the CPA:18 Special Committee) knew about and considered these\npotential conflicts and additional interests when they approved the Merger. Certain of these potential conflicts and interests are\nset forth below.\nConditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, W. P. Carey has waived all rights to\nreceive any and all Advisor Closing Amounts. In addition, W. P. Carey will receive no disposition fees in respect of the\nconsummation of the Merger.\n21\nTable of Contents\nW. P. Carey and its affiliates will continue to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory\nAgreements and the CPA:18 LP Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. At December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey had accrued and\nunpaid fees of approximately $1.1 million pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements. During the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2021, W. P. Carey earned approximately $12.5 million in asset management fees and $7.3 million in Special General\nPartner distributions from CPA:18 - Global.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, W. P. Carey may be entitled\nto receive a termination fee and the Advisor Closing Amounts, subject to a credit of the lesser of the termination fee paid and the\nSpecial GP Amount.\nSee \"Potential Conflicts Of Interest\" beginning on page 56, \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions\" beginning on page\n120 and the section titled \"The Merger Agreement\" beginning on page 97.\nShares Owned by Directors, the Advisor and Their Affiliates\nAs of the close of business on the CPA:18 Record Date, there were 149,688,862 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding,\n8,632,956 of which were beneficially owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors and affiliates, including W. P. Carey. With respect to the\nproposal relating to the Merger, given that the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock beneficially owned by any of CPA:18 - Global's\ndirectors, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the\nrequisite stockholder approval for the Merger has been obtained, the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 141,055,906\nshares of CPA:18 Common Stock is required to approve the Merger.\nDissenters' Appraisal Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders\nUnder the CPA:18 Charter and Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the MGCL, CPA:18 Stockholders are not entitled to dissenting stockholders'\nappraisal rights, rights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the Merger or the Merger Agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby.\nSee \"The Merger Agreement - No Dissenters\u2019 Appraisal Rights or Rights of Objecting Stockholders\" beginning on page 110.\n22",

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the\nfollowing risk factors in determining whether or not to vote for the Merger. You should not consider the list below to be exclusive. New risk\nfactors emerge periodically and stockholders cannot be completely assured that the factors described below list all material risks at any specific\nperiod in time. This section includes or refers to certain forward-looking statements. See the section entitled \"Cautionary Statement Concerning\nForward-Looking Statements\" for the qualifications and limitations of these forward-looking statements. In addition, you should read and\nconsider the risks associated with each of the businesses of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global because these risks also affect the combined\ncompany. Risks in relation to W. P. Carey can be found in Item 1A. Risk Factors in W. P. Carey's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in W. P. Carey\u2019s subsequently\nfiled Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K (excluding any information and exhibits furnished under Item 2.02 or\n7.01 thereof), each of which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Risk Factors in CPA:18 - Global's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on\nFebruary 25, 2022, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in CPA:18 - Global\u2019s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the other\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See \"Where You Can Find More Information\" beginning on page 171.\nW. P. Carey Stockholders will not vote on the Merger.\nRisks Related to the Stock Issuance and Merger\nChanges in the market price of W. P. Carey Common Stock will affect the nominal value of the Per Share Merger Consideration.\nWhile the Exchange Ratio is fixed at 0.0978 of a share of W. P. Carey Common Stock for each share of CPA:18 Common Stock, the nominal value of\nthe stock consideration component of the Per Share Merger Consideration is based on the market price of W. P. Carey Common Stock, which will\nfluctuate as a result of a variety of factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the following factors:\n\u2022market reaction to the Merger and the prospects of the combined company or any of the other matters described herein\u037e\n\u2022changes in market assessments of the business, operations, financial position and prospects of either company\u037e\n\u2022market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed\u037e\n\u2022interest rates, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock\u037e\n\u2022federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses in which W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global\noperate\u037e\n\u2022general market trading activities\u037e and\n\u2022other factors beyond the control of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global, including those described or referred to elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\"\nsection.\nIn addition, sales of W. P. Carey Common Stock received in the Merger generally may be sold in the public markets immediately following the\nMerger since CPA:18 Stockholders may sell their shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock shortly after the Merger for any number of reasons. The sale\nof significant amounts of W. P. Carey Common Stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may lower the market price of W. P. Carey\nCommon Stock.\n25\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock at the Effective Time may vary from its price on the date the Merger Agreement was\nexecuted, on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of the CPA:18 Special Meeting. As a result, the market value of the Per\nShare Merger Consideration will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock during the\nperiod from February 25, 2022, the last trading day before the announcement of the Merger, through April 21, 2022, the market value of the stock\nconsideration comprising part of the Per Share Merger Consideration implies a Per Share Merger Consideration value ranging from a low of $10.57\nto a high of $11.38, representing a 17% to 26% premium to CPA:18 - Global's most recently published estimated net asset value (\"NAV\") per share of\n$9.07 for both CPA:18 Class A Common Stock and CPA:18 Class C Common Stock as of September 30, 2021.\nThe CPA:18 Stockholders may have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the Merger than they\ncurrently exercise over the management and policies of CPA:18 - Global prior to the Merger.\nCurrently the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the CPA:18 Stockholders own all of the outstanding shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock and CPA:18\nCommon Stock, respectively, and thus control all of the voting securities of their respective company. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the\nseparate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease, and each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective\nTime will be cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such shares (other than shares held by W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries), be converted\nautomatically into the right to receive shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock and cash. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, W. P. Carey\nexpects to issue approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock to the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and its\nsubsidiaries) in connection with the Merger. Upon such issuance, the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the CPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey\nand its subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company, respectively. Consequently, the CPA:18 Stockholders, as a\ngeneral matter, may have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the consummation of the Merger than\nthey currently exercise over the management and policies of CPA:18 - Global immediately prior to the Merger.\nThe pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the business and operations of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global.\nWhile we are undertaking the transaction described in the Merger Agreement, tenants of each of W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global may delay or defer\ncertain business decisions, such as whether or not to renew a lease, which could negatively impact the revenues, earnings, cash flows and\nexpenses of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed. In addition, due to operating covenants in the\nMerger Agreement, each of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may be restricted in its ability to pursue certain strategic transactions, undertake\ncertain significant capital or financing transactions and otherwise pursue actions outside of the ordinary course of business, even if such actions\nwould prove beneficial.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global.\nIt is possible that the Merger may not be completed. The parties' respective obligations to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or\nwaiver of specified conditions, some of which are beyond the control of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global. If the Merger is not completed, W. P.\nCarey and CPA:18 - Global may be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:\n\u2022CPA:18 Stockholders would not have had the opportunity to achieve the liquidity event provided by the Merger and the board of directors of\nCPA:18 - Global would have to review other alternatives for liquidity, which may not occur in the near future or on terms as favorable as the Merger\u037e\n\u2022W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global will have incurred substantial costs and expenses related to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial\nadvisor fees, which will be payable by W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global even if the Merger is not completed, and are only subject to reimbursement\nunder certain limited circumstances\u037e\n26\nTable of Contents\n\u2022CPA:18 - Global may be required to pay a termination fee to W. P. Carey in the amount of either $47.0 million or $15.7 million if the Merger\nAgreement is terminated under certain circumstances\u037e and\n\u2022W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may be required to pay the other party's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger if the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts CPA:18 - Global's ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a go-shop provision that allowed CPA:18 - Global to solicit, initiate and pursue alternative acquisition proposals\nfor 30 days following the execution of the Merger Agreement, which period expired on March 30, 2022 with no proposals or offers for a CPA:18\nCompeting Transaction having been received. The Merger Agreement also contains no-shop provisions that, subject to customary exceptions and\nthe go-shop period, restrict CPA:18 - Global's ability to initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate, discuss, negotiate or accept a competing third-party\nproposal to acquire all or a significant part of CPA:18 - Global. Further, there are a limited number of exceptions that would allow the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee to withdraw or change its recommendation relating to the approval of the Merger. Although the CPA:18 Special Committee is permitted\nto take these actions if it determines in good faith that a failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee under applicable law, doing so in specified situations could entitle W. P. Carey to terminate the Merger Agreement and to be paid a\ntermination fee in the amount of either $47.0 million or $15.7 million (depending upon the circumstances surrounding the termination).\nAlthough the go-shop provision was intended to provide CPA:18 - Global the ability to conduct a reasonable \"market check\" on the adequacy of\nthe Per Share Merger Consideration payable to CPA:18 Stockholders in connection with the Merger Agreement, it is possible that the go-shop\nprovision or the other provisions of the Merger Agreement could discourage a potential acquiror that might have had an interest in acquiring all or\na significant part of CPA:18 - Global from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per\nshare cash or market value than the consideration W. P. Carey proposes to pay in the Merger or might result in a potential competing acquiror\nproposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire CPA:18 - Global than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the Advisor Closing\nAmounts (as defined in the Merger Agreement) payable to W. P. Carey and its affiliates and the CPA:18 Termination Fee that may become payable\nto W. P. Carey in certain circumstances, subject to the credit described herein.\nClosing the Merger is subject to a number of conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, could adversely impact W. P. Carey's and CPA:18 -\nGlobal's ability to complete the Merger.\nThe Merger, which currently is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022, is subject to certain closing conditions, including among others: (a)\nthe effectiveness of the registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, pursuant to which shares of W. P. Carey\nCommon Stock will be issued\u037e (b) the accuracy of W. P. Carey's, Merger Sub's and CPA:18 - Global's (as applicable) representations and warranties\nand performance of covenants and obligations, as more fully described in the Merger Agreement\u037e (c) delivery of REIT qualification and other\nopinions\u037e (d) the nonoccurrence of changes, events or circumstances which constitute a CPA:18 Material Adverse Effect or a W. P. Carey Material\nAdverse Effect (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) (as applicable)\u037e and (e) receipt of the CPA:18 Stockholder Approval (for the\nMerger). There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if permitted, or that the occurrence of any effect, event,\ndevelopment or change will not transpire. Therefore, there can be no assurance with respect to the timing of the closing of the Merger or whether\nthe Merger will be completed at all.\nIf the Merger does not occur, CPA:18 - Global may incur payment obligations to W. P. Carey.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under the circumstances described in the section titled \"The Merger Agreement-Termination Expenses\"\nbeginning on page 108, CPA:18 - Global may be obligated to pay W. P. Carey a termination fee in the amount of either $47.0 million or $15.7 million\n(depending upon the circumstances surrounding the termination).\n27\nTable of Contents\nRisk Factors Relating to W. P. Carey Following the Merger\nW. P. Carey's total level of debt will increase upon completion of the Merger.\nIn connection with the Merger, W. P. Carey will assume approximately $1.1 billion of CPA:18 - Global indebtedness, as a result of which, W. P. Carey\nmay be subject to increased risk that the combined company's cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on its debt. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, W. P. Carey's total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $6.8 billion, with a ratio of consolidated debt to gross assets\n(consolidated total assets before accumulated depreciation on buildings and improvements) of approximately 40.1%. Taking into account W. P.\nCarey's existing indebtedness and the assumption of indebtedness after giving effect to the Merger, the indebtedness of the combined company as\nof December 31, 2021 (excluding net lease student housing properties under purchase option, three additional net lease assets, and one operating\nstudent housing property in CPA:18 - Global\u2019s portfolio scheduled for disposition) would be approximately $7.74 billion, with a ratio of consolidated\ndebt to gross assets of approximately 42%.\nThe future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations\nfollowing the Merger.\nFollowing the Merger, the combined company may continue to expand its operations through additional acquisitions and other strategic\ntransactions, some of which may involve complex challenges. The future success of the combined company will depend, in part, upon its ability to\nmanage its expansion opportunities, integrate new operations into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, successfully monitor its\noperations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality, and maintain other necessary internal controls. There can be no assurance that the\ncombined company's expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful, or that the combined company will realize its expected operating\nefficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits.\nThe stock price of W. P. Carey Common Stock following the Merger could be lower.\nW. P. Carey's current or historical share price may not be indicative of how the market will value shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock following the\nMerger . The price of W. P. Carey Common Stock after the Merger could be lower than the current or historical price. One of the factors that may\ninfluence the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock after the Merger will be the yield from distributions on W. P. Carey Common Stock compared to\nyields on other financial instruments. If, for example, an increase in market interest rates results in higher yields on other financial instruments, the\nmarket price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common stock\ndifferently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we currently expect to do so after the consummation of the\ndifferently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs as extensively as we currently expect to do so after the consummation of the\nMerger. The market price of W. P. Carey Common Stock will also be affected by general market conditions and will be potentially affected by the\neconomic and market perception of REIT securities.\nHolders of CPA:18 Common Stock may be adversely affected if the Merger fails to qualify as a tax-deferred transaction.\nSubject to the discussion below regarding the receipt of cash consideration, it is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-deferred reorganization\nunder Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. There is no guarantee, however, that the IRS will agree with this treatment. You are advised to review the\n\"Material Federal Income Tax Considerations\" section beginning on page 147 for additional details.\nAfter the Merger is completed, CPA:18 Stockholders will have different rights that may be less favorable than their current rights as CPA:18\nStockholders.\nAfter the consummation of the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders will have different rights than they currently have as CPA:18 Stockholders. For a\ndetailed discussion of the significant differences between your rights as a stockholder of CPA:18 - Global and your rights as a stockholder of W. P.\nCarey, see \"Comparison of Rights of CPA:18 Stockholders and W. P. Carey Stockholders\" beginning on page 136.\n28\nTable of Contents\nW. P. Carey cannot assure you that it will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate.\nW. P. Carey expects to continue its current dividend practices following the Merger. However, W. P. Carey Stockholders may not receive the same\ndividends following the Merger for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022as a result of the Merger and the issuance of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock in connection with the Merger, the total amount of cash required\nfor W. P. Carey to pay dividends at its current rate will increase\u037e\n\u2022W. P. Carey may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in W. P. Carey's cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash\nflow or financial position\u037e\n\u2022decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the W. P.\nCarey board of directors, which reserves the right to change W. P. Carey's dividend practices at any time and for any reason\u037e and\n\u2022the amount of dividends that W. P. Carey subsidiaries may distribute to W. P. Carey may be subject to restrictions imposed by the terms of any\ncurrent or future indebtedness that such subsidiaries may incur.\nThe combined company will not be required to meet any diversification standards\u037e therefore, our investments may become subject to\nconcentration of risk.\nSubject to the intention to maintain its qualification as a REIT, there are no limitations on the number or value of particular types of investments that\nthe combined company may make. The combined company will not be required to meet any diversification standards, including geographic\ndiversification standards. Therefore, its investments may become concentrated in type or geographic location, which could subject it to significant\nconcentration of risk with potentially adverse effects on its investment objectives.\nBecause W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global have invested in properties located outside the U.S., the combined company will be exposed to\nadditional risks of doing business outside of the U.S. than either on a standalone basis.\nEach of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global has invested in, and following the consummation of the Merger the combined company may continue to\ninvest in, properties located outside the U.S. At December 31, 2021, directly owned real estate properties located outside of the U.S. on a combined\ncompany basis would have represented 37% of the combined company's current annualized contractual minimum base rent, as compared to 37% for\nW. P. Carey's portfolio on a stand-alone basis, and 44% for CPA:18 - Global's portfolio on a stand-alone basis. These investments may be affected\nby factors particular to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. These investments may expose the combined company to risks\nthat are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the U.S., including:\n\u2022changing governmental rules and policies\u037e\n\u2022local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our used standards and practices\u037e\n\u2022enactment of laws relating to the foreign ownership of property and laws relating to the ability of foreign entities to remove invested capital or\nprofits earned from activities within the country to the U.S.\u037e\n\u2022expropriation of investments\u037e\n\u2022legal systems under which the combined company's ability to enforce contractual rights and remedies may be more limited than would be the case\nunder U.S. law\u037e\n\u2022difficulty in conforming obligations in other countries and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, which may be more\nstringent than U.S. laws, including tax requirements and land use, zoning, and environmental laws, as well as changes in such laws\u037e\n\u2022adverse market conditions caused by changes in national or local economic or political conditions\u037e\n29\nTable of Contents\n\u2022acts of violence, pandemics, active shooters, terrorism, political or military instability, insurrection or war\u037e\n\u2022tax requirements vary by country and the combined company may be subject to additional taxes as a result of its international investments\u037e\n\u2022changes in relative interest rates\u037e\n\u2022the cost of and access to various forms of capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations\u037e\n\u2022changes in real estate and other tax rates and other operating expenses in particular countries\u037e\n\u2022changes in land use and zoning laws\u037e\n\u2022restrictions and/or significant costs in repatriating cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts\u037e and\n\u2022the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including instability in, or further withdrawals from, the\nEuropean Union or other international trade alliances or agreements.\nIn addition, the lack of publicly available information in certain jurisdictions in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(\"GAAP\") could impair the combined company's ability to analyze transactions and may cause the combined company to forego an investment\nopportunity. It may also impair the combined company's ability to receive timely and accurate financial information from tenants necessary to meet\nits reporting obligations to financial institutions or governmental or regulatory agencies. Certain of these risks may be greater in emerging markets\nand less developed countries. W. P. Carey's expertise to date is primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and it has less experience in other international\nmarkets. The combined company may not be as familiar with the potential risks to its investments outside the U.S. and Europe and it could incur\nlosses as a result.\nAlso, the combined company may engage third-party asset managers in international jurisdictions to monitor compliance with legal requirements\nand lending agreements with respect to properties it owns. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may expose the combined company or its\noperating subsidiaries to additional liabilities.\nMoreover, the combined company will be subject to changes in foreign exchange rates due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between\nforeign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of a foreign currency of one or more countries where the combined\ncompany has a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on the business, investment returns and, specifically, the combined\ncompany's U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations and debt covenant ratios. Although the combined company will attempt\nto mitigate a portion of the risk from currency fluctuations by entering into derivative hedging agreements and financing its properties with debt in\nlocal currency denominations, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful.\nIf the combined company recognizes impairment charges on its properties or investments following the consummation of the Merger, its net\nincome may be reduced.\nUntil the consummation of the Merger, both companies may incur substantial impairment charges, which each of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global\nare required to recognize whenever they sell a property for less than its carrying value or they determine that the carrying amount of the property is\nnot recoverable and exceeds its fair value\u037e for direct financing leases, whenever the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying property has\ndeclined or, for equity investments, the estimated fair value of the investment's underlying net assets in comparison with the carrying value of their\ninterest in the investment has declined on an other-than-temporary basis. By their nature, the timing or extent of impairment charges are not\npredictable. The combined company may incur non-cash impairment charges in the future, which may reduce its net income.\n30\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill resulting from the consummation of the Merger may adversely affect the combined company's results of operations.\nPotential impairment of goodwill resulting from the Merger could adversely affect the combined company's financial condition and results of\noperations. The combined company will assess its goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually and more\nfrequently when required by GAAP. The combined company will be required to record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset\ncarrying values exceed their fair values the combined company's assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets could\nindicate that an impairment of the carrying value of such assets may have occurred that could result in a material, non-cash write-down of such\nassets, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and future earnings.\nW. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global currently face, and after the consummation of the Merger the combined company will face, other risks.\nThe risks listed above are not exhaustive, and you should be aware that, following the Merger, the combined company will face various other risks,\nincluding those discussed in reports filed by W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global with the SEC. See \"Where You Can Find More Information\" beginning\non page 171.\nRisk Related to CPA:18 - Global\nIf CPA:18 - Global's request for an extension of time under Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-3 to timely make certain entity\nclassification elections with respect to seven of CPA:18 - Global's subsidiaries is not granted, CPA:18 - Global would either fail to qualify as a\nREIT or, assuming certain relief provisions applied, would be required to pay a significant penalty tax. In addition, the closing of the Merger\ncould be delayed.\nBy default, certain non-U.S. entities are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but can elect to be treated as partnerships or\nentities disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which we refer to as flow-through entities. CPA:18 - Global intended to\nelect to treat seven non-U.S. subsidiaries that hold certain properties located outside the United States as flow-through entities for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes at the time that the entities were acquired but inadvertently failed to make such elections. CPA:18 - Global has requested an\nextension of time from the IRS, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-3, to timely elect to treat these entities as flow-through entities\neffective shortly after the acquisition of the entities by CPA:18 - Global. CPA:18 - Global believes that it meets the requirements to be granted such\nextensions and that therefore CPA:18 - Global will be able to treat these subsidiaries as flow-through entities in prior years. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, the IRS may disagree with CPA:18 - Global's position and decide not to grant the extension. As a result, no assurance can be given that\nCPA:18 - Global will in fact be able to make such elections. In addition, there can be no assurance as to when the IRS may decide to grant the\nextension, and while W. P. Carey has agreed with CPA:18 - Global that the decision of the IRS (and the timing of that decision) will not be a basis for\ntermination of the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Merger may be delayed until the extension is received.\nIf the IRS does not grant the extension of time to file these elections, then these subsidiaries would be treated as non-U.S. corporations during\ncertain prior periods. Because interests in non-U.S. corporations are not qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests, CPA:18 - Global's\nownership of such subsidiaries would cause CPA:18 - Global to fail to satisfy certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs during such prior\nperiods. In that event, CPA:18 - Global would either fail to qualify as a REIT beginning with such prior periods, in which case CPA:18 - Global would\nbe liable for substantial corporate income taxes for such prior periods, or if CPA:18 - Global were able to establish that it acted with reasonable\ncause and not willful neglect, CPA:18 - Global could maintain its REIT qualification but would be required to pay a penalty tax with respect to such\nfailures, which could be material in amount. Prior to the Merger, any such taxes would be liabilities of CPA:18 - Global. Moreover, to the extent that\nCPA:18 - Global is liable for such penalty taxes, or if CPA:18 - Global fails to qualify as a REIT, following the Merger, the liability for any such\npenalty taxes or any corporate income taxes owed by CPA:18 - Global as a result of its failure to qualify as a REIT would generally become liabilities\nof W.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nW. P. Carey Inc. is an internally-managed diversified real estate investment trust and a leading owner of commercial real estate, net-leased to\ncompanies located primarily in the United States and Northern and Western Europe on a long-term basis. W. P. Carey's management and board of\ndirectors regularly evaluate and consider a variety of opportunities as part of W. P. Carey\u2019s long-term strategy to maximize stockholder value. In\nparticular, W. P. Carey's board of directors considers opportunities that will, among other things, (i) enhance W. P. Carey's overall credit quality, (ii)\nfurther diversify and improve the quality of its existing portfolio, (iii) allow W. P. Carey to better support its recurring dividend and (iv) further\nsimplify its business.\nThe W. P. Carey board of directors and W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management regularly review and assess W. P. Carey\u2019s business, operations and\nfinancial performance, industry conditions and related developments as they may impact W. P. Carey\u2019s long-term strategic plans and objectives. As\npart of this ongoing evaluation, the W. P. Carey board of directors, together with W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management, has from time to time considered\nvarious potential financial and strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value, including the evaluation of merger and acquisition\ntransactions of various types and the potential benefits and risks of any such transactions. In addition, W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management, from time\nto time, has engaged in discussions with representatives of\n33Table of Contents\nother companies regarding such opportunities and updated the W. P. Carey board of directors regarding the content of such discussions.\nCPA:18 - Global is a publicly registered non-traded REIT formed in 2012. CPA:18 - Global invests in a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate\nproperties both in and outside the United States that includes net lease, student housing and self-storage properties with an aggregate book value\nof approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, CPA:18 - Global's portfolio consisted of interests in 53 net lease\nproperties, 65 self-storage properties, three student housing development projects, and one student housing operating property.\nCPA:18 - Global was formed to hold its investments for a number of years. As stated in CPA:18 - Global's initial public offering documents, CPA:18 -\nGlobal's intention was to begin considering liquidity events for its stockholders generally commencing seven to twelve years following the closing\nof its initial public offering, which occurred in 2015.\nIn June 2021, members of W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management approached members of the CPA:18 - Global board of directors to informally discuss\ntiming considerations of potential liquidity events for CPA:18 - Global and CPA:18 - Global\u2019s openness to engaging in a potential transaction with\nW. P. Carey. Two in-person meetings were held on June 30, 2021, the first between Jason E. Fox, W. P. Carey\u2019s chief executive officer, and Richard\nPinola, one of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s independent directors, and the second, between John Park, W. P. Carey\u2019s president, and Elizabeth P. Munson, the\nchairman of the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global, in Connecticut and New York, respectively. Neither Mr. Fox nor Mr. Park made any specific\nproposals during their respective meetings with Mr. Pinola and Ms. Munson. Messrs. Fox and Park kept the W. P. Carey board of directors updated\nabout their discussions with the CPA:18 - Global directors.\nOn July 12, 2021, members of W. P Carey\u2019s senior management met by videoconference with representatives from BofA Securities, Inc. (\u201cBofA\nSecurities\u201d), which had previously acted as a financial advisor to W. P. Carey. The purpose of the meeting was to evaluate a potential transaction\ninvolving CPA:18 - Global.\nLater the same day, the same members of W. P Carey\u2019s senior management team met by videoconference with representatives from Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC. Likewise, the purpose of this meeting involved the evaluation of a potential transaction with CPA:18 - Global.\nOn August 27, 2021, representatives of W. P. Carey made a presentation to the independent directors of CPA:18 - Global (the \"CPA:18 Independent\nDirectors\") that included an offer from W. P. Carey to acquire CPA:18 - Global in a merger transaction in which CPA:18 - Global stockholders would\nreceive a combination of cash and W. P. Carey Common Stock with a total value of $9.40 per CPA:18 - Global share (the \"August W. P. Carey\nProposal\"). The presentation did not specify the proposed allocation of the merger consideration between stock and cash, nor did it specify how\nthe share exchange ratio would be determined. The presentation stated that the August W. P. Carey Proposal would expire on September 30, 2021.\nThe CPA:18 Independent Directors had not solicited the August W. P. Carey Proposal and had not previously commenced a review of potential\nliquidity events for CPA:18 - Global at the time the August W. P. Carey Proposal was presented to them.\nFollowing receipt of the August W. P. Carey Proposal, the CPA:18 Independent Directors discussed forming a special committee to evaluate\npossible liquidity alternatives, including the August W. P. Carey Proposal. The CPA:18 Independent Directors discussed the need for a special\ncommittee to retain independent legal and financial advisors and discussed potential candidates for those roles. They also discussed the\nappropriate public disclosure to be made regarding their intention to consider liquidity alternatives, including the August W. P. Carey Proposal.\nOn August 31, 2021, W. P. Carey filed a Schedule 13D amendment reporting its holdings of CPA:18 Common Stock and noting that it made a\nproposal to CPA:18 - Global regarding a business combination transaction. Also, on August 31, 2021, CPA:18 - Global filed a Current Report on\nForm 8-K reporting the CPA:18 Independent Directors' intention to evaluate liquidity alternatives for CPA:18 Global, including the August W. P.\nCarey Proposal.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOn September 1, 2021, the CPA:18 Independent Directors retained Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP (\"Troutman Pepper\") to serve as legal\ncounsel to the to-be-formed special committee of CPA:18 Independent Directors.\nOn September 9, 2021, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors formed the CPA:18 Special Committee and delegated to it the authority to review\npossible liquidity alternatives. The CPA:18 Special Committee was delegated the sole authority to negotiate the terms of a transaction and to make a\nrecommendation to the full CPA:18 - Global board of directors, which could include a recommendation to approve or reject any transaction,\nincluding the August W. P. Carey Proposal. The CPA:18 Special Committee was authorized to retain, at CPA:18 - Global's expense, its own legal,\nfinancial and other advisors. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors appointed Elizabeth P. Munson and Richard J. Pinola, each of whom is a CPA:18\nIndependent Director, to the CPA:18 Special Committee, with Mr. Pinola appointed as chairman. The board of directors determined to pay each\nmember of the CPA:18 Special Committee a retainer of $75,000, to be paid in advance, and to pay the Chairman of the CPA:18 Special Committee an\nadditional retainer of $15,000, to be paid in advance. In addition, the board of directors determined, should the authorization of the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee continue after September 9, 2022, to pay each member of the CPA:18 Special Committee an annual retainer of $75,000, to be paid on such\ndate, and to pay the Chairman of the CPA:18 Special Committee an additional annual retainer of $15,000, to be paid on such date.\nOn September 9, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Clifford Chance US LLP (\"Clifford\nChance\"), counsel to CPA:18 - Global, and Troutman Pepper. The CPA:18 Special Committee reviewed its mandate and the applicable duties of a\nspecial committee under Maryland law and CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents. The CPA:18 Special Committee discussed retaining a\nfinancial advisor to assist it in its evaluation of strategic alternatives for CPA:18 - Global and decided to seek proposals and entertain presentations\nfrom investment banking firms. The CPA:18 Special Committee also discussed CPA:18 - Global's redemption queue. On August 31, 2020, the board\nof directors of CPA:18 - Global had voted that CPA:18 - Global would generally limit the amount of cash available for its quarterly redemptions to the\namount reinvested by CPA:18 Stockholders in its dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d) and would reduce its quarterly distribution rate as of the\nsecond quarter of 2020 in order to preserve cash in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 9, 2021, approximately $32.9 million of\nredemption requests were pending. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined to monitor the queue and to consider ways to address it in\nconnection with the review of liquidity alternatives for CPA:18 - Global.\nOn September 29, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting at the offices of Clifford Chance. Representatives from Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper participated in the meeting. During this meeting, the CPA:18 Special Committee interviewed candidates to serve as financial\nadvisor to the CPA:18 Special Committee. During the presentations, each candidate reviewed a range of potential strategic alternatives for CPA:18 -\nGlobal.\nOn September 30, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting with representatives of Clifford Chance and Troutman Pepper. The CPA:18\nSpecial Committee discussed the presentations received from financial advisor candidates, as well as the disclosures made by each candidate firm\nregarding any relationships such firm had with W. P. Carey. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined that engaging Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n(\"Morgan Stanley\") to advise the CPA:18 Special Committee was in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and confirmed that Morgan Stanley was\nindependent for the purposes of serving as the CPA:18 Special Committee's financial advisor. The CPA:18 Special Committee approved the retention\nof Morgan Stanley as financial advisor to the CPA:18 Special Committee, subject to entering into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley. The\nCPA:18 Special Committee noted that there was no imperative for CPA:18 - Global to undertake any liquidity event at that time. CPA:18 - Global's\nassets were continuing to generate sufficient cash flow to enable the company to cover its reduced distribution rate and the performance of certain\nassets that had been experiencing difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic was improving.\nOn October 7, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee and Morgan Stanley entered into an engagement letter to formally retain Morgan Stanley as the\nfinancial advisor to the CPA:18 Special Committee. Following this, the CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to begin its financial\nreview and valuation work on CPA:18 - Global, including analyses regarding potential strategic alternatives.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOn October 11, 2021, Mr. Park and representatives of Morgan Stanley had a call regarding the August W. P. Carey Proposal. They discussed at a\nhigh level the potential merger consideration, including the mix of cash and stock, with the potential to reduce the cash portion, on a dollar-for-\ndollar basis, by the amount of any special dividends paid by CPA:18 - Global prior to the end of the year.\nOn November 2, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper, to discuss the status of Morgan Stanley's work in support of the CPA:18 Special Committee's evaluation of strategic alternatives\nfor CPA:18 - Global, including the August W. P. Carey Proposal. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined that the August W. P. Carey Proposal\nwas not a compelling opportunity for CPA:18 - Global and its stockholders, and that the scope of the CPA:18 Special Committee's evaluation\nprocess included a full range of alternatives. The CPA:18 Special Committee determined to continue its review of a range of strategic liquidity\nalternatives for CPA:18 - Global and the optimum timing of pursuing any particular alternative. The CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan\nStanley to continue its analyses of the current value of CPA:18 - Global and potential strategic alternatives available to CPA:18 - Global. The CPA:18\nSpecial Committee also instructed Morgan Stanley to review and report on CPA:18 - Global's redemption queue and ways to potentially address the\nqueue using CPA:18 - Global's available cash, cash from asset sales and other potential alternatives.\nOn November 19, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. The Morgan Stanley representatives provided an update of their work on behalf of the CPA:18 Special Committee. The Morgan\nStanley representatives also updated the CPA:18 Special Committee on material discussions they had with representatives of W. P. Carey regarding\nW. P. Carey's proposal and W. P. Carey's plans to address the pending redemption queue. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee decided\nto defer further evaluation of strategic alternatives until after the December 9, 2021 regular quarterly meeting of the board of directors of CPA:18 -\nGlobal. The Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform W. P. Carey that the August W. P. Carey Proposal was not acceptable to the\nCPA:18 Special Committee and to point out that the proposal had expired in accordance with its terms.\nOn November 23, 2021, Mr. Fox and representatives of Morgan Stanley had a call to discuss the August W. P. Carey Proposal and whether and to\nwhat extent W. P. Carey was willing to increase its offer price.\nOn December 9, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting in the offices of W. P. Carey, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley,\nClifford Chance and Troutman Pepper. This meeting followed a regular quarterly meeting of the CPA:18 - Global board of directors. Mr. Pinola\nupdated the group on certain positive business developments in CPA:18 - Global's portfolio that had been reported at the board meeting as well as\nthe steps that CPA:18 - Global had undertaken to address its pending redemption queue in full. Mr. Pinola then reported that Mr. Fox made an oral\nproposal to increase the August W. P. Carey Proposal to a per share price of $10.05, which would be reduced by a special dividend that CPA:18 -\nGlobal expected to pay in the amount of $0.20 per share before year end. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee determined to request that\nW. P. Carey put its new proposal in a written document that would provide greater detail about the new proposal. After receipt of the written\nproposal, the CPA:18 Special Committee and advisors would determine if it was sufficient for the CPA:18 Special Committee to continue exploring\nstrategic alternatives.\nOn December 16, 2021, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Troutman Pepper and\nClifford Chance. The CPA:18 Special Committee and advisors discussed a written proposal received from W. P. Carey on December 13, 2021 to\nacquire CPA:18 - Global at a price of $9.85 per share, payable in $1.75 of cash and the balance in W. P. Carey Common Stock (the \"December W. P.\nCarey Proposal\"). The $9.85 per share price reflected an offer price of $10.05 minus a $0.20 per share dividend that CPA:18 - Global had recently\ndeclared. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee determined that the proposal lacked detail on the nature of the exchange ratio and was\nnot acceptable in its current form. The CPA:18 Special Committee requested that Morgan Stanley review the proposal in detail and the respective\nvaluations of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey in order to determine whether the CPA:18 Special Committee should continue to explore strategic\nalternatives and should make a counterproposal to W. P. Carey.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOn December 17, 2021, Mr. Fox and a representative of Morgan Stanley had a call to follow-up on the December 16 CPA:18 Special Committee\nmeeting and the committee\u2019s preliminary reaction to the December W. P. Carey Proposal.\nOn January 7, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Troutman Pepper and Clifford\nChance. The Morgan Stanley representatives provided a detailed valuation analysis regarding the December W. P. Carey Proposal. The Morgan\nStanley representatives indicated that their view of the proposal had become more favorable based on their work since the last meeting of the\nCPA:18 Special Committee, but they noted that the proposal lacked key details such as the nature of the exchange ratio. After discussing next\nsteps, the CPA:18 Special Committee expressed a preference for greater transaction price certainty in the form of more cash and decided to seek an\nimproved bid from W. P. Carey rather than to make a counterproposal. After extensive discussion among the members of the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee and the Morgan Stanley representatives, the CPA:18 Special Committee concurred with the recommendation of Morgan Stanley that\nMorgan Stanley should continue to try to improve the December W. P. Carey Proposal.\nFollowing the January 7 meeting, at the direction of the CPA:18 Special Committee, representatives of Morgan Stanley conveyed to W. P. Carey that\nthe December W. P. Carey Proposal was not compelling. The Morgan Stanley representatives recommended that W. P. Carey improve both the\namount of the proposal and the amount of cash consideration, but did not communicate a specific counterproposal, as directed by the CPA:18\nSpecial Committee. Specifically, on January 12, 2022, Mr. Fox and a representative of Morgan Stanley had a call to discuss certain information\nregarding the offer price, including whether any further increases in the offer price from W. P. Carey could include an increased cash component.\nMr. Fox and Mr. Pinola met in person on January 18, 2022, to continue discussions of the offer price. During the meeting, Mr. Pinola communicated\nto Mr. Fox a verbal counterproposal of a $10.50 per share offer price. Mr. Fox further countered with an offer price of $10.25 per share. Mr. Fox and\nMr. Pinola also spoke by telephone on a January 20, 2022, regarding the trailing volume weighted-average price (\"VWAP\") to be used to value the\nprice of W. P. Carey\u2019s common stock for the stock portion of the merger consideration, W. P. Carey\u2019s partial cash offer of $1.75 per share, and the\nviability of a 30-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period. Mr. Fox also expressed W. P. Carey\u2019s desire to maintain full discretion to sell assets and prepay mortgages of\nCPA:18 - Global during the executory period of the Merger Agreement. Later the same day, Mr. Fox sent an email to Mr. Pinola, attaching a high-\nlevel overview of proposed transaction terms, which reflected, among other things, a proposal from W. P. Carey for $10.35 per share, $2.00 of which\nwould be payable in cash and the balance payable in W. P. Carey Common Stock at a fixed exchange ratio based on the trailing 20-day VWAP of a\nshare of W. P. Carey Common Stock (the \"First January W. P. Carey Proposal\").\nOn January 21, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. Mr. Pinola updated the group on the recent discussions he had with Mr. Fox that resulted in an improved proposal from W. P.\nCarey. The Morgan Stanley representatives reviewed the First January W. P. Carey Proposal. After extensive discussion among the members of the\nCPA:18 Special Committee, the CPA:18 Special Committee authorized Morgan Stanley to engage with W. P. Carey and seek to further improve the\nproposal in terms of price and price certainty. Morgan Stanley representatives subsequently communicated this position to W. P. Carey as directed.\nOn a call between Mr. Fox and a Morgan Stanley representative on January 24, 2022, the Morgan Stanley representative relayed a counterproposal\nof the CPA:18 Special Committee for a revised offer price with an implied value of $10.45 per share, $3.00 of which would be payable in cash. The\nrepresentative also expressed the CPA:18 Special Committee\u2019s reluctance to entertain an exchange ratio based on a 20-day trailing VWAP and\nrequested a two-tiered termination fee, which would provide for payment by CPA:18 - Global of a lower percentage fee if it were to terminate the\nMerger Agreement as a result of a superior proposal made within the first thirty days following execution of the agreement by the parties.\nOn January 26, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. The CPA:18 Special Committee noted the receipt of a revised proposal from W. P. Carey reflecting (i) an increase to $2.75 per share\nin the cash component of the $10.35\n37\nTable of Contents\nper share price\u037e (ii) a potential increase in the cash component to $5.00\u037e (iii) potential asset sales by CPA:18 - Global prior to closing of the proposal\ntransaction\u037e and (iv) an exchange ratio for the stock component to be determined (the \"Second January W. P. Carey Proposal\"). The Morgan\nStanley representatives reported on discussions they had with representatives of W. P. Carey. After extensive discussion among the members of\nthe CPA:18 Special Committee and its advisors, the CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to inform W. P. Carey's representatives\nthat the CPA:18 Special Committee would view the per share price of $10.35 favorably if the cash component were increased to $5.00 and the parties\ncould agree on a satisfactory exchange ratio.\nOver the next several days, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of W. P. Carey engaged in discussions regarding the Second\nJanuary W. P. Carey Proposal. Representatives of W. P. Carey also contacted Mr. Pinola directly to discuss the proposal.\nOn February 7, 2022, DLA Piper LLP (US) (\u201cDLA Piper\u201d) (legal advisors to W. P. Carey) sent a draft merger agreement to Clifford Chance. The draft\nagreement reflected an increase in the cash component to $3.00 but still reflected an overall price of $10.35 per share of CPA:18 Common Stock. The\ndraft included a right for W. P. Carey unilaterally to cause CPA:18 - Global to sell certain assets prior to the closing of the merger at prices\ndetermined by W. P. Carey, and to extend the closing date for up to 30 days to allow W. P. Carey to cause CPA:18 - Global to complete the asset\nsales. The draft agreement provided for a waiver of certain fees and distributions that would potentially be payable to W. P. Carey as advisor in\nconnection with a merger of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey. The draft also contemplated termination fees of 1.5% for certain alternative\ntransactions proposed by bidders identified during a go-shop process and 3.5% for other alternative transactions.\nOn February 9, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. The group discussed the draft merger agreement received from DLA Piper. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee\ninstructed Morgan Stanley to inform W. P. Carey that (i) the CPA:18 Special Committee would view the $10.35 price favorably if the cash component\nwere increased to $5.00\u037e and (ii) the CPA:18 Special Committee would be reasonable in considering the provisions in the draft agreement that\nappeared to be intended to provide W. P. Carey with flexibility to generate cash from asset sales to fund an increased cash component of the merger\nconsideration.\nOn February 17, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. Mr. Pinola and the representatives of Morgan Stanley reported on recent discussions they had with representatives of W. P.\nCarey in which the W. P. Carey representatives offered to increase the cash component from $3.00 to $3.50, while maintaining a $10.35 price per\nshare. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee instructed Morgan Stanley to seek to improve the price per share to $10.45.\nOn February 18, 2022, Mr. Fox contacted Mr. Pinola and proposed that W. P. Carey would acquire CPA:18 - Global at a price of $10.45 per share, of\nwhich $3.00 would be paid in cash. After discussion among the CPA:18 Special Committee and its advisors, the CPA:18 Special Committee\ndetermined that the price and its components were acceptable provided that a satisfactory definitive merger agreement could be reached. Clifford\nChance circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement for review by DLA Piper. The revised draft contemplated that any permitted asset sales\nprior to closing would have to meet minimum reserve prices, W. P. Carey would have no unilateral right to extend the closing date, the termination\nfees would be 1.0% and 3.0%, and any termination fee would be credited against advisory fees and special general partner distributions payable to\nW. P. Carey in the event of a third-party transaction.\nBetween February 18, 2022 and February 27, 2022, representatives of Clifford Chance and Troutman Pepper, on behalf of CPA:18 - Global and the\nCPA:18 Special Committee, and DLA Piper, on behalf of W. P. Carey, exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and held several negotiation\nsessions regarding the issues described above, and other terms of the merger agreement and ancillary agreements.\nOn February 23, 2022, the W. P. Carey board of directors met via videoconference, at which representatives of W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management,\nBofA Securities and DLA Piper were present. At this meeting, representatives of W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management updated the W. P. Carey board of\ndirectors on the status of the ongoing\n38\nTable of Contents\ndiscussions and negotiations regarding the potential transaction with CPA:18 - Global, including a summary of the key transaction terms in the near\nfinal merger agreement, a summary of the key open issues that remained the subject of ongoing negotiations, and management\u2019s views on the\ntransaction. Representatives of BofA Securities then reviewed with the W. P. Carey board of directors the key financial terms of the merger\nagreement.\nOn February 25, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. A representative of Venable LLP joined the meeting to advise the members of CPA:18 Special Committee as to their duties under\nMaryland law with respect to the proposed transaction and related matters. The CPA:18 Special Committee then reviewed the benefits and\nconsiderations of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Clifford Chance next reviewed an overview of the proposed transaction, including\nthe material provisions contained in a February 24, 2022 draft merger agreement prepared on behalf of CPA:18 - Global. The Clifford Chance\nrepresentatives highlighted the issues that remained open between the parties. These issues primarily related to determination of the share\nexchange ratio, W. P. Carey's right to extend the closing date and the amounts of the reserve prices for asset sales.\nThe Morgan Stanley representatives next discussed in detail with the CPA:18 Special Committee valuation analyses of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey,\nand the proposed transaction, together with supporting data. The Morgan Stanley representatives provided an overview of the proposed merger, a\nvaluation analysis of CPA:18 - Global, the W. P. Carey pro forma capitalization after the merger, and various accretion (dilution) analyses of the\nproposed merger, noting, among other benefits, that the proposed transaction would be accretive to CPA:18 Stockholders on a dividends basis,\nassuming reinvestment in W. P. Carey common stock of the cash portion of the consideration received. The CPA:18 Special Committee then\ndiscussed the various alternatives to the proposed transaction which it had previously considered, including maintaining the status quo and not\npursuing a liquidity alternative at the current time, a sale to a third party for cash, an initial public offering or stock exchange listing of CPA:18 -\nGlobal (including the internalization of CPA:18 - Global's management function), the liquidation of CPA:18 - Global's assets, and the consideration of\npotential acquisition bidders in addition to W. P. Carey. After discussion, and with input from its financial and legal advisors, the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee concluded that the available alternatives were not as favorable to CPA:18 Stockholders as the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey if it\ncould be successfully negotiated to a satisfactory conclusion, and that additional bidders could be effectively pursued through the go-shop\nprocess permitted by the merger agreement.\nThe CPA:18 Special Committee then determined to continue its evaluation of the proposed transaction and directed its advisors to seek to finalize\nthe terms of the merger agreement in order for the CPA:18 Special Committee to make a determination of whether it would recommend to the CPA:18\n- Global board that the proposed transaction was advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, was fair and\nreasonable to CPA:18 - Global, and was on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties.\nThe parties' legal and financial advisors proceeded to seek to finalize the terms of the proposed merger and merger agreement over the next couple\nof days.\nOn February 26, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. Clifford Chance and Morgan Stanley provided updates on the remaining open issues, which primarily centered on W. P. Carey's\ndesire for a right to extend the closing date in order to permit the closing of the sale of a specified portfolio and the consideration that should be\npaid to CPA:18 - Global's stockholders for such right. The CPA:18 Special Committee provided direction to the advisors to continue to adhere to the\nCPA:18 Special Committee's position that the cash portion of the merger consideration should be increased by an accrued amount if there were to\nbe a delay of the closing date. Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed alternative potential exchange ratios based on various VWAP\ncalculations and the CPA:18 Special Committee selected 0.0978x as its preferred exchange ratio. Finally, the CPA 18: Special Committee and its\nadvisors discussed the current global circumstances resulting from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and their potential impact on W. P. Carey and\nCPA:18 Global. After discussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee, with the concurrence of its advisors, determined that the current global\ncircumstances did not make the proposed merger transaction inadvisable if it could be successfully negotiated to a satisfactory conclusion.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOn February 27, 2022, representatives of Clifford Chance distributed substantially final versions of the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents\nto the CPA:18 Special Committee, indicating the resolution of the open issues that had been discussed with the CPA:18 Special Committee at its\nFebruary 25 and 26, 2022 meetings. Representatives of Morgan Stanley presented their valuation analyses, which were substantially similar to\nthose reviewed with the CPA:18 Special Committee on February 25, 2022.\nOn February 27, 2022, a meeting of the W. P. Carey board of directors, at which representatives of W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management, BofA Securities\nand DLA Piper were present, was held via videoconference. Representatives of W. P. Carey\u2019s senior management, representatives of BofA\nSecurities and representatives of DLA Piper summarized the negotiations that had taken place and reviewed the Per Share Merger Consideration to\nbe paid by W. P. Carey. Representatives of DLA Piper reviewed with the W. P. Carey board the terms of the Merger Agreement. Representatives of\nBofA Securities reviewed with the W. P. Carey board of directors the key financial terms of the Merger. The W. P Carey board discussed the terms of\nthe agreements and the representatives of W. P. Carey management, BofA Securities and DLA Piper answered the W. P. Carey directors\u2019 questions.\nAfter discussion and taking into account the factors described under \u201c-W. P. Carey\u2019s Reasons for the Merger,\u201d beginning on page 41, the W. P.\nCarey board determined by unanimous vote that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, were\nadvisable, fair, and in the best interests of W. P. Carey and its stockholders, and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger.\nOn February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance and\nTroutman Pepper. The CPA:18 Special Committee reviewed the final terms of the proposed transaction and the proposed resolution of all material\nopen issues. The CPA:18 Special Committee then reviewed Morgan Stanley's disclosure of relationships with W. P. Carey and confirmed that the\nCPA:18 Special Committee was satisfied with the independence of Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley representatives then summarized their\nupdated valuation analyses of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and the Merger, reviewed the list of third parties initially anticipated to be contacted in\nthe go-shop process, and confirmed that the data room to be used for the go-shop process was populated and ready for use. At the request of the\nCPA:18 Special Committee, Morgan Stanley then delivered to the CPA:18 Special Committee its oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing)\nthat, as of February 27, 2022 and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley's opinion, the Per Share Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point\nof view to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of Excluded Shares).\nThe CPA:18 Special Committee then discussed the various benefits and other considerations respecting the proposed transaction, and, after\ndiscussion, the CPA:18 Special Committee determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are\nadvisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global\nand on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties. The CPA:18 Special Committee also determined\nthat CPA:18 - Global's distribution reinvestment and redemption programs would be suspended until the closing of the Merger, except that special\ncircumstances redemptions in respect of a stockholder who had died or become disabled would continue. By unanimous vote, the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee adopted resolutions making declarations to the same effect and recommended to the CPA:18 - Global board of directors that it adopt\nresolutions and direct the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be submitted for consideration at a special\nmeeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders.\nImmediately following the CPA:18 Special Committee meeting on February 27, 2022, the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global held a meeting to\napprove the transaction with W. P. Carey, at which the financial and legal advisors of the CPA:18 Special Committee were also present.\nRepresentatives from Clifford Chance described the resolutions that had been adopted by the CPA:18 Special Committee at the meeting prior to the\nboard meeting. The CPA:18 Special Committee informed the board that the Morgan Stanley fairness opinion was for the information of the board as\nwell as the CPA:18 Special Committee. Following deliberations, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent\ndirectors) determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of\nCPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and on terms and conditions at\n40\nTable of Contents\nleast as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors adopted resolutions making declarations\nto the same effect, among other resolutions, and directed the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be\nsubmitted for consideration at a special meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders. Jason E. Fox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey,\nabstained from voting on the matters.\nOn Sunday, February 27, 2022, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global executed and delivered the Merger Agreement and certain ancillary documents.\nOn February 28, 2022, W. P. Carey issued a press release announcing the proposed transaction.\nOn February 28, 2022, CPA:18 - Global issued a press release announcing the proposed transaction.\nCommencing on February 28, 2022, representatives from Morgan Stanley, under the direction of the CPA:18 Special Committee, contacted a total of\n19 strategic and financial firms that might have an interest in submitting a proposal to acquire CPA:18 - Global during the go-shop period. These\ncontacts resulted in 5 parties negotiating and entering into confidentiality agreements with CPA:18 - Global and receiving access to the diligence\nmaterials in the virtual data room.\nOn March 4, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held a telephonic meeting, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance\nand Troutman Pepper. The representatives from Morgan Stanley provided an update on the market reaction to the announcement of the proposed\ntransaction and reviewed with the CPA:18 Special Committee the status of the go-shop process.\nOn March 11, 18, 25, and 31, 2022, the CPA:18 Special Committee held meetings, together with representatives from Morgan Stanley, Clifford Chance\nand Troutman Pepper. The representatives from Morgan Stanley provided a detailed report on the status of the go-shop process. The go-shop\nperiod expired on March 30, 2022. CPA:18 - Global did not receive any proposals for an alternative transaction as of the expiration of the go-shop\nperiod.\nW. P. Carey's Reasons for the Merger",

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by\nthe W. P. Carey board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but rather summarizes the material factors considered by the W. P.

Jason E.\nFox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, abstained from voting on the matters. In making their determination, the CPA:18 - Global\nboard of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee considered a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022the expectation that the proposed transaction with W.

        "Section Text": "CPA:18 - Global's Reasons for the Merger\nAt a meeting on February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors) and the CPA:18\nSpecial Committee adopted resolutions declaring that the Merger is (A) advisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the stockholders\nof CPA:18 - Global, (B) fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global and (C) on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from\nunaffiliated third parties, and directing that the Merger be submitted for consideration at a special meeting of the CPA:18 Stockholders. Jason E.\nFox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, abstained from voting on the matters. In making their determination, the CPA:18 - Global\nboard of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee considered a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022the expectation that the proposed transaction with W. P. Carey will provide liquidity to CPA:18 - Global's stockholders by delivering to them cash\nand shares in a publicly traded company with a broad stockholder base, and with no lock-ups or other restrictions on transfer on the shares\u037e\n\u2022the Per Share Merger Consideration implies a premium of 17% and 15% to CPA:18 - Global's most recently published estimated NAV per share of\n$9.07 at September 30, 2021, based on the closing price of W. P. Carey Common Stock of $77.66 on February 25, 2022 (the last trading day prior to\nthe announcement of the Merger) and the 3-day volume-weighted average price of $76.17 for the three days ending on and including February 25,\n2022, respectively\u037e\n\u2022the dividend that the CPA:18 Stockholders will receive on the stock consideration, based on W. P. Carey's existing dividend rate will be slightly\nincreased\u037e\n\u2022the cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is fixed and won't decline based on declines in the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock\u037e\n43Table of Contents\n\u2022the expectation that the combined company will be among the largest publicly traded REITs with an expected enterprise value of approximately\n$23.4 billion and total market capitalization of approximately $15.7 billion, and a more diversified portfolio of approximately 1,338 properties with 164\nmillion square feet of corporate real estate leased to approximately 380 companies around the world\u037e as a result of its larger size and enhanced\nbalance sheet, the combined company is expected to have greater operating and financial flexibility and better access to capital markets with a lower\ncost of capital than CPA:18 - Global on a standalone basis\u037e\n\u2022subject to the discussion below regarding the receipt of cash consideration, the receipt of the stock consideration in the Merger will be tax-\ndeferred to CPA:18 Stockholders, until such time as such shares of W. P. Carey are sold\u037e\n\u2022the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee each concluded, after consideration and review with its legal and\nfinancial advisors, that the transaction with W. P. Carey was superior to other possible liquidity alternatives for a number of reasons, including the\nview that:\n\u25e6the current opportunities for an initial public offering or a public listing are not favorable, particularly for diversified REITs that are externally\nmanaged\u037e\n\u25e6it could be challenging to retain a management team in order to pursue a listing as an internally managed REIT\u037e\n\u25e6a sale of CPA:18 - Global's entire portfolio to unrelated third parties may involve difficulties in obtaining consents from lenders and may require\nAdvisor Closing Amounts\u037e\n\u25e6there was a low probability that a third party would have the desire or ability to merge with CPA:18 - Global or otherwise acquire its entire portfolio\nand related debt at a value comparable to the proposed Merger, including as a result of the large size and diversified nature of the portfolio in\naddition to the joint interests of CPA:18 and W. P. Carey (and the lack of response from third parties during a go-shop period, which confirmed this\nview)\u037e\n\u25e6a liquidation over an extended period would require CPA:18 - Global to continue to incur expenses, including fixed operating expenses that are not\ntied to the size of CPA:18 - Global's asset base, which would reduce the total net amount realized from the liquidation\u037e and\n\u25e6the costs associated with separate sales of each property could become significant, thus decreasing returns to CPA:18 Stockholders\u037e\n\u2022after the proposed transaction, the combined company would have greater geographic diversification and greater tenant diversification than\nCPA:18 - Global on a standalone basis, which could provide the combined company with greater cash flow stability\u037e\n\u2022the CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee each believe that the quality of the combined company's earnings will be\nimproved by the Merger because substantially all of the combined company's AFFO will come from recurring real estate income\u037e this improvement\nmay result in the combined company trading at a higher multiple of earnings\u037e\n\u2022the projected payout ratio will decrease, resulting in dividends of a higher quality, which may result in greater dividend growth over time than\nwithout the Merger\u037e\n\u2022CPA:18 Stockholders will have ownership of approximately 7% of the combined company, and continued ownership of shares in the combined\ncompany will provide the opportunity for CPA:18 Stockholders to benefit from potential increases in the price of W. P. Carey Common Stock after\nthe closing date\u037e\n\u2022there is no active public trading market for CPA:18 Common Stock and CPA:18 - Global's redemption plan includes numerous restrictions that limit\nCPA:18 Stockholders' ability to sell their shares to CPA:18 - Global, and the price received for any CPA:18 Common Stock pursuant to CPA:18 -\nGlobal's redemption\n44\nTable of Contents\nplan (assuming such redemption is available) would be at a 7% discount to CPA:18 - Global's estimated NAV per share of $9.07 at September 30,\n2021 (absent it being a special circumstances redemption)\u037e\n\u2022the Per Share Merger Consideration and the other terms of the Merger Agreement resulted from arm's length negotiations between the CPA:18\nSpecial Committee and W. P. Carey, with the assistance of their respective advisors\u037e\n\u2022W. P. Carey will continue to be self-managed, thereby eliminating the external advisory structure under which CPA:18 - Global presently operates\u037e\n\u2022the ability of CPA:18 - Global under the Merger Agreement, during the go-shop period, to seek acquisition proposals from third parties\u037e\n\u2022the ability of CPA:18 - Global under the Merger Agreement, after the go-shop period, to engage in negotiations with third parties in response to\nunsolicited acquisition proposals under certain circumstances\u037e\n\u2022the ability of CPA:18 - Global to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal prior to the time that the CPA:18 Stockholders\napprove the Merger, subject to payment of a termination fee of $15.7 million (1.0% of the equity value of the Merger) for a transaction with a\nqualified third party pursuant to the go-shop procedures and $47.0 million (3.0% of the equity value of the Merger) for a transaction with a third\nparty as a result of an unsolicited offer outside the go-shop procedures\u037e\n\u2022the fact that, in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a superior competing transaction, the termination fee is fully\ncreditable against the Advisor Closing Amounts payable to W.

P. Carey and the holders\nof the Excluded Shares)\u037e and\n\u2022the Merger is subject to the approval of CPA:18 Stockholders who therefore have the option to reject the Merger.\nThe CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee also considered a number of potentially negative factors about the\nMerger, including:\n\u2022the challenges inherent in the combination of two business enterprises that are the size of CPA:18 - Global and W.

In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to\ndifferent factors. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors and the CPA:18 Special Committee considered the positive and negative factors relating to\nthe Merger and the related transactions and believed the negative factors to be materially outweighed by the positive factors.\n46",

The CPA:18 Special Committee selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, expertise\nand reputation, and its knowledge of the business and affairs of CPA:18 - Global. As part of this engagement, the CPA:18 Special Committee\nrequested that Morgan Stanley evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the holders of shares\nof CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the shares held by W. P. Carey or any subsidiary of W. P. Carey (which shares we refer to as\nExcluded Shares)).

P. Carey and the holders of the Excluded Shares).\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated February 27, 2022, is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B, and is\nhereby incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan\nStanley in rendering its opinion. The summary of the opinion of Morgan Stanley in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to, and should, read Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and this section summarizing Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion carefully and in their entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was directed to the CPA:18 Special Committee, in its capacity as such,\nand addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of CPA:18\nCommon Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the holders of the Excluded Shares), as of the date of the opinion, and did not address any other\naspects or implications of the Merger. It was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder of CPA:18 -\nGlobal as to how to act or vote in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did\nnot in any manner address the prices at which the W. P. Carey Common Stock will trade following consummation of the Merger or at any time.\nIn connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\n\u2022reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey,\nrespectively\u037e\n\u2022reviewed certain internal financial statements and other business, financial and operating data, concerning CPA:18 - Global and W. P.

P. Carey and their financial and legal\nadvisors\u037e\n\u2022reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents\u037e and\n\u2022performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, and formed a substantial\nbasis for its opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits\nanticipated from the Merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available\nestimates and judgments of the respective managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey of the future financial performance of CPA:18 - Global\nand W. P. Carey. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger\nAgreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Merger will be treated as a\ntax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and that the definitive Merger Agreement would not differ in\nany material respects from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the\nnecessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will\nbe imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Morgan Stanley relied\nupon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey of: (i) the strategic, financial and\nother benefits expected to result from the Merger\u037e and (ii) the timing and risks associated with the integration of CPA:18 - Global and W. P.

Carey and CPA:18 - Global and their legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.

P. Carey and the holders of the Excluded Shares). Morgan Stanley was advised by the\nCPA:18 Special Committee that W. P. Carey has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust\n(\u201cREIT\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes since its formation as a REIT and Morgan Stanley has assumed that the Merger will not adversely\naffect such status or operations of W. P. Carey. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of\nCPA:18 - Global or W. P. Carey, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on\nfinancial, economic, market, tax and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of February 27, 2022.\nEvents occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not\nassume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition,\nbusiness combination or other extraordinary transaction, involving CPA:18 - Global, nor did Morgan Stanley negotiate with any of the parties, other\nthan W.

Carey.\nSummary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation\nof its opinion letter to the CPA:18 Special Committee, dated February 27, 2022. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order\nof analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include\ninformation presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read\ntogether with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in\nthe tables and described below must be considered as a whole. Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without\nconsidering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nFurthermore, mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to\nbelow.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon certain financial\nprojections provided by the managements of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey and that are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the\n\u201cfinancial projections,\u201d and extrapolations of such financial projections, as described in greater detail in the section of this proxy\nstatement/prospectus titled \u201cProspective Financial Information,\u201d and certain financial projections based on Wall Street research.\nDividend Discount Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a dividend discount analysis to calculate a range of implied present values of the future forecasted dividends and an\nestimated \u201cterminal value\u201d for CPA:18 Common Stock. The range was determined by adding:\n\u2022the present value (as of December 31, 2021) of estimated future dividends for CPA:18 - Global over a period of 60 months from January 1, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2026 based on CPA:18 - Global\u2019s projected estimated dividends per share for those periods\u037e and\n\u2022the present value (as of December 31, 2021) of an estimated \u201cterminal value\u201d of CPA:18 Common Stock at the end of the year 2026.\nIn performing its analysis, Morgan Stanley used a discount rate of 8.3% to 10.3%, derived from a cost of equity calculation utilizing the capital asset\npricing model. The terminal value for CPA:18 Common Stock was calculated by applying a selected range of terminal AFFO multiples of 16.0x to\n18.0x, the midpoint of which was based on comparing the weighted average of historical next twelve months (NTM) AFFO trading multiples over\nthe last ten years of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Net Lease and Self-Storage REIT Peers, to Morgan Stanley\u2019s calculation of estimated 2027 AFFO per share of\nCPA:18 - Global of $0.58. CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Net Lease REIT Peers consisted of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc., Lexington Realty Trust, STAG Industrial,\nInc., and W. P. Carey. CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Self-Storage REIT peers include CubeSmart, Extra Space Storage Inc., Life Storage, Inc., National Storage\nAffiliates Trust, and Public Storage. This analysis resulted in the following implied per share equity value range for CPA:18 - Global:\nImplied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range\n$8.50 to $9.92\nComparable Public Companies Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a comparable company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded.\n49\nTable of Contents\nMorgan Stanley reviewed and compared, using publicly available information, certain current and historical financial information for CPA:18 -\nGlobal and financial projections with corresponding current and historical financial information, certain financial projections based on Wall Street\nresearch reports, ratios and public market multiples for selected companies that, based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience,\nshare similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics. The companies that were reviewed in connection with\nthis analysis were CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Diversified Peers, Office / Industrial Peers and Self-Storage Peers.\nFor purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated and analyzed the following statistics of each of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Diversified Peers, Office\n/ Industrial Peers and Self-Storage Peers, based on the closing share prices on February 25, 2022 (the date of Morgan Stanley\u2019s valuation analysis\nof CPA:18 - Global) and publicly available financial data, for comparison purposes:\n\u2022such company\u2019s estimated AFFO for calendar year 2022, based on publicly available equity research estimates\u037e\n\u2022such company\u2019s estimated gross asset value, or GAV, based on publicly available equity research estimates\u037e\n\u2022such company\u2019s estimated net asset value, or NAV, based on publicly available equity research estimates\u037e\n\u2022the ratios of such company\u2019s share price to estimated 2022 AFFO, estimated GAV and estimated NAV.\nMorgan Stanley then used these multiple ranges to derive separate implied per share equity value reference ranges for CPA:18 - Global using each\nof the metrics reviewed by applying the range derived from the comparable companies for each metric to the corresponding CPA:18 - Global metric,\nas provided by CPA:18 - Global\u2019s management.\nBelow are descriptions of the adjustments made to determine adjusted GAV and adjusted NAV for these metrics:\nAdjusted Gross Asset Value\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the GAV estimates of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s assets prepared and published by Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (\u201cStanger\u201d) and\nadjusted that estimate for other factors not included in their estimate, which adjustments were approved by the CPA:18 Special Committee.

In evaluating comparable companies, Morgan Stanley\nmade judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other\nmatters, which are beyond CPA:18 - Global\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on CPA:18 - Global and the\nindustry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of CPA:18 - Global,\nthe industry, or the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not, in itself, a meaningful\nmethod of using comparable company data.\nGeneral\nMorgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial\nopinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan\nStanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered.\nMorgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of\nthe process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight\nthan other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges\nof valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s view of the actual value of CPA:18\n- Global or W. P. Carey.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond CPA:18 - Global\u2019s or W. P. Carey\u2019s control. These include,\namong other things, the impact of competition on CPA:18 - Global\u2019s businesses and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any\nadverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and the industry, and in the financial markets in\ngeneral. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view of the Per Share\nMerger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement to the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (other than W. P. Carey and the\nholders of the Excluded Shares) and in connection with the delivery of its opinion as of February 27, 2022, to the CPA:18 Special Committee. These\n51\nTable of Contents\nanalyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock might actually trade.\nThe Per Share Merger Consideration was determined through negotiations on an arms-length basis between the CPA:18 Special Committee and the\nBoard of Directors of W. P. Carey and was unanimously approved by each of CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Board of Directors, following the unanimous\nrecommendation of the CPA:18 Special Committee, and W. P. Carey\u2019s Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the CPA:18 Special\nCommittee during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the CPA:18 Special Committee, nor did\nMorgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration to be received by CPA:18 - Global\u2019s stockholders constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration for the Merger.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the CPA:18 Special Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the CPA:18\nSpecial Committee in deciding to recommend to CPA:18 - Global\u2019s Board of Directors to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the recommendation\nof the CPA:18 Special Committee, with respect to the consideration to be received by CPA:18 - Global\u2019s stockholders pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement or of whether the CPA:18 Special Committee would have been willing to agree to a different form or amount of consideration.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s customary practice.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, express an opinion or a recommendation as to how any stockholder of CPA:18 -\nGlobal should act or vote in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not\naddress any other aspect of the Merger, including the prices at which shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will trade following consummation of\nthe Merger or at any time.\nMorgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management\nbusinesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and\nderivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its\naffiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance\npositions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity\nsecurities or loans of W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any\nrelated derivative instrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the CPA:18 Special Committee with financial advisory services and a financial\nopinion, and CPA:18 - Global has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an aggregate fee of $6,000,000, of which $1,500,000 was payable upon CPA:18 -\nGlobal entering into a definitive agreement with respect to the Merger and $4,500,000 is payable upon the closing of the Merger. In addition, the\nengagement letter provides for an additional fee of up to $4,000,000 payable in the sole discretion of the CPA:18 Special Committee based on\nperformance. CPA:18 - Global has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other\nprofessional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, CPA:18 - Global has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its\naffiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates\nagainst certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, relating to or arising out of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s engagement.\nIn the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not provided financial advisory or financing services for\nCPA:18 - Global or W. P. Carey for which it received any fees. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may seek to provide financial advisory and financing\nservices to CPA:18 - Global and W. P.

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nPOTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nA number of conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationship between W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global. In considering the recommendation of\nthe board of directors of CPA:18 - Global to approve the Merger, CPA:18 Stockholders should be aware that potential conflicts of interest exist\nbecause W. P. Carey and its affiliates serve as the advisor for CPA:18 - Global, the companies share common management, and the officers and\ndirectors of W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global may have certain interests in the proposed transactions that are different from or in addition to the\ninterests of CPA:18 Stockholders generally. The board of directors of CPA:18 - Global recognized these conflicts and additional interests and the\nneed to independently determine that the Merger is in the best interests of CPA:18- Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders. Therefore, the board of\ndirectors of CPA:18 - Global formed a special committee comprised entirely of independent directors, and the CPA:18 Special Committee engaged its\nown independent legal and financial advisors. Certain of these potential conflicts and interests are highlighted below.\nAdvisory Relationship and Common Management\nW. P. Carey's subsidiary, CAM, and its affiliates serve as the external advisor for CPA:18 - Global. Additionally, the executive management of CPA:18\n- Global is comprised of the same individuals as the executive management of W. P. Carey. W. P. Carey, in its role as advisor to CPA:18 - Global,\nperformed an initial review of potential liquidity alternatives for CPA:18 - Global. In addition, the CPA:18 Special Committee's financial advisor relied,\nin part, on financial information and property information provided by W. P. Carey in conducting their respective analyses.\nTo help alleviate potential conflicts, the board of directors of CPA:18 - Global created the CPA:18 Special Committee. The CPA:18 Special Committee\nwas delegated the sole authority to negotiate the terms of a transaction and to make a recommendation to the full board of directors, which could\ninclude a recommendation to reject any transaction. The CPA:18 Special Committee was authorized to retain its own legal and financial advisors.\nThe CPA:18 - Global board of directors appointed all of its independent directors to the CPA:18 Special Committee.\nFees Payable by CPA:18 - Global to Its Advisor and Other Affiliates of W. P. Carey in Connection with the Merger\nConditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, W. P. Carey has waived all rights to receive any and all\nAdvisor Closing Amounts. In addition, W. P. Carey will receive no disposition fees in respect of the consummation of the Merger.\nW. P. Carey and its affiliates will continue to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements and\nthe CPA:18 LP Agreement prior to the closing of the Merger. At December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey had accrued and unpaid fees of approximately $1.1\nmillion pursuant to the CPA:18 Advisory Agreements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey earned approximately $12.5\nmillion in asset management fees and $7.3 million in Special General Partner distributions from CPA:18 - Global.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with a CPA:18 Superior Competing Transaction, W. P. Carey may be entitled to receive a\ntermination fee and the Advisor Closing Amounts, subject to a credit of the lesser of the termination fee paid and the Special GP Amount. See the\nsection titled \"The Merger Agreement\" beginning on page 97.\nOwnership of CPA:18 - Global Shares\nAs of April 27, 2022 (the \"CPA:18 Record Date\"), W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries, and its directors and executive officers, owned 8,556,733 shares\nof CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate (equal to approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock). As of the CPA:18\nRecord Date, the directors of CPA:18 - Global beneficially owned 76,223 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate, representing less than\n1.0% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and\nany of their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between\nCPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its\n56\nTable of Contents\nadvisor\u037e and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the\nMerger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the\nmatter and will not be included in making such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global\ndirector, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the\nrequisite approval. Each share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the\neffective time of the Merger will automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.\nCombined Company Board of Directors\nThe directors and officers of W. P. Carey immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will continue to be the directors and officers of W. P.\nCarey after the Merger. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the directors of W. P. Carey as a group received cash and equity\ncompensation of $2.5 million. For additional information regarding the directors and executive officers of W. P. Carey following the Merger, please\nrefer to W. P. Carey's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for its 2022 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on March 28, 2022,\nwhich is incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.\nJoint Ventures and Other Transactions with Affiliates\nW. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global and Carey European Student Housing Fund I, L.P. (\u201cCESH\u201d) share leased office space used for the administration of\ntheir operations. Rental and occupancy related costs are allocated among the parties and their affiliates based on their respective advisory\nagreements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global owned interests ranging from 5% to 99% in jointly owned investments in real estate, with\nthe remaining interests held by affiliates or third parties.\n57",

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nINFORMATION ABOUT CPA:18 - GLOBAL\nSet forth below is a description of the business of CPA:18 - Global. When used in this section, unless otherwise specifically stated or the context\nrequires otherwise, the terms \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" refer to CPA:18 - Global and its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors.\nGeneral Development of Business\nCorporate Property Associates 18 - Global Incorporated (\u201cCPA:18 - Global\u201d) and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, we, us, or our, is a\npublicly owned, non-traded REIT that invests in a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial properties net-leased to companies, both\ndomestically and outside the United States. In addition, our portfolio includes operating self-storage and student housing investments. As a REIT,\nwe are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to the portion of our income that is distributed annually to our stockholders as long\nas we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income and the level of our distributions, among other factors. We\nconduct substantially all of our investment activities and own all of our assets through CPA:18 Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership,\nwhich is our Operating Partnership. In addition to being a general partner and a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, we also own a 99.97%\ncapital interest in the Operating Partnership. WPC-CPA:18 Holdings, LLC (\u201cCPA:18 Holdings\u201d or the \u201cSpecial General Partner\u201d), a subsidiary of\nour sponsor, W. P. Carey Inc. (\u201cW. P. Carey\u201d), holds the remaining 0.03% special general partner interest in the Operating Partnership.\nNarrative Description of Business\nBusiness Objectives and Strategy\nOur primary business objectives are to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, seek investments with potential for capital\nappreciation, use leverage to enhance returns on our investments, and generate sufficient cash flow over time to provide investors with increasing\ndistributions. Our business operates in three reportable business segments: Net Lease, Self Storage, and Other Operating Properties.\nOur investment strategy primarily focuses on owning and managing a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate that is net-leased to credit-worthy\ncompanies. Net-leased properties generally require the tenant to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the\nproperty (such as real estate taxes, insurance, and facility maintenance), and compared to other types of real estate investments, typically produce a\nmore predictable income stream and require minimal capital expenditures, which in turn generate revenues that provide our stockholders with a\nstable, growing source of income. We also invest in self-storage facilities, which generate revenue from rents received from customers who rent\nstorage space, primarily under month-to-month leases for personal or business use, as well as student housing investments, which generate\nrevenue from leases of one year or less with individual students.\nOn December 20, 2019, we executed a framework agreement with a third party to enter into 11 net lease agreements for our student housing\nproperties located in Spain and Portugal for 25 years upon completion of construction (collectively, our \u201cIberian student housing portfolio\u201d or\n\u201cIberian student housing projects\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, we have placed into service nine student housing properties, and the remaining two\nstudent housing projects under construction will become subject to net lease agreements upon their completion and are scheduled to do so in 2022\nand 2023. Under the terms of the framework agreement, the third-party lessee of the portfolio has the right to purchase the portfolio at pre-\ndetermined prices if CPA:18 - Global engages in certain transactions, including the Merger. The third-party lessee has exercised its option to\npurchase the Iberian student housing portfolio.\nWe are managed by W. P. Carey through certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, our \u201cadvisor\u201d). W. P. Carey is a diversified REIT and leading owner\nof commercial real estate listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cWPC.\u201d In addition, W. P. Carey also manages the CESH\nportfolio. Pursuant to an advisory agreement, our advisor provides both strategic and day-to-day management services for us, including asset\nmanagement, dispositions of assets, investor relations, investment research and analysis, investment financing and other investment-related\nservices, and administrative services. Our advisor also provides office space and other facilities\n59\nTable of Contents\nfor us. We pay asset management fees and certain transactional fees to our advisor and also reimburse our advisor for certain expenses incurred in\nproviding services to us, including expenses associated with personnel provided for administration of our operations. As of December 31, 2021, the\ncurrent advisory agreement has been renewed through March 31, 2022. Our advisor also serves in this capacity with CESH, a limited partnership\nformed for the purpose of developing, owning, and operating student housing properties in Europe.\nWe were formed as a Maryland corporation on September 7, 2012. We commenced our initial public offering in May 2013 and raised aggregate gross\nproceeds of $1.2 billion through the closing of the offering in April 2015, which have been fully invested. In addition, from inception through\nDecember 31, 2021, $220.4 million and $63.7 million of distributions to our stockholders were reinvested in our Class A and Class C common stock,\nrespectively, through our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d).\nOur estimated net asset values per share (\u201cNAVs\u201d) as of September 30, 2021 were $9.07 per share for both Class A and Class C common stock.\nWe have no employees. As of December 31, 2021, our advisor had 183 employees available to perform services under our advisory agreement.\nOur Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2021, our net lease portfolio was comprised of full or partial ownership interests in 53 properties, substantially all of which were\nfully occupied and triple-net leased to 50 tenants, and totaled approximately 10.4 million square feet. The remainder of our portfolio was comprised\nof full or partial ownership interests in 65 self-storage properties, three student housing development projects, and one student housing operating\nproperty, totaling 5.1 million square feet.\nAsset Management\nOur advisor is generally responsible for all aspects of our operations, including selecting our investments, formulating and evaluating the terms of\neach proposed acquisition, arranging for the acquisition of the investment, negotiating the terms of borrowings, managing our day-to-day\noperations, and arranging for and negotiating sales of assets. With respect to our net-leased investments, asset management functions include\nentering into new or modified transactions to meet the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, credit and real estate risk analysis,\nbuilding expansions and redevelopments, refinancing debt, and strategic dispositions. With respect to our self-storage and student housing\ninvestments, asset management functions include engaging unaffiliated third parties for management and operation of our investments, active\noversight of property developers and managers, credit and real estate risk analysis, building expansions and redevelopments, refinancing debt, and\nselling assets. Working with the third-party managers it engages, our advisor reviews and approves operating and capital budgets, inspects\nproperties, and provides input on business strategy at the property.\nOur advisor monitors compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of any of our\nreal estate investments on an ongoing basis, which typically involves ensuring that each tenant has paid real estate taxes and other expenses\nrelating to the properties it occupies and is maintaining appropriate insurance coverage. To ensure such compliance at our properties, our advisor\nalso utilizes third-party asset managers for certain domestic and international investments. Our advisor also reviews financial statements of our\ntenants and undertakes physical inspections of the condition and maintenance. Additionally, our advisor periodically analyzes each tenant\u2019s\nfinancial condition, the industry in which each tenant operates, and each tenant\u2019s relative strength in its industry. We believe our advisor\u2019s in-\ndepth understanding of our tenants\u2019 businesses and direct relationships with their management teams provides strong visibility into potential\nissues. Our advisor\u2019s business intelligence platform provides real-time information, allowing asset managers to work with tenants to enforce lease\nprovisions, and where appropriate, consider lease modifications.\nHolding Period\nWe generally intend to hold our investments in real property for an extended period depending on the type of investment. The determination of\nwhether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made\n60\nTable of Contents\nafter consideration of relevant factors (including prevailing economic conditions), with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation for our\nstockholders or avoiding increases in risk. No assurance can be given that these objectives will be realized.\nOne of our objectives is ultimately to provide our stockholders with the opportunity to obtain liquidity for their investments in us. We may provide\nliquidity for our stockholders through sales of assets (either on a portfolio basis or individually), a listing of our shares on a stock exchange, a\nmerger (which may include a merger with W. P. Carey or its affiliates) an enhanced redemption program or another transaction approved by our\nboard of directors. We are under no obligation to liquidate our portfolio within any particular period since the precise timing will depend on real\nestate and financial markets, economic conditions of the areas in which the properties are located, and tax effects on stockholders that may prevail\nin the future. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate a liquidity event. In the most recent instance in which\nstockholders of a non-traded REIT managed by our advisor were provided with liquidity, Corporate Property Associates 17 - Global Incorporated\nmerged with and into a subsidiary of W. P. Carey on October 31, 2018.\nOn August 31, 2021, we reported that our independent directors intended to begin the process of evaluating possible liquidity alternatives for our\nstockholders, which included an unsolicited preliminary proposal for a potential business combination transaction received from affiliates of our\nadvisor. The independent directors have formed a special committee and retained advisors. There can be no assurance as to the form or timing of\nany liquidity alternative or that any alternative may be pursued at all for the foreseeable future. We do not intend to discuss the evaluation process\nunless and until a particular alternative is selected.\nFinancing Strategies\nConsistent with our investment policies, we use leverage when available on terms we believe are favorable. We will generally borrow in the same\ncurrency that is used to pay rent on the property. This enables us to hedge a significant portion of our currency risk on international investments.\nWe, through the subsidiaries we form to make investments, will generally seek to borrow on a non-recourse basis and in amounts that we believe\nwill maximize the return to our stockholders, although we may also borrow at the corporate level. The use of non-recourse financing may allow us to\nimprove returns to our stockholders and to limit our exposure on any investment to the amount invested.\nAggregate borrowings on our portfolio as a whole may not exceed, on average, the lesser of 75% of the total costs of all investments or 300% of\nour net assets, unless the excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report,\nalong with justification for the excess.\nOur charter currently provides that we will not borrow funds from our directors, W. P. Carey, our advisor or any of their respective affiliates unless\nthe transaction is approved by a majority of our directors (including a majority of the independent directors) who do not have an interest in the\ntransaction, as being fair, competitive, and commercially reasonable and not less favorable than those prevailing for loans between unaffiliated third\nparties under the same circumstances. We have a $50.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit agreement with W. P. Carey, which was approved\nby our directors. Under this line of credit, we may borrow at a rate equal to the rate that W. P. Carey can borrow funds under its senior credit facility,\nwith a scheduled maturity date of March 31, 2023.\nInvestment Strategies\nLong-Term, Net-Leased Assets\nIn analyzing potential net-lease investments for our real estate portfolio, our advisor reviews various aspects of a transaction, including the tenant\nand the underlying real estate fundamentals, to determine whether the potential investment and lease structure will satisfy our investment criteria.\nIn evaluating net-leased transactions, our advisor generally considers, among other things, the following aspects of each transaction:\nTenant/Borrower Evaluation - Our advisor evaluates each potential tenant or borrower for its creditworthiness, typically considering factors such\nas management experience, industry position and fundamentals,\n61\nTable of Contents\noperating history, and capital structure. Our advisor also rates each asset based on its market, liquidity, and criticality to the tenant\u2019s operations, as\nwell as other factors that may be unique to a particular investment. Our advisor seeks opportunities in which it believes the tenant may have a\nstable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been fully recognized by the market. Our advisor defines creditworthiness as a risk-\nreward relationship appropriate to its investment strategies, which may or may not coincide with ratings issued by the credit rating agencies. Our\nadvisor has a robust internal credit rating system and may designate subsidiaries of non-guarantor parent companies with investment grade ratings\nas \u201cimplied investment grade.\u201d As of December 31, 2021, we had eight and five tenants that were rated investment grade and implied investment\ngrade, respectively, as well as 37 below-investment grade tenants (with a weighted-average internal credit rating of 3.7). The aforementioned credit\nrating data does not include our student housing operating properties and development projects.\nLease Terms - Generally, the net-leased properties we invest in are leased on a full-recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, the\nvast majority of our leases provide for scheduled rent increases over the term of the lease. These increases are either fixed (i.e., mandated on\nspecific dates) or tied to increases in inflation indices (e.g., Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d), or similar indices in the jurisdiction where the property is\nlocated), but may contain caps or other limitations, either on an annual or overall basis. In the case of retail stores, hotels, and net leased student\nhousing properties (when the student housing property is completed and occupied subsequent to the beginning of an academic school year) the\nlease may initially provide for participation in gross revenues of the tenant above a stated level (\u201cpercentage rent\u201d) as opposed to a fixed rent.\nTransaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value - When negotiating leases with potential tenants, our Advisor attempts to include\nprovisions it believes may help to protect our investment from changes in the tenant\u2019s operating and financial characteristics, which may affect the\ntenant\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations to us or reduce the value of our investment. Such provisions include covenants requiring our consent for\ncertain activities, requiring indemnification protections and/or security deposits, and requiring the tenant to satisfy specific operating tests. We\nmay also seek to enhance the likelihood that a tenant will satisfy their lease obligations through a letter of credit or guaranty from the tenant\u2019s\nparent or other entity. Such credit enhancements, if obtained, provide us with additional financial security. However, in markets where competition\nfor net-lease transactions is strong, some or all of these lease provisions may be difficult to obtain.\nCompetition - We face active competition from many sources, both domestically and internationally, for net-lease investment opportunities in\ncommercial properties. In general, we believe that our advisor\u2019s experience in real estate, credit underwriting, and transaction structuring will allow\nus to compete effectively for commercial properties. However, competitors may be willing to accept rates of return, lease terms, other transaction\nterms, or levels of risk that we find unacceptable.\nOperating Properties and Other\nSelf-Storage Investments - Our advisor combines a rigorous underwriting process and active oversight of property managers with a goal to\ngenerate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our self-storage investments are managed by unaffiliated third parties who have been engaged by our\nadvisor. Our advisor\u2019s internal asset management personnel oversee the third-party managers with detailed performance reviews, budget review\nand approval, and business strategy review.\nStudent Housing Investments - We have strategic relationships with third parties for the purpose of sourcing and managing investment\nopportunities in this sector, both domestically and internationally. We combine a rigorous underwriting process and active oversight of property\ndevelopers and managers with a goal to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nDiversification\nOur advisor attempts to diversify our portfolio to avoid undue dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, geographic\nlocation, or industry. By diversifying the portfolio, our advisor seeks to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a\ndownturn in any particular industry or geographic region. While our advisor has no fixed diversity metrics in our portfolio, we believe that it is well-\ndiversified. Our Advisor also assesses the relative risk of our portfolio on a quarterly basis.\n62\nTable of Contents\nReal Estate Evaluation - Our advisor reviews and evaluates the physical condition of the property and the market in which it is located. Our\nadvisor considers a variety of factors, including current market rents, replacement cost, residual valuation, property operating history, demographic\ncharacteristics of the location and accessibility, competitive properties, and suitability for re-leasing. Our advisor obtains third-party environmental\nand engineering reports and market studies for us when required. When considering an investment outside the United States, our advisor will also\nconsider factors particular to a country or region, including geopolitical risk, in addition to the risks normally associated with real property\ninvestments.\nFinancial Information about Geographic Areas\nSee \"The Combined Company\" below for financial information pertaining to our geographic operations.\nProperties\nOur principal corporate offices are located at One Manhattan West, 395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor, New York, NY 10001.

In order to retain liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, our\ndistributions declared for both Class A and Class C common stock since the second quarter of 2020 were reduced from previous levels.\n(a)\n63\nTable of Contents\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2021, we issued 342,766 shares of our Class A common stock to our Advisor as consideration for\nasset management fees, which were issued at our most recently published NAV at the date of issuance. The shares issued in October and\nNovember 2021 (231,986 shares) were based on the NAV as of June 30, 2021 ($8.91), and the shares issued in December 2021 (110,780 shares) were\nbased on the NAV as of September 30, 2021 ($9.07). In acquiring our shares, our advisor represented that such interests were being acquired by it\nfor investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof. As previously discussed in our filings with the SEC, over the past three\nyears, we have issued 27,792 shares of our common stock to our directors from time to time. Since none of these transactions were considered to\nhave involved a \u201cpublic offering\u201d within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, the shares issued were deemed to be exempt\nfrom registration.\nAll other prior sales of unregistered securities have been reported in our previously filed quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K,\nrespectively.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our redemption plan during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2021:\nClass A\nClass C\nTotal number of\nshares purchased\nas part of publicly\nannounced plans\nor program\nMaximum number\n(or approximate\ndollar value) of\nshares that may\nyet be purchased\nunder the plans or\nprogram\n2021 Period\nTotal number of\nClass A shares\npurchased \nAverage price paid\nper share\nTotal number of\nClass C shares\npurchased \nAverage price paid\nper share\nOctober 1-31\n-\n-\n-\nN/A\nN/A\nNovember 1-30\n-\n-\nN/A\nN/A\nDecember 1-31\n2,124,952 $\n8.69\n1,048,508 $\n8.63\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal\n2,124,952\n1,048,508\n__________________\n(a)Represents shares of our Class A and Class C common stock requested to be repurchased under our redemption plan, pursuant to which we may elect to redeem shares at\nthe request of our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions, conditions, and limitations. The maximum amount of shares purchasable by us in any period depends on a\nnumber of factors and is at the discretion of our board of directors. On August 31, 2020, our board of directors approved, effective as of that date, limiting the amount of\ncash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP (as further detailed in the Form\n8-K filed with the SEC on September 1, 2020). During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we received 90 and 26 redemption requests for Class A and Class C\ncommon stock, respectively, which were all fulfilled as of the date of this Report. We also redeemed 1,746,379 and 976,102 shares of Class A and Class C common stock\nthat had previously been unfulfilled. We generally receive fees in connection with share redemptions. The average price paid per share will vary depending on the number\nof redemption requests that were made during the period, the number of redemption requests that qualify for special circumstances, and the most recently published\nquarterly NAV. For shares redeemed under such special circumstances, the redemption price was the greater of the price paid to acquire the shares from us or 95% of our\nmost recently published quarterly NAVs.\nSecurities Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management\n\"Beneficial Ownership\" as used herein has been determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and is not to be construed as a\nrepresentation that any of such shares are in fact beneficially owned by any person.

Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of their affiliates owning shares of CPA:18\nCommon Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between CPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor\u037e and (ii) for the purpose\nof determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's\ndirectors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the matter and will not be included in making such determination. Accordingly,\nshares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations also provides the reader with our perspective\non our financial position and liquidity, as well as certain other factors that may affect our future results.\nWe operate in three reportable business segments: Net Lease, Self Storage, and Other Operating Properties. Our Net Lease segment includes our\nWe operate in three reportable business segments: Net Lease, Self Storage, and Other Operating Properties. Our Net Lease segment includes our\ninvestments in net-leased properties, whether they are accounted for as operating leases or direct financing leases. Our Self Storage segment is\ncomprised of our investments in self-storage properties. Our Other Operating Properties segment is primarily comprised of our investments in\nstudent housing operating properties, and multi-family residential properties (our last multi-family residential property was sold in January 2019). In\naddition, we have an All Other category that includes our notes receivable investments, one of which was repaid during the second quarter of 2019.\nOur reportable business segments and All other category are the same as our reporting units.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes, certain of which are\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and the matters described under the Risk Factors section beginning on page 25.\nPlease see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for discussion of our results of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\nSignificant Developments\nCOVID-19\nOur advisor continues to actively engage in discussions with our tenants and the third-party managers of our operating properties regarding the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business operations, liquidity, and financial position. Through the date of this Report, we received from\ntenants approximately 96% of contractual base rent that was due in the fourth quarter of 2021 (based on contractual minimum ABR as of September\n30, 2021) and 96% of contractual rents due at our self-storage properties during the fourth quarter of 2021. Given the ongoing uncertainty\nsurrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict its effect on our tenants\u2019 continued ability to pay rent. Therefore,\ninformation provided in this Report regarding rent collections should not serve as an indication of expected future rent collections.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2021, our debt and interest obligations due within one year totaled $264.7 million, and we expect to fund capital commitments of\n$48.5 million in the next year, primarily for our three student housing development projects. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliquidity and capital resource requirements, primarily through available cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities, and\nundrawn capacity under our construction loans. If necessary, we are able to borrow up to $50.0 million under an unsecured revolving line of credit\nwith W. P. Carey (scheduled to mature on March 31, 2023), which had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2021. Subsequent to December 31,\n2021 and through the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we borrowed $18.0 million under the line of credit. Additional sources of liquidity, if\nnecessary, includes leveraging our unleveraged properties (which had an aggregate carrying value of $79.9 million as of December 31, 2021),\nrefinancing existing debt obligations, and asset sales. To help us preserve cash, since April 1, 2020, our advisor has agreed to receive all asset\nmanagement fees in shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, in order to enable us to retain cash and preserve financial flexibility, (i) since\nthe second quarter of 2020, our quarterly distributions declared for both Class A and Class C common stock have generally been reduced from\nprevious levels and (ii) since August 2020, we have generally limited the amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount\nreinvested by stockholders in our DRIP.\nIn December 2021, we declared and paid an all-cash special distribution of $0.2000 per share for both Class A and Class C common stock, with\nproceeds from the disposition of certain assets. In December 2021, we also\n66\nTable of Contents\nfulfilled redemption requests for our Class A and Class C common stock totaling approximately $18.5 million and $9.0 million, respectively, including\nall requests that were previously unfulfilled.\nNet Asset Values\nOur advisor calculates our NAVs as of each quarter-end by relying in part on rolling update appraisals covering approximately 25% of our real\nestate portfolio each quarter, adjusted to give effect to the estimated fair value of our debt (all provided by an independent third party) and for other\nrelevant factors. Since our quarterly NAVs are not based on an appraisal of our full portfolio, to the extent any new quarterly NAV adjustments are\nwithin 1% of our previously disclosed NAVs, our quarterly NAVs will remain unchanged. We monitor properties not appraised during the quarter to\nidentify any that may have experienced a significant event and obtain updated third-party appraisals for such properties. Our NAVs are based on a\nnumber of variables, including individual tenant credits, lease terms, lending credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates, share counts, tenant\ndefaults, and development projects that are not yet generating income, among others. We do not control all of these variables and, as such, cannot\npredict how they will change in the future. Costs associated with our development projects (which are not yet generating income) are not appraised\nquarterly and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. These costs are included in Real estate under construction in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our NAVs as of September 30, 2021 were $9.07 for both our Class A and Class C common stock. Please see our Current Report\non Form 8-K dated December 9, 2021 for additional information regarding the calculation of our NAVs.\nFinancial Highlights\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the following (as further described in the consolidated financial statements).\nProjects Placed into Service\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed and placed into service four student housing properties totaling $171.2 million of\ncapitalized costs. Three of the properties are located in Spain and one is located in Portugal. All four of the properties are subject to net lease\nagreements with a third party (which includes fixed minimum rents), and are included in Real estate - Land, buildings and improvements in the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nDisposition Activity\nOn September 3, 2021, we sold two student housing operating properties located in Cardiff and Portsmouth, United Kingdom, for total proceeds,\nnet of selling costs, of $147.8 million (based on the exchange rate of the British pound sterling on the date of disposition), and recognized a net gain\non these sales totaling $42.8 million (inclusive of $3.7 million attributable to a noncontrolling interest). In connection with this disposition, we\nprepaid a non-recourse mortgage loan of $83.3 million, with an interest rate of 2.3%, encumbering the disposed properties.\nOn October 29, 2021, we sold a retail facility in Zadar, Croatia, for total proceeds, net of selling costs, of $14.4 million (based on the exchange rate of\nthe euro on the date of the disposition), and recognized a net gain on this sale of $2.0 million (inclusive of $0.4 million attributable to a\nnoncontrolling interest). In connection with this disposition, we prepaid a non-recourse mortgage loan of $8.3 million, with an interest rate of 3.9%,\nencumbering the property.\nOn December 29, 2021, we sold a vacant industrial facility located in Columbus, Georgia, for total proceeds, net of selling costs, of $0.5 million, and\nrecognized a net loss on this sale of $0.8 million. In connection with this disposition, we prepaid a non-recourse mortgage loan of $6.8 million, with\nan interest rate of 5.0%, encumbering the property.\nFinancing Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we obtained non-recourse mortgage loans and construction loans in connection with five student\nhousing properties totaling approximately $153.7 million, with drawdowns totaling\n67\nTable of Contents\napproximately $123.6 million during the year (amounts are based on the applicable exchange rates on the date of the transactions).\nMortgage Loan Repayments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid four non-recourse mortgage loans at maturity with an aggregate principal balance of\napproximately $56.3 million and a weighted-average interest rate of 4.2%.\nConsolidated Results\n(in thousands)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nTotal revenues\n$\n204,217 $\n177,067\nNet income attributable to CPA:18 - Global\n27,846\n12,343\nCash distributions paid\n68,360\n63,271\nDistributions declared:\nQuarterly recurring distributions \n37,773\n49,973\nSpecial distribution \n30,470\n-\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n92,390\n89,991\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n35,110\n(143,606)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(162,519)\n7,520\nSupplemental financial measures:\nFFO attributable to CPA:18 - Global \n61,145\n55,221\nMFFO attributable to CPA:18 - Global \n64,957\n58,191\nAdjusted MFFO attributable to CPA:18 - Global \n63,228\n57,236\n__________________\n(a)Quarterly distributions declared are generally paid in the subsequent quarter.

See Supplemental Financial Measures below for our definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations\nto their most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher revenues from self-storage operating properties (driven by an\nincrease in occupancy and unit rates) and the positive impact of our student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and 2021, as well as\nthe write-off of straight-line rent during 2020.\nNet Income Attributable to CPA:18 - Global\nNet income attributable to CPA:18 - Global increased during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to a higher gain on sale of real estate, higher\nrevenues from self-storage operating properties, the positive impact of the nine student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and\n2021, and the write-off of straight-line rent recorded during 2020, partially offset by an impairment charge recognized during 2021 and higher interest\nexpense (primarily due to the impact of mortgage financings obtained on certain student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and\n2021).\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(c)\n(c)\n68\nTable of Contents\nFFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO Attributable to CPA:18 - Global\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, FFO, MFFO, and adjusted MFFO increased primarily due to higher revenues from self-\nstorage operating properties and the positive impact of our student housing properties placed into service during 2020 and 2021, partially offset by\nhigher interest expense.\nPortfolio Overview\nWe hold a diversified portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate properties, and other real estate-related assets.

As of December 31, 2021, approximately 44.2% of our leases (based on ABR) provided for adjustments\nbased on formulas indexed to changes in the U.S. CPI (or similar indices for the jurisdiction in which the property is located), some of which are\nsubject to caps and/or floors. In addition, 42.3% of our leases (based on ABR) have fixed rent adjustments, for a scheduled average ABR increase\nof 1.8% over the next 12 months. Lease revenues from our international investments are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily from the\neuro. We recognize rents from percentage rents as reported by the lessees, which is after the level of sales requiring a rental payment to us is\nreached. Percentage rents are insignificant for the periods presented.\nIn September 2021, we restructured the leases with a tenant for two net lease hotel properties located in Germany, with ABR totaling approximately\n$6.0 million as of December 31, 2021. Certain rents due from 2020 through 2022 have been deferred, to be paid in equal installments of approximately\n$2.0 million annually (based on the exchange rate of the euro as of December 31, 2021) from 2023 through 2027, in addition to base rent due.\nDeferred rent will be recognized as collected in the period received. Rents due from 2020 through 2021 totaling approximately $5.4 million (based on\nthe exchange rate of the euro as of December 31, 2021) were waived in connection with this restructuring. However, such rents were not previously\nrecognized, therefore there is no impact on our results of operations as a result of waiving rents.\n(a)\n73\nTable of Contents\nOperating Properties\nAs of December 31, 2021, our operating portfolio consisted of 65 self-storage properties and one student housing operating property.

We have a number\nof investments in which our economic ownership is less than 100%. On a full consolidation basis, we report 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues,\nand expenses of those investments that are deemed to be under our control or for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, even if our\nownership is less than 100%. Also, for all other jointly owned investments, which we do not control, we report our net investment and our net\nincome (loss) from that investment. On a pro rata basis, we generally present our proportionate share, based on our economic ownership of these\njointly owned investments, of the portfolio metrics of those investments. Multiplying each of our jointly owned investments\u2019 financial statement\nline items by our percentage ownership and adding or subtracting those amounts from our totals, as applicable, may not accurately depict the legal\nand economic implications of holding an ownership interest of less than 100% in our jointly owned investments.\nABR - ABR represents contractual minimum annualized base rent for our net-leased properties and reflects exchange rates as of December 31, 2021.\nIf there is a rent abatement, we annualize the first monthly contractual base rent following the free rent period. ABR is not applicable to operating\nproperties.\nNOI - Net operating income (\u201cNOI\u201d) is a non-GAAP measure intended to reflect the performance of our entire portfolio of properties and\ninvestments. We define NOI as lease revenues and other operating interest income less non-reimbursable property and corporate expenses as\ndetermined by GAAP. We believe that NOI is a helpful measure that both investors and management can use to evaluate the financial performance\nof our properties and it allows for comparison of our portfolio performance between periods and to other REITs. While we believe that NOI is a\nuseful supplemental measure, it should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indication of our operating performance.\nStabilized NOI - We use Stabilized NOI, a non-GAAP measure, as a metric to evaluate the performance of our entire portfolio of properties.\nStabilized NOI for development projects and newly acquired operating properties that are not yet substantially leased up are not included in our\nportfolio information until one year after the project has been substantially completed and placed into service, or the property has been\nsubstantially leased up (and the project or property has not been disposed of during or prior to the current period). In addition, any newly acquired\nstabilized operating property is included in our portfolio of Stabilized NOI information upon acquisition. Stabilized NOI for a net-leased property is\nincluded in our portfolio information upon acquisition or in the period when it is placed into service (as the property will already have a lease in\nplace).\nStabilized NOI is adjusted for corporate expenses, such as asset management fees and the available cash generated by the Operating Partnership\n(the \"Available Cash Distribution\u201d) to our advisor, that are calculated and reported at the corporate level and not evaluated as part of any\nproperty\u2019s operating performance. Additionally, non-cash adjustments (such as straight-line rent adjustments) and interest income related to our\nnotes receivable (which is non-property related) are not included in Stabilized NOI. Lastly, non-core income is excluded from Stabilized NOI as this\nincome is generally not recurring in nature.\nWe believe that Stabilized NOI is a helpful measure that both investors and management can use to evaluate the financial performance of our\nproperties and it allows for comparison of our portfolio performance between periods and to other REITs. While we believe that Stabilized NOI is a\nuseful supplemental measure, it should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance.\n75\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Net Operating Income Attributable to CPA:18 - Global (non-GAAP) (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nNet Income (GAAP)\n$\n27,610 $\n22,301\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization\n68,179\n63,809\nImpairment charges\n23,504\n-\nAllowance for credit losses\n-\n(2,874)\nInterest expense\n50,959\n43,343\nEarnings from equity method investment in real estate\n-\n(12,313)\nGain on sale of real estate, net\n(44,015)\n(2,390)\nOther (gains) and losses\n2,728\n(1,904)\nProvision for income taxes\n1,850\n769\nNOI related to noncontrolling interests \n(12,616)\n(12,111)\nNOI related to equity method investment in real estate \n-\n1,714\nNet Operating Income Attributable to CPA:18 - Global (Non-GAAP)\n$\n118,199 $\n100,344\n(1) NOI related to noncontrolling interests:\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests (GAAP)\n$\n236 $\n(9,958)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(6,736)\n(6,327)\nImpairment charges\n(11,752)\n-\nInterest expense\n(4,858)\n(4,554)\nGain on sale of real estate, net\n4,132\n-\nOther gains and (losses)\n(455)\n1,438\n(Provision for) benefit from income taxes\n(528)\n65\nAvailable Cash Distributions to a related party\n7,345\n7,225\nNOI related to noncontrolling interests\n$\n(12,616) $\n(12,111)\n(2) NOI related to equity method investment in real estate:\nEarnings from equity method investment in real estate (GAAP)\n$\n- $\n12,313\nDepreciation and amortization\n-\n754\nInterest expense\n-\n1,603\nGain on sale of real estate, net\n-\n(12,870)\nOther gains and (losses)\n-\n(108)\nBenefit from income taxes\n-\n22\nNOI related to equity method investment in real estate\n$\n- $\n1,714\n(1)\n(2)\n76\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Stabilized NOI to Net Operating Income Attributable to CPA:18 - Global (Non-GAAP) (pro rata, in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nNet-leased\n$\n83,146 $\n76,570\nSelf storage\n46,419\n36,816\nOther operating properties\n1,536\n4,879\nStabilized NOI\n131,101\n118,265\nOther NOI:\nCorporate \n(21,104)\n(19,311)\nDisposed properties\n3,082\n1,483\nStraight-line rent adjustments \n3,052\n(4,249)\nNon-core income \n270\n2,043\nNotes receivable\n(15)\n1,380\n116,386\n99,611\nRecently-opened operating property \n-\n765\nBuild-to-suit and development projects \n1,813\n(32)\nNet Operating Income Attributable to CPA:18 - Global (Non-GAAP)\n$\n118,199 $\n100,344\n__________________\n(a)Includes expenses such as asset management fees, the Available Cash Distribution to our advisor, and other costs that are calculated and reported at the corporate level\nand not evaluated as part of any property\u2019s operating performance.\n(b)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $7.0 million write-off of straight-line rent receivables.\n(c)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes NOI related to lease-related settlements collected from tenants that were previously reserved in prior periods, as well as\ntermination income received.\n(d)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes the student housing operating property located in Austin, Texas, which was placed into service during the third quarter of\n2020.\n(e)Both years include NOI for our ongoing student housing development projects.\nResults of Operations\nWe evaluate our results of operations with a focus on: (i) our ability to generate the cash flow necessary to meet our objectives of funding\ndistributions to stockholders and (ii) increasing the value of our real estate investments.

The fair value measurement was determined by estimating discounted cash\nflows using three significant unobservable inputs, which were the discount rate (7.00%), residual capitalization rate (range of 6.75% to 7.75%), and\nestimated market rents (range of $17 to $18 per square foot). This impairment charge is included within Impairment charges and Net loss (income)\nattributable to noncontrolling interests on our consolidated statements of income, and reduced Real estate - Land, buildings and improvements and\nNoncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net reversal of our allowance for credit losses of $2.9 million due to changes in expected\neconomic conditions relating to a net investment in direct financing lease.\n79\nTable of Contents\nOther Income and (Expenses), and Provision for Income Taxes\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense is directly impacted by the non-recourse secured debt financings obtained, assumed, or extinguished in connection with our\ninvestment, construction, and disposition activity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, interest expense increased by $7.6 million, primarily as a result of the mortgage\nfinancings obtained on certain student housing properties placed into service during 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table presents certain information about our outstanding debt (dollars in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nAverage outstanding debt balance\n$\n1,306,841\n$\n1,195,990\nWeighted-average interest rate\n3.7%\n3.9%\nGain on Sale of Real Estate, Net\nGain on sale of real estate, net, consists of gain on the sale of properties that were disposed of during the reporting period. Our dispositions are\nmore fully described in our notes to our audited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated\nstatements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021.\nOther Gains and (Losses)\nOther gains and (losses) primarily consist of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and derivative instruments. We make intercompany\nloans to a number of our foreign subsidiaries, most of which do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Remeasurement of foreign\ncurrency intercompany transactions that are scheduled for settlement, consisting primarily of accrued interest and amortizing loans, are included in\nthe determination of net income. We also recognize gains or losses on foreign currency transactions held by entities with the U.S. dollar as their\nfunctional currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The timing and amount of such gains or losses cannot always be estimated and\nare subject to fluctuation.\n2021 - For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net other losses of $2.7 million, which was primarily comprised of (i) net realized and\nunrealized losses of $2.3 million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates\u037e and (ii) a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million\u037e\n(iii) a gain of $0.8 million relating to a rental guarantee settlement received\u037e and (iii) a gain of $0.4 million relating to proceeds received from a prior\ndisposition.\n2020 - For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net other gains of $1.9 million, which was primarily comprised of (i) $3.9 million of\nrealized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains\u037e (ii) $1.3 million of net realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts and collars\u037e\nand (iii) $0.3 million of interest income from our cash accounts, offset by $3.5 million of losses incurred in relation to our previously owned Ghana\ninvestment.\nEarnings (Losses) from Equity Method Investment in Real Estate\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, earnings from our equity method investment in real estate totaled $12.3 million, primarily due to the sale of\nthree self-storage facilities located in Canada for total proceeds of $62.3 million, for which we recognized a gain on sale of $12.9 million (inclusive of\ntax of $1.8 million).\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is primarily related to our international properties.\n80\nTable of Contents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, our net provision for income taxes increased by $1.1 million, primarily due to higher\ncurrent tax expense related to reviews of tax positions on certain international properties.\nNet Loss (Income) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $0.2 million, compared to net income\nattributable to noncontrolling interests of $10.0 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a noncontrolling\ninterest\u2019s $11.8 million share of an impairment charge recognized on one of our properties during 2021, partially offset by $3.7 million related to the\nnet gain on sale of the two student housing operating properties disposed in 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash During the Year\nWe use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, fund construction projects, service debt, and fund\ndistributions to stockholders. Our cash flows will fluctuate periodically due to a number of factors, which may include, among other things: the\ntiming of funding for our build-to-suit and development projects\u037e the timing of the receipt of proceeds from, and the repayment of, non-recourse\nsecured debt and the W. P. Carey line of credit, and the receipt of lease revenues\u037e whether our Advisor receives fees in shares of our common stock\nor cash, which our board of directors elects after consultation with our advisor\u037e the timing of payments of the Available Cash Distributions to our\nadvisor\u037e and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Despite these fluctuations, we believe our investments will generate sufficient cash from\noperations to meet our normal recurring short-term and long-term liquidity needs, as well as the measures noted above. We may also use existing\ncash resources, the proceeds of non-recourse secured debt, sales of assets, and distributions reinvested in our common stock through our DRIP\n(as noted below, our board of directors has limited the amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested in our DRIP)\nto meet these needs. We assess our ability to access capital on an ongoing basis. Our sources and uses of cash during the period are described\nbelow.\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.4 million during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher\nrevenues from self-storage operating properties, driven by an increase in occupancy and unit rates, partially offset by higher interest expense.\nInvesting Activities - Our investing activities are generally comprised of funding of development projects and capitalized property-related costs. In\naddition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold (i) two student housing operating properties located in the United Kingdom for net\nproceeds of $147.8 million\u037e (ii) a retail facility in Zadar, Croatia, for net proceeds of $14.4 million\u037e and (iii) a vacant industrial facility located in\nColumbus, Georgia, for net proceeds of $0.5 million. We also acquired one net-leased property for $10.9 million during the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nFinancing Activities - Our financing activities are generally comprised of borrowings, repayments and prepayments of our non-recourse secured\ndebt and line of credit with W. P. Carey, and activity relating to our common stock, which includes (i) payments of distributions to stockholders, (ii)\ndistributions that are reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock through our DRIP, and (iii) repurchases of shares of our common\nstock pursuant to our redemption program as described below. In addition, cash paid and received in accordance with our individual agreements\nwith our joint-venture partners are considered financing cash flow activities.\nDistributions\nOur objectives are to generate sufficient cash flow over time to provide stockholders with distributions. During 2021, we declared distributions to\nstockholders of $68.2 million, which were comprised of cash distributions of $50.8 million (including an all-cash special distribution) and $17.4\nmillion reinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have\ndeclared distributions to stockholders totaling $598.9 million, which were comprised of cash distributions of $310.4 million and $288.5 million\nreinvested by stockholders in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP.\n81\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that FFO, a non-GAAP measure, is an appropriate metric to evaluate our ability to fund distributions to stockholders. For a discussion\nof FFO, see Supplemental Financial Measures below. Since inception, the regular quarterly cash distributions that we pay have principally been\ncovered by FFO or cash flow from operations. However, we funded a portion of our cash distributions to date using net proceeds from our initial\npublic offering and there can be no assurance that our FFO or cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our future distributions. Our\ndistribution coverage using both FFO as well as our net cash provided by operating activities fully covered our total quarterly recurring\ndistributions declared for the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2021, we declared and paid an all-cash special distribution of $0.2000 per\nshare for both Class A and Class C stock with proceeds from the disposition of certain assets.\nRedemptions\nWe maintain a quarterly redemption program pursuant to which we may, at the discretion of our board of directors, redeem shares of our common\nstock from stockholders seeking liquidity. On August 31, 2020, our board of directors approved, effective as of that date, generally limiting the\namount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested by stockholders in our DRIP (as further detailed in the Form 8-K filed\nwith the SEC on September 1, 2020). We prioritized qualifying special circumstance redemption requests (i.e., death, disability, receipt of long-term\ncare), with shares pursuant to the remaining requests redeemed on a pro rata basis. In December 2021, we redeemed in full any shares covered by\nunfulfilled redemption requests. Our board of directors retains the discretion to modify the program at any time.\nThe following table illustrates our redemption activity in both shares of our common stock and dollars during the year ended December 31, 2021\n(dollars in thousands):\nClass A\nClass C\nTotal\nShares\nDollars \nShares\nDollars \nShares\nDollars \nRedemptions unfulfilled beginnings\nbalance \n995,407 $\n8,085\n716,392 $\n5,819\n1,711,799 $\n13,904\nRedemptions requested \n2,283,062\n19,932\n1,291,060\n11,283\n3,574,122\n31,215\nRedemptions processed \n(3,278,469)\n(28,621)\n(2,007,452)\n(17,494)\n(5,285,921)\n(46,115)\nRedemptions unfulfilled ending\nbalance\n- $\n-\n- $\n-\n- $\n-\n__________________\n(a)Except for redemptions sought in certain defined special circumstances, the redemption price of the shares listed above was 95% of our most recently published\nquarterly NAVs at the time the redemption request was made or processed.

Of this amount, $31.2 million (at then-current exchange rates) was held in foreign subsidiaries,\nwhich may be subject to restrictions or significant costs should we decide to repatriate these funds\u037e\n\u2022ability to borrow up to $50.0 million from the unsecured revolving line of credit with W. P. Carey (scheduled to mature on March 31, 2023), which\nhad no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2021 and through the date of this Report, we borrowed $18.0\nmillion under the line of credit\u037e\n\u2022ability to borrow up to $32.0 million and $1.3 million under our third-party and external joint-venture financing arrangements, respectively\u037e and\n\u2022unleveraged properties that had an aggregate carrying value of $79.9 million as of December 31, 2021, although there can be no assurance that we\nwould be able to obtain financing for these properties on acceptable terms.\nOur cash resources may be used for funding construction costs, working capital needs, other commitments, and to make distributions to our\nstockholders.\n(a)\n(b)\n83\nTable of Contents\nCash Requirements and Liquidity\nDuring the next 12 months following December 31, 2021 and thereafter, we expect that our significant cash requirements will include:\n\u2022paying distributions to our stockholders and to our affiliates that hold noncontrolling interests in entities we control\u037e\n\u2022funding future capital commitments such as development projects\u037e\n\u2022making scheduled principal and balloon payments on our debt obligations\u037e\n\u2022making scheduled interest payments on our debt obligations (future interest payments total $120.9 million, with $44.4 million due during the next 12\nmonths\u037e interest on unhedged variable-rate debt obligations was calculated using the applicable annual variable interest rates)\u037e and\n\u2022making share repurchases pursuant to our redemption plan.\nWe use the cash flow generated from our investments primarily to meet our operating expenses, service debt, and fund distributions to\nstockholders. We may also use proceeds from asset sales to fund development projects, build-to-suit investments, and short-term cash\nrequirements. We currently expect that, for the short-term, the aforementioned cash requirements will be funded through our cash resources (as\nnoted above), and our cash flow from operations, including the cash received under net lease and operating lease agreements. During 2020 and\n2021, we placed into service nine student housing properties (eight of which executed net lease agreements). In addition, in order to preserve cash\nand maintain financial flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\u2022at our option our advisor has received all asset management fees in shares of our Class A common stock since April 1, 2020\u037e\n\u2022we have reduced our distributions declared for both Class A and Class C common stock since the second quarter of 2020\u037e\n\u2022we limited the amount of cash available for our redemption program to the amount reinvested by stockholders in our DRIP, since August 2020\u037e and\n\u2022we have refinanced certain loans and have the ability to refinance loans coming due.\nOur liquidity could be adversely affected by unanticipated costs, greater-than-anticipated operating expenses, and the continuing adverse impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, such as tenants not paying rental obligations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our liquidity and\ndebt covenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nCertain amounts disclosed above are based on the exchange rate of the local currencies as of December 31, 2021, which consisted primarily of the\neuro and Norwegian krone and, to a lesser extent, the British pound sterling.\nEnvironmental Obligations\nIn connection with the purchase of many of our properties, we required the sellers to perform environmental reviews. We believe, based on the\nresults of these reviews, that our properties were in substantial compliance with federal, state, and foreign environmental statutes at the time the\nproperties were acquired. However, portions of certain properties have been subject to some degree of contamination, principally in connection\nwith leakage from underground storage tanks, surface spills, or other on-site activities. In most instances where contamination has been identified,\ntenants are actively engaged in the remediation process and addressing identified conditions. We believe that the ultimate resolution of any\nenvironmental matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. We record\nenvironmental obligations within Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.\n84\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nMany of our significant accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical\nexperience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are subject to change in the future if\nunderlying assumptions or factors change. Certain accounting policies, while significant, may not require the use of estimates. Those accounting\npolicies that require significant estimation and/or judgment are described under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our notes to our\naudited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive\nincome, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021.\nSupplemental Financial Measures\nIn the real estate industry, analysts and investors employ certain non-GAAP supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful\ncomparisons between periods and among peer companies. Additionally, in the formulation of our goals and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour strategies, we use FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are useful to investors to\nconsider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies.\nA description of FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasures are provided below.\nFFO\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment\nTrusts, Inc. (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate\nsupplemental measure, when used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, to reflect the operating\nperformance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental non-GAAP measure. FFO is not equivalent to, nor\na substitute for, net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors\nof NAREIT, as restated in December 2018. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains\nor losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate, and depreciation and amortization from real estate assets\u037e and after adjustments\nfor unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments are\ncalculated to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT\u2019s policy described above. However, NAREIT\u2019s definition of FFO does not\ndistinguish between the conventional method of equity accounting and the hypothetical liquidation at book value method of accounting for\nunconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements. We believe that,\nsince real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment, and\nconsumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical\naccounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be\nconstrued to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe\nthat the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization, as well as impairment charges of real estate-\nrelated assets, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management\u037e and when compared year over year,\nreflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest\ncosts, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is\na fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions, which can change over\ntime.\n85\nTable of Contents\nMFFO\nPublicly registered, non-traded REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their\ninitial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years,\nwe believe that non-traded REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after\nacquisition activity ceases. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-traded REITs, the Institute for Portfolio\nAlternatives (the \u201cIPA\u201d), an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental\nmeasure for publicly registered non-traded REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate non-GAAP measure to reflect our operations.\nMFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating\nperformance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy (as currently intended). Since MFFO excludes\ncosts that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO, we believe that it provides an\nindication of the sustainability of our operating performance after our initial property-acquisition phase. We believe that MFFO allows investors\nand analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance now that our initial public offering is complete and the proceeds are\ninvested. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-traded REIT industry.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA\u2019s Practice Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly\nRegistered, Non-Traded REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the \u201cPractice Guideline\u201d), issued in November 2010. The Practice Guideline\ndefines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, included in the determination of GAAP net income, as applicable: acquisition fees\nand expenses\u037e amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of above- and below-market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order\nto reflect such payments from a GAAP basis to a cash accrual basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments)\u037e accretion of discounts and\namortization of premiums on debt investments\u037e nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments (i.e., infrequent or unusual, not\nreasonably likely to recur in the ordinary course of business)\u037e mark-to-market adjustments included in net income\u037e nonrecurring gains or losses\nincluded in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, foreign exchange, derivatives, or securities holdings where trading of such holdings\nis not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned\ninvestments, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on\ndebt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from\nconsolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments, are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by\noperating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses that are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA\u2019s Practice Guideline described above and is adjusted for certain items, such as accretion of discounts\nand amortizations of premiums on borrowings (as such adjustments are comparable to the permitted adjustments for debt investments), allowance\nfor credit losses, non-cash accretion of environmental liabilities and amortization of ROU assets, which management believes is helpful in assessing\nour operating performance.\nOur management uses MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other non-traded REITs, which also have limited lives with defined\nacquisition periods and targeted exit strategies. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating\nperformance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. For example, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current\nmarket fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and\noccupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect\nanticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.\n86\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted MFFO\nIn addition, our management uses Adjusted MFFO as another measure of sustainable operating performance. Adjusted MFFO adjusts MFFO for\ndeferred income tax expenses and benefits, which are non-cash items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income, but have no impact on\ncurrent period cash flows. Additionally, we adjust MFFO to reflect the realized gains/losses on the settlement of foreign currency derivatives to\narrive at Adjusted MFFO. Foreign currency derivatives are a fundamental part of our operations in that they help us manage the foreign currency\nexposure we have associated with cash flows from our international investments.\nFFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different\nREITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs\nmay not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and\nshould not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an\nindication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nFFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate\nFFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments\nacross the non-traded REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO, MFFO, or Adjusted MFFO\naccordingly.\n87\nTable of Contents\nFFO, MFFO, and Adjusted MFFO were as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nNet income attributable to CPA:18 - Global\n$\n27,846 $\n12,343\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization of real property\n68,179\n63,809\nGain on sale of real estate, net\n(44,015)\n(2,390)\nImpairment charges\n23,504\n-\nProportionate share of adjustments for noncontrolling interests \n(14,369)\n(6,327)\nProportionate share of adjustments to earnings from equity method investment \n-\n(12,214)\nTotal adjustments\n33,299\n42,878\nFFO (as defined by NAREIT) attributable to CPA:18 - Global\n61,145\n55,221\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of premiums and discounts\n3,697\n1,709\nOther (gains) and losses \n2,894\n(1,536)\nStraight-line and other rent adjustments \n(2,255)\n4,452\nAbove- and below-market rent intangible lease amortization, net \n(726)\n(190)\nOther amortization and non-cash items\n698\n512\nAcquisition and other expenses\n285\n49\nAllowance for credit losses \n-\n(2,874)\nProportionate share of adjustments for noncontrolling interests \n(781)\n956\nProportionate share of adjustments to losses from equity method investment\n-\n(108)\nTotal adjustments\n3,812\n2,970\nMFFO attributable to CPA:18 - Global\n64,957\n58,191\nAdjustments:\nTax expense, deferred\n(2,049)\n(2,298)\nHedging gains\n320\n1,343\nTotal adjustments\n(1,729)\n(955)\nAdjusted MFFO attributable to CPA:18 - Global\n$\n63,228 $\n57,236\n__________________\n(a)Amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a noncontrolling interest\u2019s $11.8 million share of an impairment charge.\n(b)Amount for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a gain on sale of $12.9 million (inclusive of tax of $1.8 million) from the disposition of our equity method\ninvestment in real estate.\n(c)Primarily comprised of gains and losses on (i) foreign currency movements, (ii) derivatives, and (iii) extinguishment of debt.\n(d)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $2.8 million loss to write-off the value added tax receivable related to our previously owned Ghana investment, as\ncollectibility was no longer deemed probable.\n(e)Amount for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $7.0 million write-off in straight-line rent receivables. Under GAAP, rental receipts are recorded on a\nstraight-line basis over the life of the lease. This may result in timing of income recognition that is significantly different than on an accrual basis.\n(f)Under GAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for impairment, and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in\nvalue over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO. However, because real estate values\nand market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, management believes that by excluding charges relating to amortization of these intangibles,\nMFFO, and Adjusted MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate.\n(g)During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net reversal of our allowance for credit losses due to changes in expected economic conditions.\n(h)The year ended December 31, 2020 includes losses related to the litigation settlement with the joint-venture partner on our previously owned Ghana investment.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) (d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n(h)\n88",

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nTHE CPA:18 SPECIAL MEETING\nDate, Time and Place\nThe CPA:18 Special Meeting will be held in virtual format at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/CPA18merger, on July 26, 2022, 5:00 p.m., Eastern\nTime.\nPurpose\nThe purposes of the CPA:18 Special Meeting are to:\n\u2022consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022consider and vote upon any adjournments of the CPA:18 Special Meeting, including, without limitation, a motion to adjourn the special meeting to\nanother time for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to approve the Merger proposal.\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors of CPA:18 - Global\nAt a meeting on February 27, 2022, the CPA:18 - Global board of directors (with the unanimous vote of the independent directors), after careful\nconsideration and based on the unanimous recommendation of the CPA:18 Special Committee, adopted resolutions declaring that the Merger is\nadvisable and in the best interests of CPA:18 - Global and the CPA:18 Stockholders, and that the Merger is fair and reasonable to CPA:18 - Global\nand on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated third parties, and directing that the Merger be submitted for\nconsideration at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. The CPA:18 - Global board of directors recommends a vote \"FOR\" approval of the Merger. Jason E.\nFox, a director of each of CPA:18 - Global and W. P. Carey, abstained from voting on the matters.\nRecord Date, Outstanding Shares and Voting Rights\nCPA:18 - Global's board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 27, 2022 as the record date for the CPA:18 Special Meeting (the\n\"CPA:18 Record Date\"). Accordingly, only holders of record of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date are entitled to notice\nof, and to vote at, the CPA:18 Special Meeting. As of the CPA:18 Record Date, there were 149,688,862 outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock\nheld by approximately 26,930 holders of record. At the CPA:18 Special Meeting, each outstanding share of CPA:18 Common Stock entitles its holder\nto one vote per share on each proposal submitted to the CPA:18 Stockholders for consideration and to which such holder is entitled to vote, except\nthat as described below under \"Vote Required,\" W. P. Carey, the directors of CPA:18 - Global and their affiliates are not entitled to vote on the\nMerger.\nQuorum\nThe representation, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast at least 50% of all\nthe votes entitled to be cast at the CPA:18 Special Meeting on any matter is necessary to constitute a quorum at the CPA:18 Special Meeting.\nShares of CPA:18 Common Stock represented in person or by proxy will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at\nthe CPA:18 Special Meeting. For the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum, abstentions and \"broker non-votes\" will be included in\ndetermining the number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the CPA:18 Special Meeting.\nVote Required\nApproval of the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all\nthe votes entitled to be cast on the relevant matter. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of\ntheir affiliates owning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote or consent on the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between\nCPA:18 - Global and affiliates of its advisor\u037e and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common\nStock necessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's\n92\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not entitled to cast votes on the matter and will not be included in making such\ndetermination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by any CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not\nbe taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the Merger receives the requisite approval. Abstentions and \"broker non-\nvotes\" will have the same effect as votes against approval of the Merger since each of the proposals requires the affirmative vote of the holders of\na majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nCPA:18 Voting of Proxies\nIf you are a holder of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock on the CPA:18 Record Date, you may authorize a proxy by completing, signing and promptly\nreturning the proxy card in the self-addressed stamped envelope provided. You may also authorize a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or\nover the Internet as described in your proxy card. Authorizing a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or over the Internet will not limit your right\nto attend the CPA:18 Special Meeting virtually and vote via the special meeting website. Those stockholders of record who choose to authorize a\nproxy by telephone or over the Internet must do so no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 25, 2022. All shares of CPA:18 Common Stock\nrepresented by properly executed proxy cards received before or at the CPA:18 Special Meeting and all proxies properly submitted by telephone or\nover the Internet will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards, telephone or\nInternet submissions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be voted \"FOR\" each of the proposals. You\nare urged to indicate how you vote your shares whether you authorize a proxy by proxy card, by telephone or over the Internet.\nIf a properly executed proxy card is returned or properly submitted by telephone or over the Internet and the stockholder has abstained from voting\non one or more of the proposals, the shares of CPA:18 Common Stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at the special meeting for\npurposes of determining a quorum but will not be considered to have been voted on the abstained proposals. For the proposal to approve the\nMerger, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Merger. For the proposal to adjourn the meeting to solicit additional\nproxies, abstentions (which are not considered votes cast) will have no effect on the vote on such proposal.\nIf your shares are held in an account controlled by a broker or financial advisor, you must instruct your broker or financial advisor on how to vote\nyour shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or financial advisor holding shares that indicates that the broker or financial advisor\ndoes not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining\nthe presence of a quorum but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposals. Under applicable rules and regulations, brokers, banks or\nother nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters but do not have the discretion to vote on non-routine matters. The proposal to\napprove the Merger is a non-routine matter. Accordingly, your broker or financial advisor will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on\nhow to vote by following the information provided to you by your broker or financial advisor. If you do not provide voting instructions, your\nshares will be considered \"broker non-votes\" because the broker or financial advisor will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares.\nTherefore, your failure to provide voting instructions to the broker or financial advisor will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the\nMerger.\nAdjournment\nAlthough it is not currently expected, the CPA:18 Special Meeting may be adjourned to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to\napprove the Merger. In that event, CPA:18 - Global may ask its stockholders to vote upon the proposal to consider the adjournment of the CPA:18\nSpecial Meeting to solicit additional proxies but not upon the proposal to approve the Merger. If CPA:18 Stockholders approve this proposal,\nCPA:18 - Global could adjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting and use the time to solicit additional proxies. Any shares of CPA:18 Common Stock that\nwere voted against approval of the Merger will not be voted in favor of the adjournment of the CPA:18 Special Meeting in order to solicit additional\nproxies.\n93\nTable of Contents\nRevocation of Proxies\nAny proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked, and the vote changed, by the person giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies\nmay be revoked by:\n\u2022delivering to the Corporate Secretary of CPA:18 - Global, at or before the vote is taken at the CPA:18 Special Meeting, a later-dated written notice\nstating that you would like to revoke your proxy and change your vote\u037e\n\u2022properly executing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to the Corporate Secretary of CPA:18 - Global before the vote is\ntaken at the CPA:18 Special Meeting\u037e or\n\u2022attending the CPA:18 Special Meeting virtually and voting via the special meeting website, although attendance at the CPA:18 Special Meeting will\nnot in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy or a change of your vote.\nProxies authorized by telephone or via the Internet may only be revoked in writing in accordance with the above instructions.\nAny written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent to CPA:18 - Global, One Manhattan West, 395 9th Avenue, 58th Floor, New\nYork, New York 10001, Attention: Corporate Secretary, so as to be received prior to the CPA:18 Special Meeting, or hand delivered to the Corporate\nSecretary of CPA:18 - Global at or before the taking of the vote at the CPA:18 Special Meeting.\nShares Beneficially Owned by W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global Directors and Officers\nAs of the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey and its affiliates beneficially owned 8,556,733 shares of CPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate,\nrepresenting 5.7% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock, and the directors of CPA:18 - Global beneficially owned 76,223 shares of\nCPA:18 Common Stock in the aggregate, representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of CPA:18 Common Stock. Each share of CPA:18\nCommon Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will automatically be\ncancelled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.\nSolicitation of Proxies\u037e Expenses\nAll expenses of CPA:18 - Global's solicitation of proxies from its stockholders, including the cost of mailing this proxy statement/prospectus to\nCPA:18 Stockholders, will be paid by CPA:18 - Global. CPA:18 - Global may utilize some of the officers and employees of W. P. Carey's wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, CAM, and certain of W. P. Carey\u2019s consultants (who, in each case, will receive no compensation in addition to their regular salaries or\nhourly compensation, as applicable, for these services) to solicit proxies personally and by telephone. In addition, W. P. Carey has engaged\nBroadridge to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the meeting and estimate that W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global will pay Broadridge a fee of\napproximately $200,000. W. P. Carey has also agreed to reimburse Broadridge for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in\nconnection with the proxy solicitation and to indemnify Broadridge against certain losses, costs and expenses. No portion of the amount that W. P.\nCarey is required to pay Broadridge is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. The agreement between W. P. Carey and Broadridge may be\nterminated (i) by either party for any reason upon 90 days' prior written notice, (ii) by the non-defaulting party if the other party fails to cure such\ndefault within 90 days' of written notice thereof, and (iii) by either party if the other party files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or an involuntary\npetition is filed against it, the other party is adjudged bankrupt, a court assumes jurisdiction of the other party's assets under the federal\nreorganization act, a trustee or receiver is appointed by a court for all of a substantial portion of the assets of the other party, the other party\nbecomes insolvent or the other party makes an assignment of its assets for the benefit of its creditors. The agreement between W. P. Carey and\nBroadridge also limits any damages to the fees and costs due and payable to Broadridge.\n94\nTable of Contents\nUnder the CPA:18 Charter and Subtitle 2 of Title 3 of the MGCL, CPA:18 Stockholders are not entitled to dissenting stockholders' appraisal rights,\nrights of objecting stockholders or other similar rights in connection with the Merger or the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nthereby. If the holders of record of CPA:18 Common Stock oppose the Merger, such holders can vote against the Merger by indicating a vote\nagainst the proposal by telephone, electronically via the Internet, by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card, or by voting against the\nMerger in person at the CPA:18 Special Meeting. If the holders of record of CPA:18 Common Stock hold shares in \"street name,\" such holders can\nvote against the Merger in accordance with the voting instructions provided by such holder's bank, broker or other recordholder of the shares of\nCPA:18 Common Stock.\n95",

For a summary of and detailed information regarding the Merger proposal, see the\ninformation about the Merger and the Merger Agreement throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, including the information set forth in\nsections entitled \u201cThe Merger\u201d beginning on page 33 and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d beginning on page 97. A copy of the Merger Agreement is\nattached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, approval of the Merger proposal is a condition to the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger proposal is\nnot approved, the Merger will not be completed.\nApproval of the Merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of CPA:18\nCommon Stock entitled to vote. Pursuant to CPA:18 - Global's organizational documents: (i) its directors, its advisor and any of their affiliates\nowning shares of CPA:18 Common Stock may not vote on or consent to the Merger because the Merger is a transaction between CPA:18 - Global\nand affiliates of its advisor\u037e and (ii) for the purpose of determining the requisite percentage in interest of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock\nnecessary to approve the Merger, any such shares owned by CPA:18 - Global's directors, its advisor or any of their affiliates will be deemed not\nentitled to be voted on the Merger and will not be included in making such determination. Accordingly, shares of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by\nany CPA:18 - Global director, W. P. Carey and any of their affiliates will not be taken into account in determining whether the proposal relating to the\nMerger receives the requisite approval.\nThe CPA:18 - Global board of directors (including the unanimous recommendation of the independent directors) recommends that CPA:18\nStockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Merger proposal.

Approval of the Adjournment proposal requires that the\nnumber of votes cast for the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast against the proposal. If the Adjournment proposal is approved, CPA:18 -\nGlobal may adjourn the CPA:18 Special Meeting to another place, date or time. If the CPA:18 Special Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies, CPA:18 Stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their\nuses.\nThe CPA:18 - Global board of directors (including the unanimous recommendation of the independent directors) recommends that CPA:18\nStockholders vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment proposal.\n96",

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated\nby reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. As a stockholder, you are not a third-party beneficiary of the Merger Agreement and therefore you\nmay not directly enforce any of its terms and conditions.\nThis summary may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global urge\nyou to carefully read the full text of the Merger Agreement because it is the legal document that governs the Merger. The Merger Agreement is not\nintended to provide you with any factual information about W. P. Carey or CPA:18 - Global. In particular, the assertions embodied in the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (and summarized below) are qualified by information in the documents that each\nof W. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global filed with the SEC prior to the Effective Date, as well as by certain disclosure letters, which certain of the parties\ndelivered to other parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, that modify, qualify and create exceptions to the\nrepresentations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or\ncomplete as of any specified date, may apply contractual standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by\ninvestors or that is different from standards of materiality generally applicable under the U.S. federal securities laws or may not be intended as\nstatements of fact but rather as a way of allocating risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties and other\nprovisions of the Merger Agreement, and the description of such provisions in this proxy statement/prospectus, should not be read alone but\ninstead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings that each of W. P. Carey and\nCPA:18 - Global file with the SEC and the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus. See \"Where You Can Find More Information\"\nbeginning on page 171.\nThe Merger\nThe Merger Agreement provides that at the Effective Time, CPA:18 - Global will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as\nthe surviving entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of W. P. Carey. At such time, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the\nMGCL and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the \"MLLCA\"), the separate existence of CPA:18 - Global will cease.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will take place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date specified by the\nparties, which will be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger\nAgreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those\nconditions) (such date, the \"Original Closing Date\"), by means of a virtual closing through the electronic exchange of signatures, or at such other\ntime and place as the parties agree in writing.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their\nnature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived, but the tenant\npurchase options with respect to CPA:18 - Global's Iberian student-housing portfolio subject to the Framework Agreement dated as of December\n20, 2019 (the \"Designated Portfolio\") have been exercised and W. P. Carey is actively working to complete the sale of the Designated Portfolio,\nthen W. P. Carey has the unilateral right to extend the Original Closing Date until the earliest to occur of (x) the second business day following the\nclosing of the sale of the Designated Portfolio\u037e (y) the first business day before August 31, 2022 and (z) the second business day following the date\non which W. P. Carey provides written notice to the CPA:18 Special Committee indicating that it no longer desires to pursue the foregoing extension\noption. If W. P. Carey exercises this extension option, the cash component of the Per Share Merger Consideration will be subject to an upward\nadjustment, as more thoroughly described below.\nThe Effective Time of the Merger will be specified in the Articles of Merger, provided that such time does not exceed 30 days after the Articles of\nMerger are accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and\n97\nTable of Contents\nTaxation of Maryland. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.\nConversion of Securities\nAs of the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of CPA:18 Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share, the rights attaching to such share will be converted automatically into the right to\nreceive, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, merger consideration consisting of (i) 0.0978 (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of a validly\nissued, fully paid and non-assessable share of W. P. Carey Common Stock (the \"stock consideration\"), and (ii) $3.00 in cash, which will be reduced\nif CPA:18 - Global pays a dividend exceeding its regular quarterly dividend and may be increased if W. P. Carey exercises its right under the Merger\nAgreement to defer the closing of the Merger in order to complete the sale of certain CPA:18 - Global properties (including the cash, if any, paid in\nrespect of fractional shares (as more thoroughly described below), the \"cash component,\" and together with the stock consideration, the \u201cPer\nShare Merger Consideration\u201d).\nEach share of CPA:18 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will\nautomatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist. In addition, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey subsidiary will receive any Per\nShare Merger Consideration for any share of CPA:18 Common Stock owned by it. No fractional shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued\nunder the Merger Agreement. To the extent that a holder of CPA:18 Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of W.\nP. Carey Common Stock, computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder will\ninstead receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by $10.45.\nBased on the number of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock outstanding on the CPA:18 Record Date, W. P. Carey expects to issue approximately 13.8\nmillion shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Upon such Stock Issuance, the W. P. Carey Stockholders and the\nCPA:18 Stockholders (excluding W. P. Carey and any W. P. Carey subsidiaries) would own approximately 93% and 7% of the combined company,\nrespectively.\nRecordation of Exchange\u037e Payment of Per Share Merger Consideration\nAs soon as practicable following the Effective Time, W. P. Carey will cause its transfer agent to record the Stock Issuance in connection with the\nMerger to the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock on W. P. Carey's stock records in accordance with the Merger Agreement. No physical share\ncertificates will be delivered. Prior to the Effective Time, W. P. Carey will designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to CPA:18 -\nGlobal to act as agent for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (the \"Paying and Exchange Agent\"). W. P. Carey must take all steps\nnecessary to enable and cause the surviving entity to provide to the Paying and Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time the\naggregate cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon cancellation of the CPA:18 Common Stock in lieu of any fractional\nshare of W. P. Carey Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the tenth business day after the\nEffective Time, the Paying and Exchange Agent will pay to each holder of CPA:18 Common Stock the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to\nreceive for the cash portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration and in lieu of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock.\nShare Transfer Books\nAt the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of CPA:18 - Global will be closed, and no\nsubsequent transfers of shares of CPA:18 Common Stock will be registered on the share transfer books of the surviving entity.\n98\nTable of Contents\nRepresentations and Warranties\nW. P. Carey and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and CPA:18 - Global, on the other hand, have made representations and warranties in the Merger\nAgreement, many of which are qualified as to materiality or subject to matters disclosed by the parties, and none of which survive the Effective\nTime, relating to, among other things:\n\u2022organization, standing and corporate power\u037e\n\u2022capital structure\u037e\n\u2022power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and enforce the Merger Agreement and all other documents to be executed in connection with\nthe transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022no conflicts with, violations of or defaults under organizational documents, certain material contracts or applicable judgments, orders or laws\u037e\n\u2022consents and regulatory approvals necessary to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022information supplied relating to the disclosures in the registration statement and this proxy statement/prospectus\u037e\n\u2022opinions of financial advisors\u037e\n\u2022stockholder approval required (with respect to CPA:18 - Global only)\u037e\n\u2022brokers' fees or commissions\u037e\n\u2022no requirement to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act\u037e\n\u2022exemptions relating to takeover or similar statutes and waiver from ownership limitations in organizational documents (with respect to CPA:18 -\nGlobal only)\u037e\n\u2022availability of SEC documents, internal accounting controls, disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal controls (with\nrespect to W.

Carey only).\n99\nTable of Contents\nCertain representations and warranties were made by W. P. Carey only and not by CPA:18 - Global because of the advisory role in which W. P. Carey\nand its affiliates serve with respect to CPA:18 - Global and the oversight and control that W. P. Carey and its affiliates have over such matters to\nwhich CPA:18 - Global would otherwise represent and warrant.\nCovenants\nW. P. Carey and CPA:18 - Global have agreed that, until the Effective Time, each company will (i) use and cause each of its subsidiaries to use all\ncommercially reasonable efforts to operate its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as conducted\nprior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and to preserve intact in all material respects its current business organization, and (ii) not take\ncertain material actions without the other company's consent, including those actions enumerated in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 4.14 of the Merger\nAgreement.\nW. P. Carey, as the ultimate parent of CAM and W. P. Carey BV, CPA:18 - Global's external advisors, has also agreed to cause CAM, W. P. Carey BV\nand Merger Sub to assist and cooperate in good faith to cause CPA:18 - Global to fulfill all its obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nAdditionally, CAM, W. P. Carey BV and Merger Sub must each, at the request of the CPA:18 Special Committee, assist and cooperate in good faith\nto facilitate CPA:18 - Global's efforts related to CPA:18 Competing Transactions during the go-shop and no-shop periods.\nEach of W. P.

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nDESCRIPTION OF W. P. CAREY SHARES\nThe following contains a summary of certain material provisions of the W. P. Carey Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the \"W. P. Carey\nCharter\") and the W. P. Carey Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \"W. P. Carey Bylaws\") relating to the shares of W. P. Carey Common\nStock that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus and can be found at Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively. The\nfollowing description of the shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to\nthe W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws.\nGeneral\nThe W. P. Carey Charter provides that W. P. Carey has the authority to issue 500,000,000 shares of stock, $0.001 par value per share, consisting of\n450,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. A majority of\nthe entire board of directors of W. P. Carey, without any action by the W. P. Carey Stockholders, may amend the W. P. Carey Charter from time to\ntime to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that W. P. Carey has\nauthority to issue. W. P. Carey expects that approximately 13.8 million shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock will be issued in the Merger.\nCommon Stock\nAll shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger contemplated by this proxy statement/prospectus will be duly authorized,\nvalidly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Subject to the rights of any other class or series of stock and to the provisions of the W. P. Carey\nCharter restricting the transfer and ownership of shares of our stock, each outstanding share of W. P. Carey Common Stock entitles the holder to\none vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including one vote for each director to be elected in the election of directors, and,\nexcept as provided with respect to any other class or series of shares of our stock, the holders of W. P. Carey Common Stock possess exclusive\nvoting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of W.\nP. Carey Common Stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any\ndirectors.\nUnder Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert, sell all or substantially all of its assets,\nengage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless declared advisable by the board of\ndirectors and approved by the affirmative vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the\nmatter, unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation's\ncharter. The W. P. Carey Charter requires the affirmative vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes\nentitled to be cast on the matter to approve such matters, except that any amendment to the sections of the W. P. Carey Charter concerning the\nremoval of directors, restrictions on transfer and ownership of shares and the voting requirements for the amendment of such provisions must be\ndeclared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of\nall the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nMaryland law permits the merger of a 90% or more owned subsidiary with or into its parent without stockholder approval provided (a) the charter of\nthe successor is not amended other than in certain minor respects and (b) the contract rights of any stock of the successor issued in the merger in\nexchange for stock of the other corporation are identical to the contract rights of the stock for which it is exchanged. Also, because Maryland law\nmay not require the stockholders of a parent corporation to approve a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a subsidiary entity,\nincluding where a substantial number of operating assets are held by the subsidiary, as in our situation, our subsidiaries may be able to merge or\nsell all or substantially all of their assets without a vote of W. P. Carey Stockholders.\nHolders of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock are entitled to receive distributions paid ratably on the common stock if and when authorized by\nour board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available for the payment of distributions. They also are entitled to share ratably in\nour assets legally available for distribution to\n122\nTable of Contents\nthe W. P. Carey Stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after payment of or adequate provision has been made for\nall of our known debts and liabilities. These rights are subject to the preferential rights in respect of distributions or upon liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of any other class or series of our stock that we may subsequently classify or reclassify and to the provisions of the W. P. Carey Charter\nregarding restrictions on transfer and ownership of W. P. Carey stock.\nHolders of our shares of stock generally have no appraisal, preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights or preemptive\nrights to subscribe for any of our securities, except as may be provided under the terms of any class or series of stock that we may subsequently\nclassify or reclassify. Subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership of stock contained in the W. P. Carey Charter and the rights of any other\nclass or series of stock that W. P. Carey may subsequently classify or reclassify, each share of common stock has equal distribution, liquidation and\nother rights.\nPreferred Stock\u037e Power to Reclassify Shares of Our Stock\nThe W. P. Carey Charter authorizes the board of directors of W. P. Carey to classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to\nreclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock. Prior to\nissuance of shares of any class or series of stock, our board of directors is required by Maryland law and the W. P. Carey Charter to fix, subject to\nthe W. P. Carey Charter restrictions on transfer and ownership, the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,\nlimitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series of stock. Therefore,\nour board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for you or otherwise be in\nyour best interests.\nPower to Increase or Decrease Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has the power (a) to amend the W. P. Carey Charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares\nof our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue, (b) to issue additional shares of common stock\nor preferred stock and (c) to classify unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock or to reclassify any previously classified, but\nunissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock, into other classes or series of stock and thereafter to issue the classified or reclassified\nshares of stock. We believe this ability provides us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in\nmeeting other needs which might arise. The additional classes or series of stock, as well as our common stock, are available for issuance without\nfurther action by the W. P. Carey Stockholders, unless stockholder action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which\nour securities may be listed or the terms of any classes or series of stock that we may subsequently classify or reclassify. Although our board of\ndirectors does not currently intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series of common or preferred stock that could, depending\nupon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a\npremium price for you or otherwise be in your best interests.\nRestrictions on Ownership and Transfer\nThe W. P. Carey Charter provides that our board of directors may decide whether it is in the best interests of our company to qualify and maintain\nstatus as a REIT under the Code. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, our shares of stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more\npersons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, no more than 50% of\nthe value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined by the Code to include\ncertain entities) during the last half of any taxable year. Neither the requirement to be held by 100 or more persons, or the provision disallowing\nownership by five or fewer individuals apply to the first taxable year of a REIT.\n123\nTable of Contents\nTo help us to qualify as a REIT, among other purposes, the W. P. Carey Charter, subject to certain exceptions, contains restrictions on the number of\nshares of our stock that a person may own. The W. P. Carey Charter provides that generally no person may own beneficially, or be deemed to own\nby virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, either (i) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the\naggregate outstanding shares of our stock excluding any outstanding shares of our stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax\npurposes or (ii) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate outstanding shares of W. P. Carey\nCommon Stock excluding any outstanding shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes.\nThe W. P. Carey Charter also prohibits any person from (a) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would result in our being\n\"closely held\" under Section 856(h) of the Code, (b) transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in our stock being beneficially\nowned by fewer than 100 persons, (c) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would cause us to own, directly or indirectly,\n10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of our company (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by us), (d) beneficially or\nconstructively owning shares of our stock that would cause any independent contractor to not be treated as such under Section 856(d)(3) of the\nCode, or (e) beneficially or constructively owning shares of stock which will otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any person who\nacquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of our stock that will or may violate any of the foregoing\nrestrictions on transferability and ownership, and any person who would have owned shares of our stock that resulted in a transfer of shares to a\ncharitable trust (as described below), will be required to give written notice immediately to us, or in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction,\nto give at least 15 days' prior written notice to us, and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of\nsuch transfer on our status as a REIT. The foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines\nthat it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for us to qualify as a REIT.\nOur board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the above ownership limits and the\nrestrictions described in clauses (c) and (d) above. However, the board of directors may not grant an exemption to any person unless the board of\ndirectors obtains such representations, covenants and undertakings as the board of directors may deem appropriate in order to determine that\ngranting the exemption would not result in losing our status as a REIT. As a condition of granting the exemption, our board of directors may require\na ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the board of directors in its sole discretion, in\norder to determine or ensure our status as a REIT.\nOur board of directors may increase or decrease the common stock ownership limit and/or the aggregate stock ownership limit so long as the\nchange would not result in five or fewer persons beneficially owning more than 49.9% in value of our outstanding stock. Any decrease in the\ncommon stock ownership limit and/or the aggregate stock ownership limit shall not apply to any person whose percentage ownership of stock is in\nexcess of the decreased ownership limits until such time as such person's percentage ownership of stock equals or falls below the decreased\nownership limits. Absent an exemption from the ownership limits, any further acquisition of shares of our stock by such person will be in violation\nof the ownership limits unless and until such person's percentage ownership of stock falls below the ownership limit (in which case such person\nmay acquire shares up to such ownership limits).\nPursuant to the W. P. Carey Charter, if any transfer of our shares of stock occurs that, if effective, would result in any person beneficially or\nconstructively owning shares of stock in excess, or in violation, of the above ownership limitations or restrictions on transfer, known as a\nprohibited owner, then that number of shares of stock, the beneficial or constructive ownership of which otherwise would cause such person to\nviolate the ownership limitations or restrictions on transfer (rounded up to the nearest whole share), will be automatically transferred to a charitable\ntrust for the exclusive benefit of a charitable beneficiary and the prohibited owner will not acquire any rights in such shares. This automatic transfer\nwill be considered effective as of the close of business on the business day before the violative transfer. If the transfer to the charitable trust would\nnot be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of the above transfer or ownership limitations, then the transfer of that number of shares of\nstock that otherwise would cause any person to violate the above limitations will be null and void. Shares of stock held in the charitable trust will\ncontinue to constitute issued and outstanding shares of our stock. The prohibited owner will not benefit economically from ownership of any\nshares of stock held in the charitable trust, will have no\n124\nTable of Contents\nrights to distributions and will not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares of stock held in the charitable trust. The\ntrustee of the charitable trust will be designated by us and must be unaffiliated with us or any prohibited owner and will have all voting rights and\nrights to distributions with respect to shares of stock held in the charitable trust, and these rights will be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the\ntrust's charitable beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid before our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the trustee\nwill be paid by the recipient of such dividend or distribution to the trustee upon demand, and any dividend or other distribution authorized but\nunpaid will be paid when due to the trustee. Any dividend or distribution so paid to the trustee will be held in trust for the trust's charitable\nbeneficiary. The prohibited owner will have no voting rights with respect to shares of stock held in the charitable trust, and, subject to Maryland\nlaw, effective as of the date that such shares of stock have been transferred to the trustee, the trustee, in its sole discretion, will have the authority\nto:\n\u2022rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited owner prior to our discovery that such shares have been transferred to the trustee\u037e and\n\u2022recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the trust's beneficiary.\nHowever, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to rescind and recast such vote.\nWithin 20 days of receiving notice from us that shares of stock have been transferred to the charitable trust, and unless we buy the shares first as\ndescribed below, the trustee will sell the shares of stock held in the charitable trust to a person, designated by the trustee, whose ownership of the\nshares will not violate the ownership limitations in the W. P. Carey Charter. Upon the sale, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold\nwill terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner and to the charitable beneficiary. The prohibited\nowner will receive the lesser of:\n\u2022the price paid by the prohibited owner for the shares or, if the prohibited owner did not give value for the shares in connection with the event\ncausing the shares to be held in the charitable trust (for example, in the case of a gift or devise), the market price of the shares on the day of the\nevent causing the shares to be held in the charitable trust\u037e and\n\u2022the price per share received by the trustee from the sale or other disposition of the shares held in the charitable trust (less any commission and\nother expenses of a sale).\nThe trustee may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited\nowner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. Any net sale proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the prohibited owner will be paid\nimmediately to the charitable beneficiary. If, before our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the charitable trust, such shares are\nsold by a prohibited owner, then:\n\u2022such shares will be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the charitable trust\u037e and\n\u2022to the extent that the prohibited owner received an amount for such shares that exceeds the amount that the prohibited owner was entitled to\nreceive as described above, the excess must be paid to the trustee upon demand.\nIn addition, shares of stock held in the charitable trust will be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal\nto the lesser of:\n\u2022the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the charitable trust (or, in the case of a gift or devise, the market price at the\ntime of the gift or devise)\u037e and\n\u2022the market price on the date we, or our designee, accept such offer.\nWe may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and\nowed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. We may pay the amount of such reduction to the trustee for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary.\nWe will have the right to accept the offer until\n125\nTable of Contents\nthe trustee has sold the shares of stock held in the charitable trust. Upon such a sale to us, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares\nsold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner and any distributions held by the trustee will\nbe paid to the charitable beneficiary.\nAll certificates, if any, representing shares of our stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.\nEvery owner of more than 5% (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder) in value of the\noutstanding shares of our stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, must give written notice to us stating the name and address of\nsuch owner, the number of shares of each class and series of shares of our stock that the owner beneficially owns and a description of the manner\nin which the shares are held. Each such owner must also provide to us such additional information as we may request in order to determine the\neffect, if any, of the owner's beneficial ownership on our status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with our ownership limitations. In addition,\neach of the W. P. Carey Stockholders, whether or not an owner of 5% or more of our stock, must upon demand provide to us such information as we\nmay request, in good faith, in order to determine our status as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental\nauthority or to determine such compliance and to ensure our compliance with the ownership restrictions in the W. P. Carey Charter.\nThe ownership and transfer limitations in the W. P.

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nCERTAIN MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW AND OF THE W. P. CAREY CHARTER AND W. P. CAREY BYLAWS\nThe following description is a summary of certain material provisions of Maryland law and of the W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws. Certain\nprovisions of Maryland law and the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a\ntakeover of the combined company (including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the\nthen current prices). The summary is not complete. We encourage you to read the W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws, which are incorporated by\nreference into this proxy statement/prospectus.\nW. P. Carey Board of Directors\nThe W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board of directors will be not less than the minimum\nnumber required by Maryland law. The W. P. Carey Bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board of directors will not\nexceed 25 and the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board of directors may only\nbe increased or decreased by a vote of a majority of our entire board of directors. The W. P. Carey Charter provides that any and all vacancies on\nthe board of directors (including as a result of an increase in the number of directors constituting our full board of directors) may be filled only by\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. Under the W. P. Carey\nCharter, we have elected to be subject to Section 3-804(c) of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL so that any and all vacancies (including as a result of\nan increase in the number of directors constituting our full board of directors) on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of\na majority of the remaining directors even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. Any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve\nfor the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies. The W. P. Carey\nCharter provides that a director may be removed only for cause and only by the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes\nentitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. \"For cause\" means, with respect to any particular director, conviction of a felony or a final\njudgment of court of competent jurisdiction holding that such director caused demonstrable, material harm to us through bad faith or active and\ndeliberate dishonesty. However, because of the board's exclusive power to fill vacant directorships, stockholders will be precluded from filling the\nvacancies created by any removal with their own nominees. Each member of our board of directors is elected by the W. P. Carey Stockholders to\nserve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. Holders of shares of our common\nstock have no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. In uncontested elections, directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast\nwith respect to such nominee by the stockholders present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. If, however, the number of nominees for election to\nthe board of directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected at that meeting and in certain other contested elections, directors are elected by\na plurality of all the votes cast at that meeting. If the holders of any class or series of stock that we may subsequently classify or reclassify shall\nhave the right to elect one or more directors separately as a class, then such director or directors so elected shall serve for the remainder of the term\nin which such vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies. Additionally, any such director or directors may be removed\nonly by the holders of such class or series.\nAction by Stockholders\nUnder the MGCL, stockholder action by common stockholders can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by unanimous\nconsent in lieu of a meeting, unless the charter provides for a lesser percentage (which the W. P. Carey Charter does not). Stockholder action by\npreferred stockholders can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by a consent in lieu of a meeting by the holders of\nshares entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a stockholders' meeting\nif the corporation gives notice of the action to each holder of the class of stock not later than 10 days after the effective time of the action, unless\nthe charter provides otherwise (which the W. P. Carey Charter does). The W. P. Carey Charter provides that any action required or permitted to be\ntaken at a meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting if a unanimous consent which sets forth the action is given by each\nstockholder entitled to vote on the matter in writing or by electronic transmission. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by our board of\ndirectors, the Chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or our\n127\nTable of Contents\nPresident, and must be called, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and information requirements by the stockholders requesting the\nmeeting, by our Corporate Secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on any\nmatter that may properly be considered at such meeting. These provisions, combined with the advance notice provisions of the W. P. Carey Bylaws,\nwhich are summarized below, may have the effect of delaying consideration of a stockholder proposal until the next annual meeting. (See also \"Risk\nFactors - Risks Related to Our Business - The W. P. Carey Charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of\ncontrol transaction.\")\nAmendment or Supplement to the W. P. Carey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws\nThe W. P. Carey Charter may be amended only if the amendment is declared advisable by the board of directors of W. P. Carey and is approved by\nthe affirmative vote of the W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, unless the\namendment either is permitted to be made without stockholder approval under the MGCL or the W. P. Carey Charter requires a different level of\nstockholder approval. As permitted by the MGCL, the W. P. Carey Charter contains a provision permitting our directors, without any action by the\nW. P. Carey Stockholders, to amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of\nshares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. In addition, the W. P. Carey Charter contains provisions permitting our board\nof directors to classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of\ncommon stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock. The board of directors of W. P. Carey has the power to adopt, amend,\nalter or repeal any provision of the W. P. Carey Bylaws and make new bylaws. In addition, the W. P. Carey Stockholders, by the approval of at least a\nmajority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter, may alter or repeal any provision of the W. P. Carey Bylaws or adopt new provisions of the W.\nP. Carey Bylaws. Any amendment of the provisions of the W. P. Carey Charter relating to the removal of directors, the restrictions on transfer and\nownership of shares or the requirements for the amendment of either of these provisions of the W. P. Carey Charter must be declared advisable by\nour board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast not less than two-thirds of all of the votes entitled\nto be cast on the matter.\nDissolution\nW. P. Carey's dissolution must be declared advisable by a majority of the entire board of directors of W. P. Carey and approved by the affirmative\nvote of the W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nBusiness Combinations\nMaryland law prohibits \"business combinations\" between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years\nafter the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger,\nconsolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or transfer of equity securities, liquidation\nplan or reclassification of equity securities. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as:\n\u2022any person or entity who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock\u037e or\n\u2022an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner,\ndirectly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding stock.\nA person is not an interested stockholder if our board of directors approves in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have\nbecome an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, our board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to\ncompliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by our board of directors.\n128\nTable of Contents\nAfter the five-year prohibition and in addition to any vote otherwise required by Maryland law and the W. P. Carey Charter, any business\ncombination between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by our board of\ndirectors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least:\n\u202280% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our then-outstanding shares of voting stock\u037e and\n\u2022two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our voting stock other than stock held by the interested stockholder with whom or with\nwhose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or stock held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.\nThese super-majority vote requirements do not apply if our common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their\nshares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its stock.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of\ndirectors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.\nPursuant to the statute, the board of directors of W. P. Carey, by resolution, has exempted any business combinations between W. P. Carey and any\nperson who is an existing, or becomes in the future an, \"interested stockholder\". Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote\nrequirements will not apply to business combinations between W. P. Carey and any such person. As a result, such persons may be able to enter\ninto business combinations with W. P. Carey that may not be in the best interest of the W. P. Carey Stockholders, without compliance with the\nsuper-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. Additionally, this resolution may be altered, revoked or repealed in whole\nor in part at any time and W. P. Carey may opt back into the business combination provisions of the MGCL. If this resolution is revoked or repealed,\nthe statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.\nControl Share Acquisitions\nMaryland law provides that holders of \"control shares\" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a \"control share acquisition\" have no voting rights,\nexcept to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the\nmatter. Shares owned by the acquiror or by officers or by employees who are also our directors are excluded from the shares entitled to vote on the\nmatter. \"Control shares\" are voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock currently owned by the acquiring person, or in\nrespect of which the acquiring person is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would\nentitle the acquiring person to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power:\n\u2022one-tenth or more but less than one-third\u037e\n\u2022one-third or more but less than a majority\u037e or\n\u2022a majority or more of all voting power.\nControl shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A\n\"control share acquisition\" means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. A person who has made\nor proposes to make a control share acquisition may compel our board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50\ndays of the demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. The right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting. If no request for a meeting is made, we may present the question at\nany stockholders' meeting.\nIf voting rights are not approved at the stockholders' meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver the statement required by Maryland law,\nthen, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we may redeem any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights have\npreviously been approved, for fair value. Fair value is\n129\nTable of Contents\ndetermined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror\nor of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of the shares were considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are\napproved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may\nexercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares for purposes of these appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by\nthe acquiror in the control share acquisition. The control share acquisition statute does not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or\nshare exchange if we are a party to the transaction, nor does it apply to acquisitions approved by or exempted by the W. P. Carey Charter or W. P.\nCarey Bylaws.\nThe W. P. Carey Bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of W. P.\nCarey stock and, consequently, the control share acquisition statute will not apply to W. P. Carey unless the board of directors of W. P. Carey later\namends the W. P. Carey Bylaws to modify or eliminate this provision, which it may do without W. P. Carey Stockholder approval, and which it may\nmake effective prospectively or retrospectively.\nMaryland Unsolicited Takeovers Act\nSubtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act, and at least\nthree independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding\nany contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of five provisions:\n\u2022a classified board\u037e\n\u2022a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director\u037e\n\u2022a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of directors\u037e\n\u2022a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in\nwhich the vacancy occurred\u037e and\n\u2022a majority requirement for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders.\nIn the W. P. Carey Charter, we have elected that vacancies on the board be filled only by the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do\nnot constitute a quorum, and for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred. Through provisions in the W. P.\nCarey Charter and W. P. Carey Bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we (a) require the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast at least two-\nthirds of all votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors for the removal of any director from the board, (b) vest in the board the\nexclusive power to fix the number of directorships and (c) provide that unless called by our Chairman of our board of directors, our President, our\nChief Executive Officer or our board of directors, a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our Corporate Secretary upon the written\nrequest of (and satisfaction of certain procedural and information requirements by) the stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all\nthe votes entitled to be cast on any matter that may be properly considered at the meeting.\nIn January 2015, the board of directors of W. P. Carey resolved to opt out of the provision of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL that, absent such\nresolution, would have permitted the board of directors of W. P. Carey to unilaterally divide itself into classes without W. P. Carey Stockholder\napproval (commonly referred to as a \"classified board\"). Although W. P. Carey did not have a classified board at that time, by opting out of this\nprovision the board of directors of W. P. Carey cannot elect to become a classified board in the future without approval of the W. P. Carey\nStockholders.\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification\nMaryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation\nand its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:\n\u2022actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services\u037e or\n130\nTable of Contents\n\u2022active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action.\nThe W. P. Carey Charter contains such a provision that eliminates directors' and officers' liability for money damages to the maximum extent\npermitted by Maryland law. These limitations of liability do not apply to liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and do not generally\naffect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission. The W. P. Carey Charter and Bylaws also provide that we must\nindemnify (to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law), and pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a\nproceeding to, any individual who is a present or former director or officer of W. P. Carey or a predecessor of W. P. Carey from and against any claim\nor liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her service in such capacity as a director\nor officer. Additionally, the W. P. Carey Charter provides that we may, indemnify, if and to the extent authorized and determined to be appropriate in\naccordance with applicable law, any person permitted, but not required, to be indemnified under Maryland law by W. P. Carey or a predecessor of\nW. P. Carey.\nMaryland law requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which the W. P. Carey Charter does not) to indemnify a director or\nofficer who has been successful in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she was made, or was threatened to be made, a party by reason of\nhis or her service in that capacity. Maryland law permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others,\nagainst judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which\nthey may be made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that:\n\u2022the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was\nthe result of active and deliberate dishonesty\u037e\n\u2022the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services\u037e or\n\u2022in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.\nHowever, under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or\nfor a judgment of liability on the basis of that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and\nthen only for expenses. In addition, Maryland law permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the\ncorporation's receipt of:\n\u2022a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for\nindemnification by the corporation\u037e and\n\u2022a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined\nthat the standard of conduct was not met.\nWe have adopted an indemnification policy applicable to our officers and directors. The indemnification policy requires, among other things, that\nwe indemnify our (or any predecessor company's) officers and directors, to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, against all reasonable\ncosts, charges, and expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, penalties, fines, and settlements (if such settlement is approved in advance by\nus) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense and/or settlement of any threatened, pending, or completed suit, action, or\nproceeding, and to advance to such officers and directors all related reasonable costs, charges and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by\nthem in connection therewith, subject to reimbursement if it is subsequently determined that indemnification is not permitted. We must also\nadvance all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by our officers and directors seeking to enforce their rights to advancement under the\nindemnification policy and may cover officers and directors under our directors and officers liability insurance. Although the indemnification policy\noffers substantially the same scope of coverage afforded by provisions in our charter and bylaws, it provides greater assurance to officers and\ndirectors that indemnification will be available, because it cannot be modified unilaterally in the future by our board of directors or by the\nstockholders to eliminate the rights that it provides with respect to existing facts.\n131\nTable of Contents\nInsofar as the foregoing provisions permit indemnification of directors, executive officers or persons controlling us for liability arising under the\nSecurities Act, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities\nAct and is therefore unenforceable.\nMeetings of Stockholders\nSpecial meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the Chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer,\nour President and, in the case of a stockholder requested special meeting, must be called by our Corporate Secretary upon the written request of\n(and satisfaction of certain procedural and information requirements by) the stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes\nentitled to be cast on any matter that may be properly considered at such meeting. Only matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be\nconsidered and acted upon at such a meeting.\nAnnual meetings of stockholders for the election of directors and any other business that may be considered and acted upon shall be held on a\ndate and at a time set by our board of directors or, in the absence of such a determination on the second Monday in the month of May at 2:00 p.m.\nEastern Time, if a business day.\nInterested Director and Officer Transactions\nPursuant to the MGCL, a contract or other transaction between us and a director or between us and any other corporation or other entity in which\nany of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or\ninterest, the presence of such director at the meeting at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the\ndirector's vote in favor thereof, if:\n\u2022the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our board of directors or a committee of our board, and our board or\ncommittee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the\ndisinterested directors constitute less than a quorum\u037e\n\u2022the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to the W. P. Carey Stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction\nor contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares\nowned of record or beneficially by the interested director or corporation or other entity\u037e or\n\u2022the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to us.\nW. P. Carey requires that all contracts and transactions between W. P. Carey (including its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of W. P. Carey's\ndirectors or executive officers or any entity in which such director or executive officer is a director or has a material financial interest, on the other\nhand, must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even if less than a quorum.\nAdvance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business\nThe W. P. Carey Bylaws provide that with respect to an annual meeting of W. P. Carey Stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to the\nboard of directors and the proposal of business to be considered by W. P. Carey Stockholders may be made only:\n\u2022pursuant to the notice of the meeting\u037e\n\u2022by or at the direction of the board of directors of W. P. Carey\u037e or\n\u2022by a W. P. Carey Stockholder who is a W. P. Carey Stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting, who is\nentitled to vote at the meeting in the election of the directors then standing for election or on such other business the W. P. Carey Stockholder\nproposes to bring before the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of the W. P. Carey Bylaws.\n132\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to special meetings of W. P. Carey Stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting may be brought before the\nmeeting. Nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors of W. P. Carey at a special meeting may be made only:\n\u2022by or at the direction of the board of directors of W. P. Carey\u037e or\n\u2022provided that the board of directors of W. P. Carey has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a W. P. Carey Stockholder who is\na stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each\nindividual so nominated and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the W. P. Carey Bylaws.\nGenerally, in accordance with the W. P. Carey Bylaws, a W. P. Carey Stockholder seeking to nominate a director or bring other business before our\nannual meeting of W. P. Carey Stockholders must deliver a notice to our Corporate Secretary not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day,\nnor earlier than the 150th day, prior to the anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the prior year's annual meeting of W. P. Carey\nStockholders (for purposes of our 2023 annual meeting, to be timely, such notice must be delivered by a W. P.

P. Carey amended the W. P. Carey Bylaws to allow for proxy access for W. P. Carey Stockholders.\nW. P. Carey Stockholders' Eligibility to Nominate\nThe W. P. Carey Bylaws generally permit any W. P. Carey Stockholder or group of up to 20 W. P. Carey Stockholders who have maintained\ncontinuous qualifying ownership of at least 3% or more of the outstanding W. P.

Carey Stockholder has the right to recall such loaned\nshares, undertakes to recall, and does recall such loaned shares prior to the record date for the annual meeting and maintains qualifying ownership\nof such loaned shares through the date of the meeting.\nProcedure for Selecting Candidates in the Event the Number of Nominees Exceeds 20%\nIf the number of W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates exceeds 20% of the directors in office, each nominating W. P. Carey Stockholder will\nselect one W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidate, beginning with the nominating W. P. Carey Stockholder with the largest qualifying\nownership and proceeding through the list of nominating W. P. Carey Stockholders in descending order of qualifying ownership until the permitted\nnumber of W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates is reached.\nNominating Procedure\nIn order to provide adequate time to assess W. P. Carey Stockholder-nominated candidates, requests to include W. P.

Carey mailed its proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting of W. P. Carey Stockholders.\nInformation Required of All Nominating W. P.

P. Carey Charter contains a provision that limits the liability of its\ndirectors and officers to W. P. Carey and its stockholders for money\ndamages to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of the State of\nMaryland. W. P. Carey must indemnify (to the maximum extent permitted\nby Maryland law), and pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance\nof the final disposition of a proceeding to, any individual who is a\npresent or former director or officer of W. P. Carey or a predecessor of W.\nP. Carey from and against any claim or liability to which such person may\nbecome subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her\nservice in such capacity as a director or officer. W. P.

P. Carey or a predecessor of W. P. Carey.\nW. P. Carey has adopted an indemnification policy applicable to its\nofficers and directors. The indemnification policy requires, among other\nthings, that W. P. Carey indemnify its (or any predecessor company's)\nofficers and directors, to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law,\nagainst all reasonable costs, charges, and expenses (including attorney's\nfees), judgments, penalties, fines, and settlements (if such settlement is\napproved in advance by W.

W. P. Carey must also\nadvance all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by its\nofficers and directors seeking to enforce their rights to advancement\nunder the indemnification policy and may cover officers and directors\nunder its directors and officers liability insurance. Although the\nindemnification policy offers substantially the same scope of coverage\nafforded by provisions in W. P.

        "Section Text": "Table of Contents\nMATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\nThe following is a summary of the material federal income tax considerations of the Merger and holding of W. P. Carey Common Stock. The law firm\nof DLA Piper LLP (US) has acted as counsel and reviewed this summary. For purposes of this section under the heading \"Material Federal Income\nTax Considerations,\" references to \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" mean only W. P. Carey and not its subsidiaries or other lower-tier entities, except as\notherwise indicated. This summary is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Treasury, rulings and other\nadministrative pronouncements issued by the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect, and all of which are subject to differing\ninterpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not\nsustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. We have not sought and do not currently expect to seek an advance\nruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary is also based upon the assumption that we\nwill operate W. P. Carey and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities in accordance with their applicable organizational documents. This summary is for\ngeneral information only and does not purport to discuss all aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light\nof its investment or tax circumstances or to investors subject to special tax rules, such as:\n\u2022financial institutions\u037e\n\u2022insurance companies\u037e\n\u2022broker-dealers\u037e\n\u2022regulated investment companies\u037e\n\u2022partnerships and trusts\u037e\n\u2022persons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022persons who hold our stock on behalf of other persons as nominees\u037e\n\u2022persons who receive our stock through the exercise of employee stock options (if we ever have employees) or otherwise as compensation\u037e\n\u2022persons holding our stock as part of a \"straddle,\" \"hedge,\" \"conversion transaction,\" \"constructive ownership transaction,\" \"synthetic security\"\nor other integrated investment\u037e\n\u2022\"S\" corporations\u037e and, except to the extent discussed below:\n\u2022tax-exempt organizations\u037e and\n\u2022foreign investors.\nThis summary assumes that investors will hold their shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock as a capital asset, which generally means as property held\nfor investment.\nThe federal income tax treatment of the Merger and holding of W. P. Carey Common Stock depends in some instances on determinations of fact and\ninterpretations of complex provisions of federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, the tax\nconsequences to any particular stockholder of the Merger and holding our common stock will depend on the stockholder's particular tax\ncircumstances. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the federal, state, and local and foreign income and other tax consequences to\nyou in light of your particular investment or tax circumstances of the Merger and of acquiring, holding, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of our\ncommon stock.\nThe Merger\nAt the closing of the Merger, Clifford Chance US LLP, tax counsel to CPA:18 - Global and DLA Piper LLP (US), tax counsel to W. P. Carey, will each\ndeliver an opinion substantially to the effect that the Merger will be\n147\nTable of Contents\ntreated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code. In accordance with this treatment, no gain or loss will be recognized\nby W. P. Carey, CPA:18 - Global or their stockholders as a result of the Merger except to the extent of cash received as consideration in the Merger.\nIn addition, at the closing of the Merger, Clifford Chance US LLP will deliver an opinion that commencing with its taxable year ended December 31,\n2018, through the closing of the Merger, CPA:18 - Global has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and\ntaxation as a REIT under the Code. For purposes of such opinion, which will be in a form customary for transactions of this nature, Clifford Chance\nUS LLP may rely on customary assumptions and representations of CPA:18 - Global reasonably acceptable to W. P. Carey.\nIt must be emphasized that the opinions of Clifford Chance US LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) will be based on various assumptions relating to the\norganization and operation of CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub, including that all factual representations and statements set forth in all\nrelevant documents, records and instruments are true and correct, all actions described in this proxy statement/prospectus are completed in a timely\nfashion and that CPA:18 - Global, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub, have at all times operated in accordance with the method of operation described in\ntheir organizational documents and this proxy statement/prospectus. Additionally, the opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP regarding the REIT\nqualification of CPA:18 - Global will be conditioned upon factual representations and covenants made by the management of CPA:18 - Global and\naffiliated entities regarding the organization, assets, conduct of business operations of CPA:18 - Global and other items regarding CPA:18 - Global's\nability to have met the various requirements for qualification as a REIT, and assumes that such representations and covenants are accurate and\ncomplete and that CPA:18 - Global has taken no action inconsistent with its qualification as a REIT. While CPA:18 - Global believes that it is\norganized and has operated so that it has qualified as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing\nimportance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in circumstances or applicable law, no assurance can be given by Clifford\nChance US LLP or CPA:18 - Global that it has so qualified for any particular year. Clifford Chance US LLP will have no obligation to advise CPA:18 -\nGlobal or the holders of CPA:18 Common Stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed or of any subsequent\nchange in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, that no ruling has been or will be sought\nfrom the IRS on the tax consequences of the Merger or the REIT qualification of CPA:18 - Global, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will\nnot take, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the federal income tax consequences set forth below.\nIn addition, the opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP regarding the REIT qualification of CPA:18 - Global will be conditioned on the assumption that\nseven non-U.S. subsidiaries of CPA:18 - Global will be granted by the IRS an extension of time to file, and will properly and timely file, elections to\nbe treated as partnerships or entities disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, effective shortly after their acquisition by\nCPA:18 - Global. These entities default to being treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but CPA:18 - Global can elect to treat\nthese entities as partnerships or entities disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which we refer to as flow-through\nentities. CPA:18 - Global intended to elect to treat each of these entities as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the time that\nthe entities were acquired but inadvertently failed to make such elections. CPA:18 - Global has requested an extension of time from the IRS,\npursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-3, to timely elect to treat these entities as flow-through entities effective shortly after the\nacquisition of the entities by CPA:18 - Global. CPA:18 - Global believes that it meets the requirements to be granted such extensions and that\ntherefore CPA:18 - Global will be able to treat these subsidiaries as flow-through entities in prior years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the IRS may\ndisagree with CPA:18 - Global's position and decide not to grant the extension, which would adversely impact the conclusion of Clifford Chance US\nLLP's opinion that CPA:18 - Global has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT\nunder the Code.\nIf the IRS does not grant the extension of time to file these elections, then these subsidiaries would be treated as non-U.S. corporations during\ncertain prior periods. Because interests in non-U.S. corporations are not qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests, CPA:18 - Global's\nownership of such subsidiaries would cause CPA:18 - Global to fail to satisfy certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs during such prior\nperiods. In that event, CPA:18 - Global would either fail to qualify as a REIT beginning with such prior periods, in which case CPA:18 - Global would\nbe liable for substantial corporate income taxes for such prior periods, or if CPA:18 - Global were able to\n148\nTable of Contents\nestablish that it acted with reasonable cause and not willful neglect, CPA:18 - Global could maintain its REIT qualification but would be required to\npay a penalty tax with respect to such failures, which could be material in amount. Prior to the Merger, any such taxes would be liabilities of CPA:18\n- Global. Moreover, to the extent that CPA:18 - Global is liable for such penalty taxes, or if CPA:18 - Global fails to qualify as a REIT, following the\nMerger, the liability for any such penalty taxes or any corporate income taxes owed by CPA:18 - Global as a result of its failure to qualify as a REIT\nwould generally become liabilities of W. P. Carey. The remainder of the discussion in this proxy statement / prospectus, unless otherwise noted,\nassumes that the IRS will grant such extensions and the seven subsidiaries will be treated as flow-through entities for the relevant prior periods.\nBased on the foregoing opinions of counsel as to the tax treatment of the Merger, the material federal income tax consequences to CPA:18\nStockholders will be as follows:\n\u2022except as discussed below under \"Cash Consideration,\" no gain or loss will be recognized by CPA:18 Stockholders on the exchange of CPA:18\nCommon Stock for W. P. Carey Common Stock pursuant to the Merger\u037e\n\u2022the aggregate basis of the W. P. Carey Common Stock received by a CPA:18 Stockholder in the Merger (including fractional shares of W. P. Carey\nCommon Stock deemed received and exchanged for cash as described below) will equal the aggregate basis of the CPA:18 Common Stock for which\nit is exchanged, decreased by the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) by such\nCPA:18 Stockholder and increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized by such CPA:18 Stockholder (calculated as described below under \"-\nCash Consideration\")\u037e and\n\u2022the holding period of W. P. Carey Common Stock received in exchange for shares of CPA:18 Common Stock (including fractional shares of W. P.\nCarey Common Stock deemed received and exchanged for cash as described below) will include the holding period of the CPA:18 Common Stock\nfor which it is exchanged.\nIf a CPA:18 Stockholder acquired different blocks of CPA:18 Common Stock at different times or at different prices, such U.S. holder's holding\nperiod and basis will be determined separately with respect to each block of CPA:18 Common Stock.\nCash Consideration. A CPA:18 Stockholder\u2019s receipt of cash in exchange for its CPA:18 Common Stock in the Merger will generally result in such\nCPA:18 Stockholder recognizing gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the amount of cash\n(excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) received by such CPA:18 Stockholder and the fair market\nvalue of the W. P. Carey Common Stock (including the fair market value of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) received by such\nCPA:18 Stockholder, over (b) such CPA:18 Stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares CPA:18 Common Stock exchanged by such CPA:18\nStockholder in the Merger, or (ii) the amount of cash (excluding cash received in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock) received by\nsuch CPA:18 Stockholder. In addition, a CPA:18 Stockholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock in the\nMerger will be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the Merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share for cash.\nAs a result, such holder of CPA:18 Common Stock will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received\nand the basis in such holder's fractional share interest as set forth above.\nAny gain or loss recognized by a CPA: 18 Stockholder due to its receipt of cash in the Merger will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-\nterm capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the Merger, the CPA:18 Stockholder's holding period for the relevant shares is greater than one\nyear. For CPA:18 Stockholders that are non-corporate holders, long-term capital gain generally will be taxed at a federal income tax rate that is lower\nthan the rate for ordinary income or for short-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nIf any cash is paid to a CPA:18 Stockholder that is a \"non-U.S. holder\" (as defined below under \"- Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders\"), W. P. Carey will\nwithhold from such payment a 15% U.S. FIRPTA withholding tax unless the non-U.S. holder is able to establish that the payment is exempt from, or\notherwise not subject to, such withholding.\n149\nTable of Contents\nThe non-U.S. holder may seek a refund from the IRS of amounts withheld if it files a proper return establishing that the amount withheld exceeds the\namount of U.S. income tax imposed on the transaction.\nAs a result of the Merger, CPA:18 - Global will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements in the U.S. Department of Treasury\nRegulations, which will require reporting certain facts regarding the Merger.\nTaxation of W. P. Carey\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We believe that we have been organized and\noperated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT.\nThe law firm of DLA Piper LLP (US) is acting as our tax counsel in connection with this offering. At the closing of the Merger and in connection\nwith this offering, DLA Piper LLP (US) will render an opinion that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018, we have been\norganized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our current and proposed method of\noperation as described in the proxy statement/prospectus and Form S-4 will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a\nREIT. It must be emphasized that the opinion of DLA Piper LLP (US) will be based on various assumptions relating to our organization and\noperation and conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our organization, assets, and\nincome, and the future conduct of our business operations. While we believe that we have been organized and operated and intend to continue to\noperate so that we qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual\ndeterminations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given by DLA Piper LLP (US) or by us that we will\nqualify as a REIT for any particular year. The opinion of DLA Piper LLP (US) will be expressed as of the date issued. DLA Piper LLP (US) has no\nobligation to advise us or the W. P. Carey Stockholders of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any\nsubsequent change in the applicable law. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given\nthat the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions.\nQualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels, and\ndiversity of stock and asset ownership, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code, the compliance with which will not be\nreviewed by DLA Piper LLP (US). Our ability to qualify as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests, some of which depend upon the\nfair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly. Such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination. Accordingly, no\nassurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as\na REIT.\nTaxation of REITs in General\nAs indicated above, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various qualification\nrequirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. The material qualification requirements are summarized below under \"- Requirements for REIT\nQualification - General.\" While we intend to operate so that we qualify as a REIT, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our\nqualification, or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the REIT requirements in the future. See \"- Failure to Qualify\" for any potential\ntax consequences if we fail to qualify as a REIT.\nProvided that we qualify as a REIT, generally we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and will not be subject to U.S. federal\ncorporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to the W. P. Carey Stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the\n\"double taxation\" at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation. In general, the income that we\ngenerate and distribute currently is taxed only at the stockholder level upon a distribution of dividends to the W. P. Carey Stockholders.\nMost domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are taxed on corporate dividends at preferential rates. With limited exceptions,\nhowever, dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as REITs are generally not eligible for the preferential rates and will be taxed at rates\napplicable to ordinary income (subject to the\n150\nTable of Contents\napplicability of certain deductions as discussed in \"Taxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders - Distributions\"). See \"Taxation of Stockholders -\nTaxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders - Distributions.\"\nNet operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes of REITs generally do not pass through to the W. P. Carey Stockholders. See\n\"Taxation of Stockholders.\"\nIf we qualify as a REIT, we will nonetheless be subject to U.S. federal tax in the following circumstances:\n\u2022We will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed \"real estate investment trust taxable income,\" including undistributed net capital\ngains.\n\u2022If we have net income from prohibited transactions, which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for\nsale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property, such income will be subject to a 100% tax. See \" - Prohibited\nTransactions\" below.\n\u2022If we have (1) net income from the sale or other disposition of \"foreclosure property\" held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of\nbusiness or (2) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income. To\nthe extent that income from foreclosure property is otherwise qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, this tax is not\napplicable. Subject to certain other requirements, foreclosure property generally is defined as property we acquired through foreclosure or after a\ndefault on a loan secured by the property or a lease of the property. See \"- Foreclosure Property\" below.\n\u2022We may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain. In that case, a stockholder would include its proportionate share of our\nundistributed net capital gain (to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the stockholder) in its income, would be deemed to have\npaid the tax that we paid on such gain, and would be allowed a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax deemed to have been paid and\nan adjustment would be made to increase the basis of the stockholder's basis in our stock.\n\u2022If we should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, as discussed below, but nonetheless maintain our qualification\nas a REIT because we satisfy other requirements, we will be required to pay a tax equal to (1) the greater of (A) the amount by which we fail to\nsatisfy the 75% gross income test and (B) the amount by which we fail to satisfy the 95% gross income test, multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to\nreflect our profitability.\n\u2022If we should fail to satisfy the asset tests (other than certain de minimis failures) or other requirements applicable to REITs, as described below, and\nyet maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may be\nsubject to an excise tax. In that case, the amount of the excise tax will be at least $50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will\nbe determined as the amount of net income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate (currently 21%) if that\namount exceeds $50,000 per failure.\n\u2022If we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (a) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (b) 95% of our REIT\ncapital gain net income for such year, and (c) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a nondeductible 4%\nexcise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of (i) the amounts that we actually distributed and (ii) the amounts we retained and\nupon which we paid income tax at the corporate level.\n\u2022We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record keeping requirements\nintended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT's stockholders, as described below in \"- Requirements for\nQualification - General.\"\n\u2022If we fail to comply with the requirement to send annual letters to the W. P. Carey Stockholders requesting information regarding the actual\nownership of our stock, and the failure is not due to reasonable cause or due to willful neglect, we will be subject to a $25,000 penalty, or if the\nfailure is intentional, a $50,000 penalty.\n151\nTable of Contents\n\u2022A 100% tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a \"taxable REIT subsidiary\" (\"TRS\") (as described below) that do not reflect arms-\nlength terms.\n\u2022If we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., a corporation taxable under subchapter C of the Code) in a transaction\nin which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the\nsubchapter C corporation, we may be subject to tax on such built-in gain (determined as of the date on which we acquired the assets) at the highest\ncorporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the five-year period\nfollowing their acquisition from the subchapter C corporation. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain\nassume that the C corporation will refrain from making an election to recognize gain with respect to the disposition of the assets under the\napplicable U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations on its tax return for the year in which we acquire the asset from the C corporation. The IRS has\nissued final U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations that exclude from the application of this built-in gains tax any gain from the sale of property\nwe acquired in an exchange under Section 1031 (a like kind exchange) or 1033 (an involuntary conversion) of the Code.\n\u2022Our subsidiaries that are C corporations, including our TRS, generally will be required to pay federal corporate income tax on their earnings.\nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, franchise,\nproperty and other taxes on our assets and operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently\ncontemplated.\nRequirements for REIT Qualification - General\nThe Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:\n(1)that is managed by one or more trustees or directors\u037e\n(2)the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest\u037e\n(3)that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for Sections 856-860 of the Code\u037e\n(4)that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the Code\u037e\n(5)the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons\u037e\n(6)in which, during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned, actually or constructively, by\nfive or fewer \"individuals\" (including certain specified tax-exempt entities)\u037e and\n(7)which meets other tests described below, including with respect to the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions.\nThe Code provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year, and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335\ndays of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Conditions (5) and (6) need not be met during a\ncorporation's initial tax year as a REIT. For purposes of condition (6), the term \"individual\" includes a supplemental unemployment compensation\nbenefit plan, a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes, but generally does not\ninclude a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust.\nWe believe that we have been organized, have operated and have issued sufficient shares of capital stock with sufficient diversity of ownership to\nallow us to satisfy conditions (1) through (7) inclusive, during the relevant time periods. In addition, the W. P. Carey Charter provides restrictions\nregarding the ownership and transfers of our shares, which are intended to assist us in satisfying the share ownership requirements described in\nconditions (5) and\n152\nTable of Contents\n(6) above. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in\nconditions (5) and (6) above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements, except as provided in the next two sentences, our\nqualification as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the rules contained in applicable U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations that\nrequire us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know, or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence, that we failed to meet the requirement described in condition (6) above, we will be treated as having met this requirement. Moreover, if our\nfailure to satisfy the share ownership requirements is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, we may retain our REIT qualification but will\nbe required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. See \"- Failure to Qualify.\"\nTo monitor compliance with the share ownership requirements, we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our\nshares. To do so, we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock pursuant to which\nthe record holders must disclose the actual owners of the shares (i.e., the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income). We must\nmaintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records. We could be subject to monetary penalties if\nwe fail to comply with these record-keeping requirements. If you fail or refuse to comply with the demands, you will be required by U.S. Department\nof Treasury Regulations to submit a statement with your tax return disclosing your actual ownership of our shares and other information.\nIn addition, a corporation generally may not elect to become a REIT unless its taxable year is the calendar year. We have adopted December 31 as\nour year-end, and thereby have satisfied and will continue to satisfy this requirement.\nThe Code provides relief from violations of certain of the REIT requirements, in cases where a violation is due to reasonable cause and not to willful\nneglect, and other requirements are met, including, in certain cases, the payment of a penalty tax that is based upon the magnitude of the violation.\nSee \"- Income Tests\" and \"- Asset Tests\" below. If we fail to satisfy any of the various REIT requirements, there can be no assurance that these\nrelief provisions would be available to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and, if such relief provisions are available, the amount of\nany resultant penalty tax could be substantial.\nSubsidiary Entities\nOwnership of partnership interests\nIf we are a partner in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (references herein to \"partnership\" include limited\nliability companies that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations provide that\nwe are deemed to own our proportionate share of the partnership's assets based on our interest in partnership capital (subject to special rules\nrelating to the 10% asset test described below), and to earn our proportionate share of the partnership's income, for purposes of the asset and\ngross income tests applicable to REITs. In addition, the assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our\nhands. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any of our subsidiary partnerships will be treated as our assets and items\nof income for purposes of applying the REIT requirements. If we become a limited partner (or member) in any partnership or limited liability\ncompany taxed as a partnership and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT or require us to\npay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company taxed as a\npartnership could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in\ntime to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could\nfail to qualify as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below.\nPursuant to applicable partnership audit rules, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any\npartner's distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are generally assessed and collected at the\npartnership level regardless of changes in composition of the partners (or their relative ownership) between the year under audit and the year of the\nadjustment. The partnership audit rules also include an elective alternative method under which the additional taxes resulting from\n153\nTable of Contents\nthe adjustment are assessed from the affected partners, subject to a higher rate of interest than otherwise would apply. The partnership audit rules\ncould result in a partnership in which we own an interest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit\nadjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and\npenalties even though we, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit\nadjustment.\nDisregarded subsidiaries\nIf we own a corporate subsidiary that is a \"qualified REIT subsidiary\" (a \"QRS\"), that subsidiary is generally disregarded for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, and all of the subsidiary's assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit are treated as our assets, liabilities and items of\nincome, deduction and credit, including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to REITs. A QRS is any corporation, other than\na TRS, that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by a REIT. A QRS is not required to pay federal income tax, and our ownership of the stock of a\nQRS does not violate the restrictions on ownership of securities, as described below under \"- Asset Tests.\" Other entities that are wholly owned by\nus, including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for federal income tax purposes, are also\ngenerally disregarded as separate entities for federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of the REIT gross income and asset tests.\nDisregarded subsidiaries, along with any partnerships in which the W. P. Carey may hold an equity interest, are sometimes referred to in this proxy\nstatement/prospectus as \"pass-through subsidiaries.\"\nWe currently hold substantially all of our real estate assets through a series of pass-through subsidiaries, primarily through limited liability\ncompanies that we believe will be treated as disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes. In the future, we may hold investments through\nentities treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.\nIn the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly owned - for example, if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a\nperson other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of ours - the subsidiary's separate existence would no longer be disregarded for federal\nincome tax purposes. Instead, the subsidiary would have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation.\nSuch an event could, depending on the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements\napplicable to REITs, including the requirement that REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the securities of another\ncorporation. See \" - Asset Tests\" and \" - Income Tests.\"\nForeign Assets and Subsidiaries\nWith respect to any foreign properties, we have maintained, and will continue to maintain, appropriate books and records for our foreign properties\nin local currencies. Accordingly, for federal income tax purposes, including the 75% and 95% gross income tests summarized herein, our income,\ngains and losses from our foreign operations that are not held in TRSs will generally be calculated first in the applicable local currency, and then\ntranslated into United States dollars at appropriate exchange rates. On the periodic repatriation of monies from such foreign operations to the\nUnited States, we will be required to recognize foreign exchange gains or losses\u037e however, any foreign exchange gains we recognize from\nrepatriation are expected to constitute \"real estate foreign exchange gains\" under Section 856(n)(2) of the Code, and will thus be excluded from the\n75% and 95% gross income tests summarized below.\nIn addition, we own interests in entities that are both TRSs and \"controlled foreign corporations\" for federal income tax purposes, and we are\ndeemed to receive our allocable share of certain income, referred to as Subpart F Income, earned by such controlled foreign corporations whether or\nnot that income is actually distributed to us. Numerous exceptions apply in determining whether an item of income is Subpart F Income, including\nexceptions for rent received from an unrelated person and derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. Rents from real property are\ngenerally treated as earned in an active trade or business if the landlord/licensor regularly performs active and substantial management and\noperational functions with respect to the property while it is leased, but only if such activities are performed through the landlord/licensor's own\nofficers or staff of employees. We believe our controlled foreign corporations generally do not satisfy this active rental exception however, and as a\nresult we may\n154\nTable of Contents\nrecognize material amounts of Subpart F Income. Further, beginning with our 2018 taxable year we must include in gross income the \"global\nintangible low-taxed income\" in respect of our CFCs. Based on advice of counsel, we believe that our \"global intangible low-taxed income\" and any\nSubpart F Income we recognize qualifies under the 95% gross income test. However, we do not believe our \"global intangible low-taxed income\" or\nour Subpart F income qualifies under the 75% gross income test.\nREIT subsidiaries\nSome of our subsidiaries may also be taxable as REITs. Provided such entities qualify as REITs under the Code, our equity in such entities will be a\nqualifying REIT asset under the quarterly REIT asset tests described below, and any dividends and/or gain on disposition of such equity will be\nqualifying REIT gross income under both the 75% and 95% gross income tests discussed below.\nTaxable REIT subsidiaries\nWe will jointly elect with certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiary corporations, whether or not wholly owned, to treat such subsidiary\ncorporations as TRSs. We generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value,\nunless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS or other taxable corporation is not\nignored for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a TRS or other taxable corporation generally would be subject to corporate income tax on its\nearnings, which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate, and may reduce our ability to make distributions\nto the W. P. Carey Stockholders.\nWe are not generally treated as holding the assets of a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary\nearns. Rather, the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands, and we treat the distributions paid to us from such taxable\nsubsidiary, if any, as income, gain, or return of capital, as applicable. This treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations, as described\nbelow. Because we do not generally include the assets and income of TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations in determining our compliance\nwith the REIT requirements, we will use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the REIT rules might otherwise preclude us from doing\ndirectly or through pass-through subsidiaries. For example, we may use TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations to conduct activities that\ngive rise to certain categories of income such as management fees or activities that would be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions.\nIncome Tests\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each\ntaxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in \"prohibited transactions\" and certain hedging and foreign\ncurrency transactions, generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including interest income\nderived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), \"rents from real property,\"\ndistributions received from other REITs, and gains from the sale of real estate assets (including REIT shares), as well as specified income from\ntemporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions and\ncertain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of such income from investments in real property (i.e., generally income that\nqualifies under the 75% gross income test described above), as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or\nsecurities, which need not have any relation to real property.\nWe and our subsidiaries may hold investments in and pay taxes to foreign countries. Taxes that we pay in foreign jurisdictions may not be passed\nthrough to, or used by, the W. P. Carey Stockholders as a foreign tax credit or otherwise. Our foreign investments might also generate foreign\ncurrency gains and losses. For purposes of either one or both of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, two categories of foreign currency gain may\nbe excluded from gross income: \"real estate foreign exchange gain\" and \"passive foreign exchange gain.\" Real estate foreign exchange gain is not\ntreated as gross income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Real estate foreign exchange gain includes gain derived from\ncertain qualified business units of the REIT and foreign currency gain attributable to (i) qualifying income under the 75% gross income test, (ii) the\nacquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property, or (iii) being an obligor on an obligation\nsecured\n155\nTable of Contents\nby mortgages on real property or on interests in real property. In addition, passive foreign exchange gain is not treated as gross income for\npurposes of the 95% gross income test only. Passive foreign exchange gain includes real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain\nattributable to (i) qualifying income under the 95% gross income test, (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations, or (iii) being the obligor on\nobligations and that, in the case of (ii) and (iii), does not fall within the scope of the real estate foreign exchange definition. In all cases, we intend\nthat any foreign currency transactions will be structured in a manner that will not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. No assurance can be given\nthat any foreign currency gains that we recognize directly or through pass-through subsidiaries will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the\nREIT qualification requirements.\nInterest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test to the extent that the obligation upon which\nsuch interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property or on interests in real property. If we receive interest income with respect to a\nmortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property, and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable\nyear exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan, the interest income will be\napportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the 75% gross\nincome test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property, provided that an obligation secured in part by a mortgage on\npersonal property is treated as secured solely by real property for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of the personal\nproperty does not exceed 15% of the total of the fair market value of the real and personal property. Even if a loan is not secured by real property, or\nis undersecured, the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% gross income test.\nTo the extent that the terms of a loan provide for contingent interest that is based on the cash proceeds realized upon the sale of the property\nsecuring the loan (a \"shared appreciation provision\"), income attributable to the participation feature will be treated as gain from sale of the\nunderlying property, which generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests provided that the real\nproperty is not held as inventory or dealer property or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. To the extent that we\nderive interest income from a mortgage loan or income from the rental of real property (discussed below) where all or a portion of the amount of\ninterest or rental income payable is contingent, such income generally will qualify for purposes of the gross income tests only if it is based upon\nthe gross receipts or sales and not on the net income or profits of the borrower or lessee. This limitation does not apply, however, where the\nborrower or lessee leases substantially all of its interest in the property to tenants or subtenants to the extent that the rental income derived by the\nborrower or lessee, as the case may be, would qualify as rents from real property had we earned the income directly.\nRents received by us will qualify as \"rents from real property\" in satisfying the gross income requirements described above only if several\nconditions are met. If rent is partly attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property, the portion of the rent that is\nattributable to the personal property will not qualify as \"rents from real property\" unless it constitutes 15% or less of the total rent received under\nthe lease. In addition, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. Amounts received\nas rent, however, generally will not be excluded from rents from real property solely by reason of being based on fixed percentages of gross receipts\nor sales. Moreover, for rents received to qualify as \"rents from real property,\" we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or\nrender services to the tenants of such property, other than through an \"independent contractor\" from which we derive no revenue and that meets\ncertain other requirements or through a TRS. We are permitted, however, to perform services that are \"usually or customarily rendered\" in\nconnection with the rental of space for occupancy only and which are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property. In\naddition, we may directly or indirectly provide noncustomary services to tenants of our properties without disqualifying all of the rent from the\nproperty if the income from such services does not exceed 1% of the total gross income from the property. For purposes of this test, we are deemed\nto have received income from such non-customary services in an amount at least 150% of the direct cost of providing the services. Moreover, we\nare generally permitted to provide services to tenants or others through a TRS without disqualifying the rental income received from tenants for\npurposes of the income tests. Also, rental income will qualify as rents from real property only to the extent that we do not directly or constructively\nhold a 10% or greater interest, as measured by vote or value, in the lessee's equity.\n156\nTable of Contents\nWe may directly or indirectly receive distributions from TRSs or other corporations that are not REITs or QRSs. These distributions generally are\ntreated as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation. Such dividends will generally constitute\nqualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any dividends that we receive\nfrom a REIT, however, will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 95% and 75% gross income tests.\nIf we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may still qualify as a REIT for such year if we are\nentitled to relief under applicable provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will be generally available if (1) our failure to meet these tests was\ndue to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and (2) following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income test\nfor any taxable year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test\nfor such taxable year in accordance with U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the\nbenefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances. If these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances, we will not\nqualify as a REIT. As discussed above under \" - Taxation of REITs in General,\" even where these relief provisions apply, the Code imposes a tax\nbased upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular gross income test.\nAsset Tests\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy certain tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our\ntotal assets must be represented by some combination of \"real estate assets,\" cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, and, under some\ncircumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, real estate assets include interests in real property and\ninterests in mortgages on real property or interest in real property, such as land, buildings, leasehold interests in real property, stock of other\ncorporations that qualify as REITs, for taxable years after December 31, 2015, debt instruments issued by REITs which are required to file annual\nand periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act (\"publicly offered REITs\") subject to certain limitations, and some kinds of mortgage-\nbacked securities and mortgage loans. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% test are subject to the additional asset tests described\nbelow.\nSecond, the value of any one issuer's \"securities\" (defined to exclude \"real estate assets\") that we own (other than a TRS or QRS) may not exceed\n5% of the value of our total assets.\nThird, we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 10% asset tests\ndo not apply to securities of TRSs and QRSs and the 10% asset test by value does not apply to \"straight debt\" having specified characteristics and\nto certain other securities described below. Solely for purposes of the 10% asset test by value, the determination of our interest in the assets of a\npartnership in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership, excluding for this\npurpose certain securities described in the Code, as well as our equity interest in the partnership, if any.\nFourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets (25% for taxable years ending\nbefore January 1, 2018). Fifth, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is represented by securities (other than those securities includable\nas \"real estate assets.\") Sixth, for taxable years after December 31, 2015, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is represented by\nnonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments.\nNotwithstanding the general rule, as noted above, that for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests we are treated as owning our proportionate\nshare of the underlying assets of a subsidiary partnership, if we hold indebtedness issued by a partnership, the indebtedness will be subject to,\nand may cause a violation of, the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying mortgage asset or other conditions are met. Similarly, although\nstock of another REIT is a qualifying asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, any non-mortgage debt that is issued by another REIT may not so\nqualify (such debt, however, will not be treated as a \"security\" for purposes of the 10% asset test by value, as explained below).\nCertain relief provisions are available to REITs to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain REIT qualification notwithstanding certain violations\nof the asset and other requirements. One such provision allows a\n157\nTable of Contents\nREIT which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its REIT qualification if (i) the REIT provides the IRS with a\ndescription of each asset causing the failure, (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) the REIT pays a tax equal to the\ngreater of (A) $50,000 per failure, and (B) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest\napplicable corporate tax rate (currently 21%), and (iv) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day\nof the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame.\nIn the case of de minimis violations of the 10% and 5% asset tests, a REIT may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if\n(1) the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT's total assets and $10,000,000, and (2) the REIT either\ndisposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or the relevant tests are\notherwise satisfied within that time frame.\nCertain securities will not cause a violation of the 10% asset test described above. Such securities include instruments that constitute \"straight\ndebt.\" A security does not qualify as \"straight debt\" where a REIT (or a controlled TRS of the REIT) owns other securities of the same issuer which\ndo not qualify as straight debt, unless the value of those other securities constitute, in the aggregate, 1% or less of the total value of that issuer's\noutstanding securities. In addition to straight debt, the Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10% asset test. Such\nsecurities include (1) any loan made to an individual or an estate, (2) certain rental agreements pursuant to which one or more payments are to be\nmade in subsequent years (other than agreements between a REIT and certain persons related to the REIT under attribution rules), (3) any\nobligation to pay rents from real property, (4) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of\n(or payments made by) a non-governmental entity, (5) any security (including debt securities) issued by another REIT, and (6) any debt instrument\nissued by a partnership if the partnership's income is of a nature that it would satisfy the 75% gross income test described above under \" - Income\nTests.\" In applying the 10% asset test by value, a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent, if any, of the REIT's\nproportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership.\nWe believe that our holdings of securities and other assets comply with the foregoing REIT asset requirements, and we intend to monitor\ncompliance on an ongoing basis. Certain mezzanine loans we make or acquire may qualify for the safe harbor of Revenue Procedure 2003-65\npursuant to which certain loans secured by a first priority security interest in ownership interests in a partnership or limited liability company will be\ntreated as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% real estate asset test and the 10% vote or value test, and the income derived therefrom will\nconstitute qualifying income for purposes of the 95% and 75% gross income tests. See \" - Income Tests.\" We may make some mezzanine loans that\ndo not qualify for that safe harbor, qualify as \"straight debt\" securities or qualify for one of the other exclusions from the definition of \"securities\"\nfor purposes of the 10% value test. We intend to make such investments in such a manner as not to fail the asset or gross income tests described\nabove.\nSome of our assets will consist of goodwill. We do not expect the value of any such goodwill to be significant, and, in any event, to negatively\nimpact our compliance with the REIT asset tests.\nNo independent appraisals will be obtained to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or\nsecurities. Moreover, values of some assets, may not be susceptible to a precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future.\nFurthermore, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances,\nwhich could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our\ninterests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT asset tests.\nIf we should fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if (1) we\nsatisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (2) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset\nrequirements was not wholly or partly caused by an acquisition of non-qualifying assets, but instead arose from changes in the market value of our\nassets. If the condition described in (2) were not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy\n158\nTable of Contents\nwithin 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of relief provisions described above.\nAnnual Distribution Requirements\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to the W. P. Carey Stockholders in an\namount at least equal to:\n(1)the sum of\n(i)90% of our \"REIT taxable income,\" computed without regard to our net capital gains and the dividends paid deduction, and\n(ii)90% of our net income, if any, (after tax) from foreclosure property (as described below), minus\n(2)the sum of specified items of non-cash income.\nWe generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file\nour tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In order for dividends paid with\nrespect to taxable years prior to 2015, to provide a tax deduction for us for such years, the distributions must not be \"preferential dividends.\" A\ndistribution is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is (i) pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and (ii) in\naccordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents. For taxable years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to publicly offered REITs. We are a publicly offered REIT.\nTo the extent that we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our \"REIT taxable income,\" as adjusted, we will be subject to tax at ordinary\ncorporate tax rates on the retained portion. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute, our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains.\nIn this case, we could elect for the W. P. Carey Stockholders to include their proportionate shares of such undistributed long-term capital gains in\nincome, and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that we paid. Our stockholders would then increase their adjusted basis of\ntheir stock by the difference between (1) the amounts of capital gain distributions that we designated and that they include in their taxable income,\nand (2) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income.\nTo the extent that we have available net operating losses carried forward from prior REIT tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of\ndistributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. Such losses, however, will generally not affect the\ncharacter, in the hands of the W. P. Carey Stockholders, of any distributions that are actually made as ordinary dividends or capital gains. See \" -\nTaxation of Stockholders - Taxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders - Distributions.\" A REIT's deduction for any NOL carryforwards arising from\nlosses it sustains in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of a REIT's taxable income (determined without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid), and any unused portion of losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 may not be carried back,\nbut may be carried forward indefinitely. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act) eliminates this 80%\nlimitation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021.\nIf we should fail to distribute during a calendar year at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (2) 95% of our REIT\ncapital gain net income for such year, and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a non-deductible 4%\nexcise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (i) the amounts actually distributed, and (ii) the amounts of income for the\ntaxable year we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax.\nIt is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between (1) our\nactual receipt of cash, including receipt of distributions from our subsidiaries,\n159\nTable of Contents\nand (2) our inclusion of items in income for federal income tax purposes. Other potential sources of non-cash taxable income include:\n\u2022\"residual interests\" in a real estate mortgage investment conduit or taxable mortgage pools\u037e\n\u2022loans or mortgage-backed securities held as assets that are issued at a discount and require the accrual of taxable economic interest in advance of\nreceipt in cash\u037e and\n\u2022loans on which the borrower is permitted to defer cash payments of interest, and distressed loans on which we may be required to accrue taxable\ninterest income even though the borrower is unable to make current servicing payments in cash.\nIn the event that such timing differences occur, in order to meet the distribution requirements, it might be necessary for us to arrange for short-term,\nor possibly long-term, borrowings, or to pay distributions in the form of taxable in-kind distributions of stock or other property.\nWe may be able to rectify a failure to pay sufficient dividends for any year by paying \"deficiency dividends\" to stockholders in a later year. These\ndeficiency dividends may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year, but an interest charge would be imposed upon us for\nthe delay in distribution.\nFailure to Qualify\nIf we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification other than the gross income or asset tests, we could avoid disqualification if our\nfailure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Relief provisions are available for\nfailures of the gross income tests and asset tests, as described above in \" - Income Tests\" and \" - Asset Tests.\"\nIf we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions described above do not apply, we would be subject to tax,\nincluding any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We cannot deduct dividends to stockholders in\nany year in which we do not qualify to be taxed as a REIT, nor would we be required to make distributions in such a year. In this situation, to the\nextent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates will generally\nbe taxable at qualified dividend rates. In addition, subject to the limitations of the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends\nreceived deduction. Unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as\na REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. It is not possible to state whether, in all circumstances, we\nwould be entitled to this statutory relief.\nSale-Leaseback Transactions\nOur investments may be in the form of sale-leaseback transactions. We normally intend to treat these transactions as true leases for federal income\ntax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a true lease\nbut is more properly treated in some other manner, such as a financing arrangement or loan for federal income tax purposes. Even if our sale-\nleasebacks are treated as secured loans, for purposes of the REIT asset tests and the 75% gross income test, each \"loan\" would likely be\nconsidered to be collateralized by real property to the extent of the fair market value of the underlying property. As a result, we believe that we\nwould continue to meet the REIT assets tests and gross income tests. However, it is possible that if one or more of our leases were recharacterized\nas a financing, the recharacterization of one or more of these transactions could cause us to fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or gross income\ntests described above based upon the asset we would be treated as holding or the income we would be treated as having earned as a result of such\nrecharacterization, and such failure could result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if one or more of our leases were recharacterized as a\nloan, tax attributes associated with the ownership of real property - principally depreciation - would not be available to us, and the timing of our\nincome inclusion would be affected. These changes in amount or timing of income inclusion or the loss of depreciation deductions resulting from\nthe recharacterization could cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement described\n160\nTable of Contents\nabove for one or more taxable years absent the availability of the deficiency dividend procedure or might result in a larger portion of our dividends\nbeing treated as ordinary income to the W. P. Carey Stockholders.\nProhibited Transactions\nNet income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% tax. The term \"prohibited transaction\" generally includes a sale or\nother disposition of property (other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary\ncourse of a trade or business. We intend to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) will be treated as, or as\nhaving been, held for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business.\nWhether property is held \"primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business\" depends on the particular facts and\ncircumstances. No assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as property held for sale to customers, or that we can\ncomply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of\nproperty that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will potentially be subject to tax in the hands of the\ncorporation at regular corporate rates.\nForeclosure Property\nForeclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property (1) that we acquire as the result of having bid on the\nproperty at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after a default (or\nupon imminent default) on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property, (2) for which we acquired the related\nloan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated, and (3) with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as\nforeclosure property. We generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate (currently 21%) on any net income from foreclosure property,\nincluding any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of\nthe 75% gross income test. Any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the\n100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above, even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property. To\nthe extent that we receive any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test, we intend to make\nan election to treat the related property as foreclosure property.\nDerivatives and Hedging Transactions\nWe and our subsidiaries may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exposure on one or more of our\nassets or liabilities. Hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps,\ninterest rate cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. Except to the extent provided by\nU.S. Department of Treasury Regulations, any income from a hedging transaction we entered into (i) in the normal course of our business primarily\nto manage risk of interest rate, inflation and/or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations\nincurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets, which is clearly identified as specified in U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations\nbefore the closing of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction,\n(ii) primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the 75% or\n95% gross income tests and (iii) for taxable years after December 31, 2015, primarily to manage risk with respect to a prior hedge entered into in\nconnection with property that has been disposed of or liabilities that have been extinguished, in each case which is clearly identified as such before\nthe closing of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross\nincome tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-\nqualifying income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not\njeopardize our qualification as a REIT. We may conduct some or all of our hedging activities through our TRS or other corporate entity, the income\nfrom which may be subject to federal income tax, rather than by participating in the arrangements directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. No\nassurance can be given, however, that our hedging activities will\n161\nTable of Contents\nnot give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of either or both of the REIT gross income tests, or that our hedging activities will not\nadversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements.\nTaxation of Stockholders\nTaxation of Taxable Domestic Stockholders\nDefinitions - In this section, the phrase \"domestic stockholder\" means a holder of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock that for federal income tax\npurposes is:\n\u2022a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States\nor of any political subdivision thereof\u037e\n\u2022an estate, the income of which is subject to federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022a trust, if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the\nauthority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.\nIf a partnership, including for this purpose any entity that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, holds shares of W. P. Carey\nCommon Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the\npartnership. An investor that is a partnership and the partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors about the federal income tax\nconsequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares of W. P. Carey Common Stock.\nDistributions. So long as we qualify as a REIT, the distributions that we make to our taxable domestic stockholders out of current or accumulated\nearnings and profits that we do not designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by stockholders as ordinary income and\nwill not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporations. With limited exceptions, our dividends are not eligible for taxation at the\npreferential income tax rates (i.e., the 20% federal income tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers) for qualified dividends received by domestic\nstockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates from taxable C corporations. For taxable years prior to 2026, individual stockholders are\ngenerally allowed to deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends distributed by us, subject to certain limitations, which would\nreduce the maximum marginal effective federal income tax rate for individuals on the receipt of such ordinary dividends to 29.6%. Such\nstockholders, however, are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by and received from REITs to the extent that the dividends are\nattributable to:\n\u2022income retained by the REIT in the prior taxable year on which the REIT was subject to corporate level income tax (less the amount of tax)\u037e\n\u2022dividends received by the REIT from TRSs or other taxable C corporations\u037e or\n\u2022income in the prior taxable year from the sales of \"built-in gain\" property acquired by the REIT from C corporations in carryover basis transactions\n(less the amount of corporate tax on such income).\nDistributions that we designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taxed to our domestic stockholders as long-term capital gains, to the\nextent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year, without regard to the period for which the stockholder\nthat receives such distribution has held its stock. We may elect to retain and pay taxes on some or all of our net long-term capital gains, in which\ncase provisions of the Code will treat a stockholder as having received, solely for tax purposes, its pro rata share of our undistributed capital gains,\nand the stockholders will receive a corresponding credit for taxes that we paid on such undistributed capital gains. See \"Annual Distribution\nRequirements.\" Corporate stockholders may be required to treat up to 20% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. Subject to the\ndiscussion below on additional Medicare tax on net investment income, long-term capital gains are generally taxable at maximum federal income tax\nrates of 20% in the case of stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates, and 21% in the case of stockholders that are\n162\nTable of Contents\ncorporations. Capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than 12 months are subject to a 25% maximum federal\nincome tax rate for taxpayers who are taxed as individuals, to the extent of previously claimed depreciation deductions.\nDistributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will generally represent a return of capital and will not be taxable to a\nstockholder to the extent that the amount of such distributions does not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares in respect of which\nthe distributions were made. Rather, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the stockholder's shares. To the extent that such distributions\nexceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder's shares, the stockholder generally must include such distributions in income as long-term capital gain,\nor short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less. In addition, any dividend that we declare in October, November or\nDecember of any year and that is payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and\nreceived by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that we actually pay the dividend before the end of January of the following\ncalendar year.\nTo the extent that we have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount\nof distributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See \"Annual Distribution Requirements.\" Such\nlosses, however, are not passed through to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources, nor would such losses\naffect the character of any distributions that we make, which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have\ncurrent or accumulated earnings and profits.\nDispositions of our stock. If a domestic stockholder sells or disposes of shares of our capital stock, it generally will recognize gain or loss for\nfederal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on\nthe sale or other disposition and its adjusted basis in the shares of capital stock for tax purposes. This gain or loss will generally be long-term\ncapital gain or loss if the stockholder has held the capital stock for more than one year at the time of such sale or disposition. In general, capital\ngains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates upon the sale or disposition of our stock will be subject to preferential rates if the stock is held\nfor more than one year, and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if the stock is held for one year or less. Gains recognized by stockholders that are\ncorporations are subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of 21%, whether or not such gains are classified as long-term capital gains. Capital\nlosses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our stock that was held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be\nconsidered long-term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income\n(except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of\nshares of our stock by a stockholder who has held the shares for six months or less, after applying holding period rules, will be treated as a long-\nterm capital loss to the extent of distributions that we make that are required to be treated by the stockholder as long-term capital gain.\nIf an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our stock or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it\nis possible that the provisions of U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations involving \"reportable transactions\" could apply, with a resulting\nrequirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These regulations, though directed towards \"tax shelters,\" are\nbroadly written and apply to transactions that may not typically be considered tax shelters. The Code imposes significant penalties for failure to\ncomply with these requirements. You should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or\ndisposition of our stock or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly. Moreover, you should be aware that we and\nother participants in the transactions in which we are involved (including their advisors) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements\npursuant to these regulations.\nAdditional Medicare Tax on Unearned Income. Certain \"high income\" taxable domestic stockholders, including individuals, estates and trusts, will\nbe subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on their \"net investment\" income. The temporary 20% deduction allowed by Section 199A of the\nCode, as added by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with respect to ordinary REIT dividends received by non-corporate taxpayers is allowed only for\npurposes of Chapter 1 of the Code and thus is apparently not allowed as a deduction allocable to such dividends for purposes of determining the\namount of net investment income subject to the 3.8% Medicare tax, which is imposed under\n163\nTable of Contents\nChapter 2A of the Code. U.S. stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the additional Medicare tax resulting\nfrom an investment in our shares.\nPassive Activity Losses and Investment Interest Limitations. Distributions that we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a domestic\nstockholder of our stock will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, stockholders will not be able to apply any \"passive losses\"\nagainst income or gain relating to our stock. To the extent that distributions we make do not constitute a return of capital, they will be treated as\ninvestment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Holders\nThe following is a summary of certain federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our stock applicable to\ncertain non-U.S. holders. A \"non-U.S. holder\" is any person other than a domestic stockholder or an entity treated as a partnership for federal\nincome tax purposes.\nThe following discussion is based on current law, and is for general information only. It addresses only selected, and not all, aspects of federal\nincome and estate taxation.\nOrdinary dividends. The portion of distributions received by non-U.S. holders that (i) is payable out of our earnings and profits, (ii) is not\nattributable to our capital gains and (iii) is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder, will be subject to U.S.\nwithholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless reduced or eliminated by treaty. We generally plan to withhold U.S. income tax at the rate of 30% on the\ngross amount of any such distribution paid to a non-U.S. holder unless either:\n\u2022a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. stockholder files an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E evidencing eligibility for that reduced\nrate with us\u037e or\n\u2022the non-U.S. stockholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.\nReduced treaty rates and other exemptions are not available to the extent that income is attributable to excess inclusion income (i.e., certain income\nfrom taxable mortgage pools or REMIC residual interests) allocable to the non-U.S. holder. Accordingly, we will withhold at a rate of 30% on any\nportion of a distribution that is paid to a non-U.S. holder and attributable to that holder's share of our excess inclusion income. As required by IRS\nguidance, we intend to notify the W. P. Carey Stockholders if a portion of a distribution paid by us is attributable to excess inclusion income.\nSubject to the discussion below, in general, non-U.S. holders will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely as a result of\ntheir ownership of our stock. In cases where the dividend income from a non-U.S. holder's investment in our stock is, or is treated as, effectively\nconnected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to federal income tax at\ngraduated rates, in the same manner as domestic stockholders are taxed with respect to such distributions. Such income must generally be reported\non a U.S. income tax return filed by or on behalf of the non-U.S. holder. The income may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of\na non-U.S. holder that is a corporation.\nNon-dividend distributions. Unless our stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (a \"USRPI\"), distributions that we make that are not out of\nour earnings and profits will not be subject to U.S. income tax. If we cannot determine at the time a distribution is made whether or not the\ndistribution will exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to\nordinary dividends. The non-U.S. holder may seek a refund from the IRS of any amounts withheld if it is subsequently determined that the\ndistribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. If our stock constitutes a USRPI, as described below,\ndistributions that we make in excess of the sum of (i) the stockholder's proportionate share of our earnings and profits, plus (ii) the stockholder's\nbasis in its stock, will be taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (\"FIRPTA\") (unless an exemption to FIRPTA applies\nfor a specific non-U.S. holder) at the rate of tax, including any applicable capital gains rates, that would apply to a domestic stockholder of the same\ntype (e.g., an individual or a corporation, as the case may be), and the collection of the tax\n164\nTable of Contents\nwill be enforced by a refundable withholding at a rate of 15% of the amount by which the distribution exceeds the stockholder's share of our\nearnings and profits.\nCapital gain distributions. Under FIRPTA, a distribution that we make to a non-U.S. holder, to the extent attributable to gains from dispositions of\nUSRPIs that we held directly or through pass-through subsidiaries, or \"USRPI capital gains,\" will, except as described below, be considered\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder and will be subject to U.S. income tax at the rates applicable to U.S.\nindividuals or corporations, without regard to whether we designate the distribution as a capital gain distribution. See above under \"- Ordinary\nDividends,\" for a discussion of the consequences of income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. In addition, we will be\nrequired to withhold tax equal to 21% of the amount of distributions to the extent the distributions constitute USRPI capital gains. Distributions\nsubject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation. A distribution is not a\nUSRPI capital gain if we held an interest in the underlying asset solely as a creditor. Capital gain distributions received by a non-U.S. holder that are\nattributable to dispositions of our assets other than USRPIs are not subject to federal income or withholding tax, unless (1) the gain is effectively\nconnected with the non-U.S. holder's U.S. trade or business and, if certain treaties apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment\nmaintained by the non-U.S. holder, in which case the non-U.S. holder would be subject to the same treatment as U.S. holders with respect to such\ngain, or (2) the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year\nand has a \"tax home\" in the United States, in which case the non-U.S. holder will incur a 30% tax on his or her capital gains.\nA capital gain distribution that would otherwise have been treated as a USRPI capital gain will not be so treated or be subject to FIRPTA, and\ngenerally will not be treated as income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and instead will be treated in the same manner as\nan ordinary dividend, if (1) the capital gain distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established\nsecurities market located in the United States, and (2) the recipient non-U.S. holder does not own more than 5% of that class of stock at any time\nduring the year ending on the date on which the capital gain distribution is received. The shares of our Common Stock are listed on the NYSE under\nthe symbol \"WPC.\"\nDispositions of our stock. Unless our stock constitutes a USRPI, a sale of our stock by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S.\ntaxation under FIRPTA. Our stock could be treated as a USRPI if 50% or more of our assets at any time during a prescribed testing period consist of\ninterests in real property located within the United States, excluding, for this purpose, interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor. We\nexpect to meet this 50% test.\nEven if the foregoing 50% test is met, however, our stock nonetheless will not constitute a USRPI if we are a \"domestically-controlled qualified\ninvestment entity.\" A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT, less than 50% of value of which is held directly or\nindirectly by non-U.S. holders at all times during a specified testing period. In addition, certain favorable presumptions aid in determination of\nwhether we are a domestically-controlled qualified entity. We believe that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity, and that a\nsale of our stock should not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA.\nIn the event that we are not a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity, but our stock is \"regularly traded,\" as defined by applicable U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, a non-U.S. holder's sale of our common stock nonetheless would not be\nsubject to tax under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI, provided that the selling non-U.S. holder held 10% or less of our outstanding common stock at all\ntimes during a specified testing period.\nIf gain on the sale of our stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, or in the absence of a specific exemption for a non-U.S. holder, the non-U.S.\nholder would be required to file a federal income tax return and would be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. stockholder with respect to such\ngain, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of non-resident alien individuals, and the\npurchaser of the stock could be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the IRS.\n165\nTable of Contents\nFIRPTA Exemption - Qualified Shareholders. Subject to the exception discussed below, any distribution to a \"qualified shareholder\" who holds\nstock of a REIT directly or indirectly (through one or more partnerships) will not be subject to United States tax as income effectively connected\nwith a United States trade or business and thus will not be subject to special withholding rules under FIRPTA. While a \"qualified shareholder\" will\nnot be subject to FIRPTA withholding on REIT distributions, certain investors of a \"qualified shareholder\" (i.e., non-United States persons who\nhold interests in the \"qualified shareholder\" (other than interests solely as a creditor), and hold more than 10% of the stock of the REIT in which the\n\"qualified shareholder\" holds stock (whether or not by reason of the investor's ownership in the \"qualified shareholder\")) may be subject to\nFIRPTA withholding.\nA \"qualified shareholder\" is a foreign person that (i) either is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty which includes an\nexchange of information program and whose principal class of interests is listed and regularly traded on one or more recognized stock exchanges\n(as defined in such comprehensive income tax treaty), or is a foreign partnership that is created or organized under foreign law as a limited\npartnership in a jurisdiction that has an agreement for the exchange of information with respect to taxes with the United States and has a class of\nlimited partnership units representing greater than 50% of the value of all the partnership units that is regularly traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ\nmarkets, (ii) is a qualified collective investment vehicle (defined below), and (iii) maintains records on the identity of each person who, at any time\nduring the foreign person's taxable year, is the direct owner of 5% or more of the class of interests or units (as applicable) described in (i), above.\nA qualified collective investment vehicle is a foreign person that (i) would be eligible for a reduced rate of withholding with respect to ordinary\ndividends under the comprehensive income tax treaty described above, even if such entity holds more than 10% of the stock of such REIT, (ii) is\npublicly traded (as defined in Section 7704(b) of the Code), is treated as a partnership under the Internal Revenue Code, is a withholding foreign\npartnership for purposes of United States withholding taxes, and would be treated as a United States real property holding company if it were a\ndomestic corporation, or (iii) is designated as such by the Secretary of the Treasury and is either (a) fiscally transparent within the meaning of\nSection 894 of the Code, or (b) required to include dividends in its gross income, but is entitled to a deduction for distributions to its investors.\nFIRPTA Exemption - Qualified Foreign Pension Funds. Any distribution treated as a capital gain to a \"qualified foreign pension fund\" or an entity\nall of the interests of which are held by a \"qualified foreign pension fund\" who holds REIT stock directly or indirectly (through one or more\npartnerships) will generally not be subject to United States tax as income effectively connected with a United States trade or business and thus will\nnot be subject to the withholding rules under FIRPTA.\nA qualified foreign pension fund is any trust, corporation, or other organization or arrangement (i) which is created or organized under the law of a\ncountry other than the United States, (ii) which is established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are\ncurrent or former employees (or persons designated by such employees) of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered, (iii)\nwhich does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government\nregulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established\nor operates and (v) with respect to which, under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates, (A) contributions to such\norganization or arrangement that would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such entity\nor taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of any investment income of such organization or arrangement is deferred or such income is taxed at a\nreduced rate.\nWash sales - In general, special wash sale rules apply if a stockholder owning more than 5% of our common stock avoids a taxable distribution of\ngain recognized from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests by selling our common stock before the ex-dividend date of the distribution\nand then, within a designated period, enters into an option or contract to acquire shares of the same or a substantially identical class of our\ncommon stock. If a wash sale occurs, then the seller/repurchaser will be treated as having gain recognized from the sale or exchange of U.S. real\nproperty interests in the same amount as if the avoided distribution had actually been received. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax\nadvisors on the special wash sale rules that apply to non-U.S. holders.\n166\nTable of Contents\nEstate tax - If our stock is owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident (as specially defined for federal estate tax\npurposes) of the United States at the time of such individual's death, the stock will be includable in the individual's gross estate for federal estate\ntax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and may therefore be subject to federal estate tax.\nFATCA Withholding\nForeign Accounts\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\"FATCA\"), generally impose a\nwithholding tax of 30% on payments of U.S. source dividend, interest or other fixed or determinable annual or periodic income and gross proceeds\nfrom the disposition of property of a type that can produce U.S.-source dividends or interest to certain foreign persons, whether as the beneficial\nowner or as an intermediary for the ultimate beneficial owner, including both (i) a \"foreign financial institution\" (as defined in the Code), unless\nsuch institution is \"deemed compliant,\" complies with the rules implementing an applicable intergovernmental agreement and/or enters into an\nagreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of\nsuch institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities\nwith U.S. owners) and (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution in certain cases, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a\ncertification identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the entity, which generally include any U.S. person who directly or indirectly owns more than\n10% of the entity.\nUnder applicable U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, FATCA withholding generally applies to payments of\ndividends on our capital stock. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other\ndisposition of stock on or after January 1, 2019, proposed U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of\ngross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers may generally rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations\nare issued. Certain countries have entered into, and other countries are expected to enter into, agreements with the U.S. to facilitate the type of\ninformation reporting required under FATCA. While the existence of such agreements will not eliminate the risk that payments to foreign financial\ninstitutions or non-financial foreign entities in those countries will be subject to FATCA withholding, these agreements are expected to reduce the\nrisk of the withholding for investors in those countries. If you hold our stock through a foreign account or intermediary, you are urged to consult\nyour tax advisor regarding the implications of FATCA to you.\nTaxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders\nTax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts, generally are exempt from\nfederal income taxation. However, they may be subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (\u201cUBTI\u201d). While some investments in\nreal estate may generate UBTI, the IRS has ruled that dividend distributions from a REIT to a tax-exempt employee pension trust do not\nautomatically constitute UBTI. Based on that ruling, and provided that (1) a tax-exempt stockholder has not held our stock as \"debt financed\nproperty\" within the meaning of the Code (e.g., where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt\nstockholder), and (2) our stock is not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business, distributions that we make and income from the sale of our\nstock generally should not give rise to UBTI to a tax-exempt stockholder.\nTax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified\ngroup legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20) of the Code are subject to\ndifferent UBTI rules, which generally require such stockholders to characterize distributions that we make as UBTI.\nIn certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock by value could be required to treat a percentage of its distributions\nas UBTI, if we are a \"pension-held REIT.\" We will not be a pension-held REIT unless either (1) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value\nof our stock, or (2) a group of pension trusts, each individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock, collectively owns more than 50%\nof the value of our stock. Certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock should generally prevent a tax-exempt entity\n167\nTable of Contents\nfrom owning more than 10% of the value of our stock and should generally prevent us from becoming a \"pension-held REIT.\"\nTax-exempt stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of\nowning our stock.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nWe will report to our domestic stockholders and the IRS the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year and the amount of any tax\nwithheld. Under the backup withholding rules, a domestic stockholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to dividends paid unless\nthe holder is a corporation or comes within other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or provides a taxpayer identification\nnumber or social security number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable\nrequirements of the backup withholding rules. A domestic stockholder that does not provide his or her correct taxpayer identification number or\nsocial security number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. In addition, we may be\nrequired to withhold a portion of a capital gain distribution to any domestic stockholder who fails to certify its non-foreign status.\nWe must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. stockholder the amount of dividends paid to such holder and the tax withheld with\nrespect to such dividends, regardless of whether withholding was required. Copies of the information returns reporting such dividends and\nwithholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. stockholder resides under the provisions of an\napplicable income tax treaty. A non-U.S. stockholder may be subject to backup withholding unless applicable certification requirements are met.\nPayment of the proceeds of a sale of our common stock within the U.S. is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the\nbeneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. stockholder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to\nknow that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of our common\nstock conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to information reporting (but not backup withholding) unless the\nfinancial intermediary has documentary evidence in its records that the beneficial owner is a non-U.S. stockholder and specified conditions are met\nor an exemption is otherwise established. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against\nsuch holder's federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.\nLegislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the\nU.S. Department of Treasury. Changes to the federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our stock.\nState, Local and Foreign Taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries and stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or\nthey transact business, own property or reside. We own real property assets located in numerous jurisdictions and will be required to file tax\nreturns in some of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or foreign tax treatment and that of the W. P. Carey Stockholders may not conform to the\nfederal income tax treatment discussed above. We may own foreign real estate assets and pay foreign property taxes, and dispositions of foreign\nproperty or operations involving, or investments in, foreign real estate assets may give rise to foreign income or other tax liability in amounts that\ncould be substantial. Any foreign taxes that we incur do not pass through to stockholders as a credit against their federal income tax liability.\nProspective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws on\nan investment in our stock.\n168",
