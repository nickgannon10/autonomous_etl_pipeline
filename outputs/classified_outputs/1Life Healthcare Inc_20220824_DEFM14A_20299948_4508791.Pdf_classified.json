Since the Merger is subject to a number of\nconditions, the exact timing of the Merger cannot be determined at this time.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not be entitled to,\nnor will they receive, any payment for their shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, 1Life will remain an independent\npublic company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to\nfile periodic reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC. Under certain specified circumstances, 1Life will be required to pay Amazon the 1Life\nTermination Fee upon or following the termination of the Merger Agreement and under certain other specified circumstances, Amazon will be\nrequired to pay 1Life the Amazon Termination Fee following the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy\nstatement captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees and Expenses.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of 1Life\u2019s common stock as of the Record Date is required to adopt the\nMerger Agreement.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (ii) grant a proxy over the\nInternet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card)\u037e or (iii) vote virtually at the Special Meeting will have the\nsame effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present\nat the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a\nvote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nHow many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?\nA:\nThe presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares\nof stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Special Meeting. Assuming the Special Meeting is held\nsolely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be present in person at the Special Meeting, and only\nshares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Your shares of\ncommon stock will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or\nother nominee), if you vote at the meeting or if you attend the Special Meeting virtually but abstain from voting. If you return a properly signed and\ndated proxy card without indicating voting preferences on the proxy card, your shares of common stock will be counted as present for purposes of\ndetermining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors. The\nSpecial Meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and do not give any instruction to\nyour broker, bank or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting for any proposal, those shares will not be\nentitled to vote on any proposal at the Special Meeting and will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. However, if you hold your\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but give no\ninstruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a\nquorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be voted\nwith respect to any other proposal.\nAs of the close of business on August 22, 2022, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, there were 195,812,174, shares of common stock\noutstanding.\nQ:\nWhy are the stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?\nA:\nThe Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require 1Life to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that\nmay be paid or become payable to certain of its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if\napplicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter, provided a quorum\nis present. Assuming the Special Meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, as it is currently scheduled to be, no shares will be\npresent in person at the Special Meeting, and only shares present virtually or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will be able to be voted.\nThe approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.\n17\nTable of Contents\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires either (i) if a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person,\nby remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote generally on the\nsubject matter or (ii) if a quorum is not present, the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nHow does the 1Life Board of Directors recommend that I vote?\nA:\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends that 1Life stockholders vote:\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal\u037e and\n\u2022\n\u201cFOR\u201d the Adjournment Proposal.\nFor a discussion of the factors that the Board of Directors considered in determining to recommend that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement, please see the section captioned \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement \u2014 The Board of Directors\u2019\nRecommendation\u037e 1Life Adverse Recommendation Change.\u201d In addition, when considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors, you\nshould be aware that some of 1Life\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of stockholders more generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section captioned \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Interests of 1Life\u2019s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will happen if the stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is\nan advisory vote and will not be binding on 1Life. Therefore, if the other requisite stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed,\nthe amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will be payable to 1Life\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with the terms and\nconditions of the applicable agreements, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this\nCompensation Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?\nA:\nIf you abstain from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if you voted \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger, the\nCompensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. However, abstentions are counted as shares present or represented by proxy at the Special\nMeeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. As a result, an abstention of any of the aforementioned\nproposals will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but will count as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d each of the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.\nFailure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will also\ncount as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are not deemed present or represented by proxy at the\nSpecial Meeting, then a failure to vote will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal. If your shares are\ndeemed present or represented by proxy, then a failure to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Adjournment\nProposal only if a quorum is not present, and will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or, if a quorum is present, on the Adjournment\nProposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, if a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in street name does not\ngive voting instructions to the broker, bank\n18\nTable of Contents\nor other nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and will\nnot be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. However, if a beneficial owner of shares of\ncommon stock held in street name gives voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee with respect to at least one of the proposals, but\ngives no instruction as to one or more of the other proposals, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of\nestablishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to any proposal as to which instructions were given, and will\nnot be voted with respect to any other proposal. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to\nvote your shares.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nYou should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger\nAgreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other\nthings, the Merger and how it affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply\nenvelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that\nyour shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If you hold your shares in\n\u201cstreet name,\u201d please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you\nsell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision\nof a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies 1Life in writing of\nsuch special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you\nsell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. You will also lose the ability to exercise\nappraisal rights in connection with the Merger with respect to the transferred shares. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common\nstock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your\nproxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered,\nwith respect to those shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to\nyou by 1Life.\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of common stock held in\n\u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect\nto those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to\nvote your shares by following their instructions for voting. Because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your broker, bank\nor other nominee is not authorized to vote your shares on any proposal without instructions from you. You are also invited to attend the Special\nMeeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares virtually at the Special Meeting unless you have\nobtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, as the stockholder of record, authorizing you to vote your shares.\n19\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nIf my broker holds my shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will my broker vote my shares for me?\nA:\nNo. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special\nMeeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you\nvoted \u201cAGAINST\u201d adoption of the Merger Agreement and, only if a quorum is not present, the Adjournment Proposal, but will have no effect on\nthe Compensation Proposal or, if a quorum is present, the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust\nCompany, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) at the phone number on your proxy card\u037e or\n\u2022\nby attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting at the meeting.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common stock, and to\nconfirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the\ninstructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote\nelectronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be\nresponsible.\nEven if you plan to attend the Special Meeting virtually, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by proxy. If you are a\nrecord holder or if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock virtually at\nthe Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote virtually, your previous vote\nby proxy will not be counted.\nIf your shares are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by\ncompleting and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone.

Attending the Special Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously\nsubmitted proxy. You must specifically vote at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.\nIf you hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how\nto change your vote. You may also vote virtually at the Special Meeting if you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing the matters to be\nconsidered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of\ncommon stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way\nthat you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for\nor against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by\nyour properly signed proxy will be voted: (i) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (ii) \u201cFOR\u201d the Compensation Proposal\u037e and (iii) \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe Adjournment Proposal.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed\nproxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for\neach brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will\nreceive more than one proxy card.\nQ:\nMay I exercise dissenters\u2019 rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nYes.

        "Section Header": "Background of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe Board of Directors, together with 1Life senior management, and with the assistance of its outside advisors, frequently reviews 1Life\u2019s strategic and\nfinancial alternatives in light of developments in 1Life\u2019s business, the sectors in which it operates, and the economy and financial markets generally, as\nthey, individually and together, may affect 1Life\u2019s long-term strategic goals and plans, with the goal of enhancing stockholder value. As part of this\nprocess, members of 1Life\u2019s senior management have from time to time engaged in business development and strategic discussions with participants in\nthe healthcare industry and other market participants, all with the goal of enhancing value for stockholders, including by delivering the best possible\nservices to patients and customers. 1Life\u2019s strategic discussions have focused on, among other things, opportunities for strategic transactions,\nacquisitions, licensing transactions, commercial agreements and other financial and strategic alternatives for 1Life, including continuing as a standalone\ncompany. In connection with evaluating these possible strategic and other opportunities, from time to time the Board of Directors has periodically sought\nthe advice of outside legal counsel and financial advisors to evaluate these strategic opportunities, including Morgan Stanley. 1Life selected Morgan\nStanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of, and involvement in, recent\ntransactions in the industry in which 1Life operates and its knowledge of 1Life\u2019s business and affairs.\nIn the fall of 2021, 1Life senior management and the Board of Directors began, in the context of long-range capital planning, an assessment of 1Life\u2019s\nongoing operations and expansion plans, related cash flow projections, the impact of changes in capital markets, and the interplay between these factors\nand the availability and attractiveness for any potential future third party funding of 1Life.\nIn mid-October 2021, a financial advisor for a strategic party (\u201cParty A\u201d) called Amir Dan Rubin, Chief Executive Officer and President of 1Life, and\nindicated that Party A was interested in exploring a potential partnership or other strategic transaction with 1Life. Mr. Rubin and Party A\u2019s financial\nadvisor agreed to find a time for 1Life management and representatives of Party A to discuss their respective businesses at a future date.\nOn October 26, 2021, Mr. Rubin and Bjorn Thaler, Chief Financial Officer of 1Life, met with the Chief Financial Officer of Party A and Party A\u2019s financial\nadvisor, at which time Messrs. Rubin and Thaler provided a general overview of 1Life and its business, and the parties agreed to have future meetings to\ncontinue to explore whether a potential partnership or other strategic transaction between 1Life and Party A would be beneficial to the respective\ncompanies and their stockholders.\nOn November 15, 2021, the Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled meeting with 1Life senior management, during which Mr. Rubin provided a\nregular strategic update on 1Life, including a description of discussions with Party A. The Board of Directors agreed that 1Life management should\ncontinue exploratory discussions with Party A, along with other business opportunities that 1Life considers from time to time.\nOn November 16, 2021, 1Life and Party A entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate due diligence between the parties in connection with a\npotential partnership or other strategic transaction. The confidentiality agreement included a two year standstill provision with a customary exclusion\npermitting Party A to make proposals to 1Life privately and confidentially.\nOver the course of the next few months, members of 1Life senior management, representatives of Morgan Stanley, senior management of Party A and\nParty A\u2019s financial advisors engaged in a series of diligence meetings and preliminary discussions to explore a potential partnership or other strategic\ntransaction between the two\n32Table of Contents\ncompanies. 1Life\u2019s senior management provided the Board of Directors with periodic updates on these discussions. During this period, the companies\nand their financial advisors continued to discuss perspectives on structure and valuation, and 1Life management pointed representatives of Party A to\nthe financial forecasts made by 1Life and provided in 1Life\u2019s proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed on July\n6, 2021 (as amended on July 14, 2021, the \u201cForm S-4\u201d) as a basis for evaluating the future prospects of 1Life.\nOn January 31, 2022, a subset of independent directors of the Board of Directors consisting of Bruce W. Dunlevie, Robert R. Schmidt and Paul R. Auvil\n(the \u201cBoard subgroup\u201d) held a meeting with Messrs. Rubin and Thaler and Ms. Mango, General Counsel of 1Life. Members of 1Life senior management\nhad from time to time consulted with the Board subgroup regarding strategic transaction matters following 1Life\u2019s initial public offering, including in\nconnection with 1Life\u2019s acquisition of Iora Health, Inc., based on the constituent directors\u2019 independence, experience with strategic transactions, existing\nroles within the Board of Directors and willingness to serve in such roles.

Representatives from Cooley reviewed with the Board subgroup fiduciary duties attendant to any review\nof strategic alternatives. Discussion ensued regarding 1Life\u2019s commercial, strategic, and growth opportunities, including the timing and structure of a\npotential capital raise. The Board subgroup also discussed whether 1Life should conduct additional targeted outreach to third parties at that time that\nmight be interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction. The Board subgroup agreed that 1Life management should continue discussions with\nParty A and Amazon and continue exploring capital raising alternatives, and agreed that further consideration was warranted with respect to whether to\nconduct additional outreach to third parties that might be interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction.\nFrom April 1, 2022 until April 26, 2022, 1Life senior management continued to meet with representatives of Amazon to determine whether a potential\ncommercial partnership or other strategic transaction could be mutually beneficial.\nOn April 16, 2022, the Board subgroup and Mr. Kennedy held a meeting with 1Life senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley and\nCooley.

The Board of Directors determined that additional\noutreach should not be conducted at that time, due to the Board of Directors\u2019 belief that (i) the existing set of alternatives being explored were the\npotential opportunities most likely to be in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders, (ii) the other potential strategic parties to acquire 1Life would\nnot be viable counterparties based on historical interactions between representatives of 1Life and such parties, (iii) exploring additional alternatives at\nthat time was likely to present a significant risk of leak, and both such additional exploration and the result of any such leak presented a significant risk of\ndisruption to 1Life\u2019s business.\nOn April 24, 2022, 1Life entered into an amendment to an existing commercial non-disclosure agreement between 1Life and Amazon, which amendment\nincluded a nine-month standstill provision with a customary exclusion permitting Amazon to make proposals to 1Life privately and confidentially, and\nprovided that the standstill obligations automatically terminate following entrance by 1Life into a definitive agreement providing for a change of control\nof 1Life.\nOn April 26, 2022, Messrs. Rubin and Thaler met with Mr. Bertucci to communicate 1Life\u2019s valuation expectations for a potential strategic transaction.\nMessrs.

Mr. Bertucci indicated that Amazon would soon provide its view on a potential strategic transaction.\nOn April 27, 2022, Messrs. Rubin and Thaler met with Mr. Bertucci and another representative of Amazon.

In light of 1Life\u2019s other strategic\nalternatives, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Thaler communicated that in order to be competitive, Amazon would need to provide a proposal to 1Life expeditiously\nthat reflected a substantial premium to 1Life\u2019s then-current stock price, and that such transaction would need to be executed on an accelerated timeline.\nMr. Bertucci indicated that Amazon would need significantly more due diligence information in order to determine whether and at what valuation it could\nsubmit an offer, and requested access to 1Life\u2019s existing data room for Amazon in order to conduct such diligence.\nLater on June 16, 2022, Amazon was given access to 1Life\u2019s virtual data room.\nOn June 17, 2022, Mr. Rubin met with the Chief Financial Officer of Party A, who conveyed that Party A had concerns about the expedited timeline\npreviously agreed upon, and the two executives agreed to reconnect soon.\nOn June 18, 2022, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Goldman Sachs & Co.

Mr. Rubin replied that he would relay the offer to the Board of Directors but that $16.00 per share was unlikely to be compelling,\nand that a higher price would likely be required in order for the Board of Directors to authorize 1Life senior management and legal and financial advisors\nto negotiate definitive transaction documents with Amazon.

Mr. Bertucci said he would discuss with Amazon senior\nmanagement whether Amazon was able to provide an increased offer and would provide an update in the next few days.\nOver the next several days, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Bertucci had multiple telephone discussions concerning the potential strategic transaction.\nOn July 2, 2022, Mr. Bertucci called Mr. Rubin and informed him that, following discussions with Amazon senior management, Amazon was willing to offer\n$18.00 per share in cash to acquire 1Life (the \u201c$18.00 per share proposal\u201d), subject to additional confirmatory due diligence information.

The Board of Directors then discussed various\nmatters related to the transaction, including general market dynamics, the regulatory landscape, the lack of contact from other potential acquirers\nfollowing the July 5th media reports of rumors of a potential strategic transaction involving 1Life and the lack of further engagement from Party A, and\nthe belief of the Board of Directors that additional negotiation on price was highly unlikely to result in an increased offer from Amazon and instead could\nput the transaction at risk, including due to the risk of leak with ongoing discussions and the fact that Amazon stated that it would disengage if there\nwere any rumors or public speculation about its potential interest in such a strategic transaction. Following additional discussion, the Board\n39\nTable of Contents\nof Directors determined that it was in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders to continue to pursue a transaction with Amazon under the terms of\nAmazon\u2019s $18.00 per share proposal.

Morgan Stanley then reviewed with the Board of Directors its financial analysis of\nthe merger consideration and delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of\nthat date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion, the merger\nconsideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock of 1Life in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

After its review, the Board of Directors believed that $18.00 in cash,\nwithout interest thereon, per share of 1Life common stock represented the best value reasonably available for holders of common stock,\nwhile providing an opportunity, in certain circumstances, to consider an unsolicited Superior Proposal made after the announcement of the\nMerger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nCertainty of Value: the fact that the Merger Consideration of $18.00 in cash, without interest thereon, per share of 1Life common stock is\npayable solely in cash, which offers immediate liquidity and certain value to 1Life stockholders in respect of their shares of 1Life common\nstock, eliminating the risks and uncertainties inherent in 1Life continuing as a standalone company as described below, taking into account\n1Life\u2019s business, operations, prospects, strategic, short and long term operating plans, assets and properties, liabilities and financial\ncondition\u037e\n\u2022\nOpinion of Morgan Stanley: the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion to the\nBoard of Directors, to the effect that, as of July 20, 2022 (the date of the opinion) and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,\nprocedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set\nforth in Morgan Stanley\u2019s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of 1Life common stock issued\nand outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such holders of common stock, as more fully described below in the section captioned \u201cOpinion of Morgan\nStanley & Co. LLC.\u201d For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2013Opinion of Morgan\nStanley & Co.

For more information, please see the section of this\nproxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nPotential Strategic Alternatives: the Board of Directors determined that none of the possible alternatives to the Merger (including the\npossibility of continuing to operate 1Life as an independent company without a significant capital raise, pursuing a different strategic\ntransaction or pursuing a significant capital raise, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives, as well as the potential\nbenefits and risks to 1Life\u2019s stockholders of those alternatives, and the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives) was reasonably\nlikely to present superior opportunities for 1Life to create greater value for its stockholders taking into account execution risks as well as\nbusiness, competitive, financial, industry, legal, market and regulatory considerations.\n\u2022\nReview Process: the Board of Directors conducted a thorough process and considered 1Life\u2019s business, strategy, business plan, prospects\nand alternatives over an extended period, including that the Board of Directors met seven times in the seven week period from June 2, 2022\nand July 20, 2022, with 1Life\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors in attendance as needed\u037e\n\u2022\nInterim Debt Financing: the fact that under the Merger Agreement, 1Life has the ability to obtain senior unsecured interim debt financing\nfrom Amazon in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million to be funded in up to ten tranches of $30 million per month, beginning\non March 20, 2023 until the earlier of Closing and the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, with a maturity date of 24\nmonths after the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms\u037e\n\u2022\nLikelihood of Completion: the likelihood that the Closing of the Merger would be achieved under the terms of the Merger Agreement\nbased on:\n\u2022\nthe financial strength of Amazon and its ability to fund the Merger Consideration with cash available\u037e\n\u2022\nthe absence of any financing condition in the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe business reputation and capabilities of Amazon, including Amazon\u2019s track record of successfully completing merger and\nacquisition transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe commitment made by Amazon to 1Life to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval, including a commitment to\ndefend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any governmental authority or any other person under antitrust\nlaws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date.

stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement and who are entitled to and otherwise properly demand and exercise, and do not effectively waive, withdraw,\nfail to

of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares of 1Life common stock\n(exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on\nthe amount determined to be fair value, if any), which may be determined by the court to be more than, less than, or the same as the\nMerger Consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe initial outside date of July 20, 2023, with two six-month automatic extensions in certain circumstances as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement relating to the failure of antitrust clearances to be obtained, allowing for time that the Board of Directors believed to be\nsufficient to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that that, taken as a whole, the comprehensive terms of the Merger Agreement, including the respective representations,\nwarranties, covenants and termination rights and fees of the parties, as finally negotiated are reasonable and customary\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe fact the Board of Directors and 1Life\u2019s management, in coordination with 1Life\u2019s independent legal and financial advisors,\nnegotiated with Amazon on an arm\u2019s-length basis, including with respect to price and other terms and conditions of the Merger\nAgreement.\nThe Board of Directors also assessed 1Life\u2019s prospects for substantially increasing stockholder value as a standalone company in excess of the Merger\nConsideration, given the risks and uncertainties in 1Life\u2019s business, including the following (which are not listed in any relative order of importance):\n\u2022\nthe various execution and other risks to achieving 1Life\u2019s long-term operating plan and related uncertainties, including those described\nbelow\u037e\n44\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in operating 1Life\u2019s business in a heavily regulated and competitive industry that is closely scrutinized by federal, state\nand local authorities\u037e\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of the outcome of healthcare reform legislation, including regulations that could impact payments for medical services\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential regulatory scrutiny of 1Life\u2019s health network partnerships that could adversely impact 1Life\u2019s business and operations, and the\nrisks related to 1Life\u2019s reliance on third party relationships, including health network providers and enterprise clients, to continue to grow its\nbusiness\u037e\n\u2022\nthe changes in the nature or operations of 1Life\u2019s enterprise clients, including changes to employee benefit programs or workforce\nreductions in response to uncertain economic conditions, and the potential adverse impact on 1Life\u2019s ability to enroll new and retain\nexisting patients\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks related to 1Life\u2019s reliance on patient visits as a substantial portion of 1Life\u2019s net revenue\u037e\n\u2022\nthe changes in the health insurance industry, including the challenges associated with a potential shift away from employer-sponsored\nhealth plans toward employee self-insurance\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in managing the growth of a business that requires significant capital expenditures, such as

political and global trade tensions, and the current and potential impact of such factors in both the near term and\nlong term on the industry, all of which risks are increased by the COVID-19 pandemic and may remain present following the resolution of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Board of Directors also took into consideration that as a standalone company 1Life would need to seek significant additional funding through future\nequity and/or debt financings, and any such fundraising could have a highly dilutive effect on 1Life\u2019s existing stockholders, could require 1Life to enter\ninto restrictive covenants, might only be available on unfavorable terms given the recent downward trend in the financial markets, or might not be\navailable at all.\nThe Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following (which are not listed in any\nrelative order of importance):\n\u2022\nthe fact that 1Life would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and stockholders would no longer participate in any\nfuture earnings or growth and would not benefit from any potential future appreciation in value of 1Life\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the potential outside date is as late as July 22, 2024 (if extended) and the 1Life stockholders could be asked to vote on the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement well in advance of the completion of the Transactions\u037e\n45\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe risks and costs to 1Life if the Merger does not close or is not completed in a timely manner,

the proposed Merger and/or (C) the obligation to repay the interim debt financing could have on 1Life\u2019s cash balances and\nability to service payments under 1Life\u2019s outstanding convertible notes and other outstanding indebtedness at that time, and the fact that\n1Life\u2019s options for sources of financing or refinancing could be more limited than if 1Life had not pursued the proposed Merger, (ii) the\ndiversion of employee attention, (iii) the possible loss of key management or other personnel of 1Life during the pendency of the Merger,\n(iv) the impact with respect to potential and existing patients and other third parties that may seek to change or may not enter into business\nrelationships with 1Life during the pendency of the Merger, and (v) if the Merger does not close,

business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that 1Life conduct in\nall material respects its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,

Accordingly, the Board of Directors determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereby are advisable,\nfair to, and in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors\nconsidered by the Board of Directors in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated thereby, and making its recommendation\nand determination. The members of the Board of Directors evaluated the various factors listed above, among other things, in light of their knowledge of\nthe business, financial condition and prospects of 1Life and considered the advice of 1Life\u2019s independent financial and legal advisors. In view of the wide\nvariety of factors considered by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement, the Transactions and the complexity\nof these matters, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons\nconsidered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information and reasons described above, individual members of\nthe Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors.\nThe Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or\ndid not support its ultimate determinations. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented,\nincluding thorough discussions with, and questioning of, 1Life management, and its independent legal and financial advisors.\nWhen considering the foregoing recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,\nstockholders should be aware that some of 1Life\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition\nto, the interests of stockholders more generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent\nthat they existed at the time, in reaching the determination that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions were fair to and in the best interests of 1Life\nand its stockholders, in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the\nconsummation of the Transactions, in making its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and\napproval of the Transactions and in directing that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders.

However, in connection with evaluating a potential strategic transaction in March 2022,\n47\nTable of Contents\n1Life senior management created long range projections from 2022 through 2025 and extrapolations from 2026 through 2031 (the \u201cManagement Case A\u201d).\nIn addition, in connection with 1Life\u2019s evaluation of the acquisition of Iora Health, Inc. in the second quarter of 2021, 1Life senior management had\ncreated (i) standalone forecasts for 1Life that were long range projections from 2021 through 2023 and extrapolations from 2024 through 2030 (the \u201c1Life\nCase\u201d), (ii) standalone forecasts for Iora based on Iora management long range projections through 2025 and 1Life\u2019s management extrapolations through\n2030 and applying 1Life\u2019s assumptions and forecasts of Iora through 2030 (the \u201cIora Base Case\u201d), and (iii) prospective financial information with respect\nto the ability of the combined 1Life and Iora to increase its revenue and reduce its costs and capital expenditures following the consummation of the\nmerger between 1Life and Iora through 2030 (the \u201cIora Synergies\u201d), each of (i)-(iii) as set forth in 1Life\u2019s proxy statement/prospectus filed on Form S-4 on\nJuly 6, 2021 (as amended on July 14, 2021, the \u201cForm S-4\u201d). In connection with 1Life\u2019s evaluation of a potential strategic transaction, in March 2022, 1Life\nsenior management combined the 1Life Case, the Iora Base Case and the Iora Synergies (together, the \u201c2021 Projections\u201d), extrapolated such 2021\nProjections through 2031 and updated the 2021 Projections to include 1Life\u2019s actual net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and reflect 1Life\u2019s actual tax position\n(the 2021 Projections as so combined, extrapolated and updated, \u201cManagement Case B\u201d, and together with Management Case A, the \u201cProjections\u201d).\nManagement Case A, as compared to Management Case B, assumes lower investments in future growth beginning in 2024 due to the impact of the\ncurrent economic and financial environment. Management Case A assumed (i) revenue growth rates decrease from 75% in 2022 to 7% in 2031 (as\ncompared to Management Case B which assumes revenue growth rates decrease from 79% in 2022 to 23% in 2031)\u037e and (ii) care margins increase from\n20% in 2022 to 33% in 2031 (as compared to Management Case B which assumes care margins increase from 20% in 2022 to 31% in 2031). Both\nManagement Case A and Management Case B assume a standalone capital raise of $300,000,000 at the end of 2022.\nThe Projections reflect estimates and assumptions made by 1Life senior management with respect to general business, economic, competitive, regulatory\nand other market and financial conditions and other future events, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond 1Life\u2019s control. In\nparticular, the Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently\nuncertain. Because the Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are\nunlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance that could have an effect on 1Life\u2019s business and its results of operations. The Projections were\ndeveloped solely using the information available to 1Life senior management at the time they were created and reflect assumptions as to certain business\ndecisions that are subject to change. The Projections further reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple\ninterpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results and business developments. Important factors that may affect actual results or that may\nresult in the Projections not being achieved include, but are not limited to, regulatory actions at the federal, state and local level, decisions of health\nnetwork providers, enterprise clients and existing and potential patients, changes in the health insurance industry, the effect of global economic\nconditions, including COVID-19, and other factors described in the section captioned \u201cForward-looking Statements\u201d in this proxy statement and the risk\nfactors described in 1Life\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K. The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward compliance with published\nguidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of\nprospective financial information. The Projections cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon\nas such.\nNone of 1Life, the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley, Amazon or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any\nrepresentation to any stockholder regarding the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the Projections or the ultimate performance of\n1Life relative to the Projections. The inclusion of the summary of the Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or\nrepresentation of 1Life, the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley, Amazon or any of their respective\n48\nTable of Contents\naffiliates, advisors or other representatives that the Projections or the information contained therein are material. The inclusion of the summary of the\nProjections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that 1Life or anyone who receives the Projections then considered, or now\nconsiders, the Projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In the view of\n1Life\u2019s management, the Projections were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best estimates and judgments available to 1Life\u2019s management at\nthe time and presented, to the best of 1Life\u2019s management\u2019s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and 1Life\u2019s expected future financial\nperformance as of the date such information was prepared. Except as required by applicable law, neither 1Life, the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley,\nAmazon, nor any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update, correct\nor otherwise revise the Projections if any or all of them have changed or change. Since the Projections were created, 1Life has made publicly available its\nactual results of operations for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. You should review 1Life\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q\nfiled with the SEC on August 3, 2022 for this information. The Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of,\n1Life senior management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect\nto the accompanying Projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this document relates to the Company\u2019s previously issued financial\nstatements. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.\nIn light of the foregoing, and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the\nProjections. The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding 1Life in\nits public filings with the SEC. The Projections were developed by 1Life senior management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger\nand the other Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and therefore the Projections do not give effect to the proposed Merger or any\nchanges to 1Life\u2019s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the consummation of the Merger, including any costs incurred in connection with\nthe proposed Merger. Furthermore, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the proposed Merger to be completed and should\nnot be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.\nCare Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow (each as defined below) contained in the summary of the Projections set forth below are\neach \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are financial performance or operating measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These\nnon-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be calculated differently than similarly titled\nnon-GAAP financial measures published by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they\nexclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be\nconsidered together with, and not as alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in\nthe Projections were relied on by Morgan Stanley for the purposes of its fairness opinion and by the Board of Directors in connection with its\nconsideration of a potential strategic transaction. The SEC rules, which otherwise would require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the\nmost closely comparable GAAP financial measure, do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to a board of directors or financial advisors in\nconnection with a proposed business combination transaction, such as the Transactions, if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy\nstatement. In addition, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measures were not provided\nto or relied upon by the Board of Directors or Morgan Stanley in connection with the Transactions. Accordingly, 1Life has not provided reconciliations of\nthe non-GAAP financial measures included in the Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe information and tables set forth below is included solely to give 1Life stockholders access to certain of the financial and operating projections that\nwere made available to the Board of Directors and Morgan Stanley and are not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder\u2019s\ndecision to vote with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present a summary of the Projections:\nManagement Case A\n($ in millions)\nProjections\nExtrapolation\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\n2027E\n2028E\n2029E\n2030E\n2031E\nRevenue\n1,089\n1,686\n2,373\n2,909\n3,374\n3,864\n4,366\n4,868\n5,355\n5,730\nCare Margin(1)\n221\n353\n533\n729\n898\n1,086\n1,291\n1,504\n1,710\n1,891\nAdj.

LLC\n1Life retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d) to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential sale of 1Life and to provide\nfinancial advice and assistance and, upon the request of the 1Llife, to\n50\nTable of Contents\nrender a financial opinion in each case in connection therewith. 1Life selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nqualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in 1Life\u2019s industry. On July 20, 2022, Morgan Stanley\nrendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of that date, and based upon and\nsubject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by\nMorgan Stanley as set forth in Morgan Stanley\u2019s written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of 1Life\u2019s common\nstock (other than the Excluded Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of common stock.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board of Directors, dated July 20, 2022, is attached as Annex B and is\nincorporated by reference into this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion.\nStockholders of 1Life are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was directed to the Board of\nDirectors and addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of 1Life\u2019s common\nstock (other than the Excluded Shares). Morgan Stanley did not express any view on, and the opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the\nMerger Agreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into\nor amended in connection therewith. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives\navailable to 1Life, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion does not constitute an opinion or\nrecommendation as to how the stockholders of 1Life should vote at the Special Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger. The summary of\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of 1Life\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning 1Life\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of 1Life\u037e\n\u2022\ndiscussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of 1Life with senior executives of 1Life\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the reported prices and trading activity for 1Life\u2019s common stock\u037e\n\u2022\ncompared the financial performance of 1Life and the prices and trading activity of 1Life\u2019s common stock with that of certain other publicly-\ntraded companies comparable with 1Life and their securities\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nparticipated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of 1Life and Amazon and their financial and legal advisors\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information\nthat was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by 1Life, and formed a substantial basis for Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion. With respect\n51\nTable of Contents\nto the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of the management of 1Life of the future financial performance of 1Life. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion expressed no view as to such financial\nprojections or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with\nthe terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that\nAmazon will have sufficient immediately available funds to consummate the Merger. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all\nthe necessary or requested governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or\nrestrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Morgan Stanley\nis not a legal, tax, or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of\n1Life and its legal, tax, or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the\nfairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of 1Life\u2019s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the\nMerger Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock in the Merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or\nappraisal of the assets or liabilities of 1Life, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not\naddress the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives available to 1Life, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved\nor are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information\nmade available to Morgan Stanley as of July 20, 2022. Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and the assumptions used in\npreparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.\nSummary of Financial Analyses\nThe following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the preparation of its\nwritten opinion letter, dated as of July 20, 2022, to the Board of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nopinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses\ndescribed represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below\nmust be considered as a whole\u037e considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could\ncreate a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion.\nIn performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was directed by the Board of Directors\nto rely upon, among other matters, the Projections, which are more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cRecommendations of\nthe Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger \u2013 Financial Projections.\u201d In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley\nutilized the Projections in its financial analyses described below.\nPublic Trading Benchmarks Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a public trading benchmarks analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar\ncompanies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for 1Life with comparable publicly available\nconsensus equity analyst research estimates for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, that share similar\nbusiness characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue\ngrowth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (these companies are referred to herein as the\n\u201ccomparable companies\u201d).\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe comparable companies were split into two groups for the purposes of this analysis: (i) \u201cMedicare Advantage Focused Primary Care\u201d and (ii) \u201cTech-\nEnabled Healthcare Services.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue, using Wall Street research consensus estimates and publicly disclosed\ninformation for the comparable companies and 1Life. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley calculated \u201caggregate value\u201d as a company\u2019s fully\ndiluted equity value, per the treasury stock method and using the market price per share as of July 1, 2022 (the last day prior to media reports on a\npossible sale of 1Life) or July 19, 2022, plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents drawn from the most recently publicly reported figures for such\namounts. The trading multiples that were calculated using the market data as of July 1, 2022 are referred to as the \u201cunaffected multiples.\u201d The trading\nmultiples that were calculated using the market data as of July 19, 2022 are referred to as the \u201cJuly 19 multiples.\u201d The July 19 multiples were calculated for\nreference only, and were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s fairness analysis with respect to its opinion, due to Morgan Stanley\u2019s determination,\nusing its professional judgement and experience, that media reports of potential acquisitions in the sector affected trading outcomes for 1Life and the\ncomparable companies after July 1. The July 19 multiples are described more fully in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cOpinion of Morgan\nStanley & Co. LLC\u2013Other Information\u2013Public Trading Benchmarks\u2013July 19 Multiples.\u201d\nThe unaffected multiples represented by the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for 1Life, the \u201cMedicare\nAdvantage Focused Primary Care\u201d comparable companies and the \u201cTech-Enabled Healthcare Services\u201d comparable companies are set forth below:\nCY2022E\nA\nV\n/Estimated\nRevenue\nUnaffected\nMultiple\nCY2023E\nA\nV\n/Estimated\nRevenue\nUnaffected\nMultiple\n1Life\n1.5x\n1.2x\nMedicare Advantage Focused Primary Care\nOak Street Health, Inc.\n2.3x\n1.6x\nCano Health, Inc.\n1.2x\n1.0x\nCaremax, Inc.\n1.0x\n0.6x\nTech-Enabled Healthcare Services\nAgilon Health, Inc.\n3.4x\n2.3x\nTeladoc Health, Inc.\n2.7x\n2.2x\nLifeStance Health, Inc.\n2.5x\n2.0x\nAmerican Well Corp.

Morgan Stanley then applied these ranges of\nmultiples to the estimated relevant revenue metric for 1Life to calculate a range of implied aggregate values. Morgan Stanley then added the net cash of\n1Life, as provided by the management of 1Life, from this range of aggregate values to obtain a range of implied equity values. Morgan Stanley then\ndivided the range of implied equity values by the number of outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis as of July 19, 2022, as provided\nby the management of 1Life, to obtain a range of implied values per share, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, as set forth below:\n53\nTable of Contents\nAV/\nEstimated\nRevenue\nMultiple\nRanges\nImplied Value Per\nShare of 1Life\nCommon\nStock ($)\nCY 2022E AV / Revenue\nManagement Case A\n1.5x \u2013 2.5x\n7.75 \u2013 12.75\nManagement Case B\n1.5x \u2013 2.5x\n8.00 \u2013 13.00\nCY 2023E AV / Revenue\nManagement Case A\n1.0x \u2013 2.0x\n8.00\u2013 15.75\nManagement Case B\n1.0x \u2013 2.0x\n7.50 \u2013 14.50\nNo company utilized in this analysis is identical to 1Life. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with\nrespect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond\n1Life\u2019s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on 1Life\u2019s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the\nabsence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of 1Life and the industry, and in the financial markets in general.\nMathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.\nDiscounted Equity Value Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis for Management Case A and Management Case B, which is designed to provide insight\ninto the potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company\u2019s estimated future financial performance. The resulting future equity\nvalue is subsequently discounted at a rate based upon 1Life\u2019s cost of equity in order to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value. In connection\nwith this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of 1Life\u2019s common stock on a standalone basis for\nManagement Case A and Management Case B.\nTo calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized the revenue estimates from Management Case A and Management\nCase B for the next 12 months from year-end 2024. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley then applied\na range of next twelve month (\u201cNTM\u201d) multiples of 1.50x-2.50x to this revenue estimate to determine a range of implied aggregate values of 1Life as of\nyear-end 2024. Morgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied equity values as of such date by reducing the range of aggregate values by the\nestimated net debt of 1Life as of such date, as provided by the management of 1Life, assuming a future projected common equity issuance, per the\ndirection of the management of 1Life. Morgan Stanley then divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully diluted common shares as\nof such date, as provided by the management of 1Life, including the dilutive impact resulting from a future projected common equity issuance, to derive a\nrange of implied values per share as of such date. Morgan Stanley then discounted this range of per share values to June 30, 2022, at a discount rate of\n14.8%, which rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on 1Life\u2019s estimated cost of equity (estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and\nbased on its professional judgement and experience) to determine a range of implied discounted equity values per share, each rounded to the nearest\n$0.25, as set forth below:\nSelected AV /\nNTM Estimated\nRevenue\nMultiple\nRange\nImplied Discounted\nValue Per Share of\n1Life Common\nStock ($)\nEstimated NTM Revenue as of year-end 2024\nManagement Case A\n1.5x \u2013 2.5x\n12.50 \u2013 21.50\nManagement Case B\n1.5x \u2013 2.5x\n11.25 \u2013 19.50\n54\nTable of Contents\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nMorgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis for Management Case A and Management Case B, which is designed to provide an implied\nvalue of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a\nrange of fully diluted equity values per share as of June 30, 2022 based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from\nManagement Case A and Management Case B for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.\nMorgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows projected to be generated by 1Life based on estimates in each of Management\nCase A and Management Case B. These unlevered free cash flows were calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less\n(1) a portion of stock-based compensation expense, per the direction of the management of 1Life, (2) taxes (assuming effective rate of 25.0% offset by\nfederal and state net operating losses, as provided by the management of 1Life), (3) capital expenditures and (4) plus or minus changes in net working\ncapital, which such estimated unlevered free cash flow, in each case, was reviewed and approved by the management of 1Life for Morgan Stanley\u2019s use.\nTerminal values were calculated using a perpetual growth rate ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%, with such rates selected upon the application of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience. The unlevered free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to present values as of June 30, 2022,\nusing a midyear convention, at a discount rate ranging from 12.9% to 14.0%, which discount rates were selected upon the application of Morgan\nStanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of 1Life\u2019s weighted average cost of capital determined by the application of the\ncapital asset pricing model. The resulting range of implied aggregate values were then increased by the net cash of 1Life as of June 30, 2022, as provided\nby the management of 1Life, and the present value of a future projected common equity issuance, per the direction of the management of 1Life, to derive a\nrange of implied equity values. Morgan Stanley then divided the implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares, as of July 19, 2020 as\nprovided by the management of 1Life, including the dilutive impact resulting from a future projected common equity issuance, to derive a range of implied\nvalues per share, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, as set forth below:\nImplied Discounted\nValue Per\nShare of 1Life\nCommon\nStock ($)\nManagement Case A\n11.75 \u2013 15.00\nManagement Case B\n17.00 \u2013 21.50\nPrecedent Transactions \u2013 Premiums Paid Analysis\nMorgan Stanley considered, based on publicly available transaction information, transactions with global public targets larger than $1 billion in aggregate\nvalue, paid in all-cash consideration, since 1996 and announced on or before June 30, 2022. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted (i) the\ndistribution of the mean of percentage premiums paid over unaffected stock price, which was defined as the stock price four weeks prior to the earliest\ndate of the deal announcement, announcement of a competing bid, and market rumors and (ii) the annual mean of percentage premiums paid over\nunaffected stock price, which was defined as stock price four weeks prior to the earliest date of the deal announcement, announcement of a competing\nbid, and market rumors. Morgan Stanley noted a 27-year average premium of 40.1%.\nBased on its analysis of the premia for these transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley\nselected a representative range of premia of 40.0%-80.0% and applied such range to 1Life\u2019s closing share price on July 1, 2022, the last day prior to media\nreports on a possible sale of 1Life, which resulted in an implied price range per share of $11.59 to $14.90.\nNo company or transaction utilized in the premiums paid analysis is identical to 1Life or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan\nStanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry\n55\nTable of Contents\nperformance, general business, market and financial conditions and other factors beyond the control of 1Life, such as the impact of competition on the\nbusiness of 1Life or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition of 1Life or the\nindustry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and equity value of\nthe transactions to which they are being compared. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean and median) is not in itself a meaningful method\nof using precedent transaction data.\nOther Information\nMorgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis with respect to its opinion, but which\nwere noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described in the section of this proxy statement captioned\n\u201cOpinion of Morgan Stanley & Co.

The July 19 multiples were not considered part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial analysis with respect to its opinion due\nto Morgan Stanley\u2019s determination, using its professional judgement and experience, that media reports of potential acquisitions in the sector affected\ntrading outcomes for 1Life and the comparable companies after July 1.\nThe July 19 multiples represented by the ratio of aggregate value to estimated revenue for calendar years 2022 and 2023 for 1Life, the \u201cMedicare\nAdvantage Focused Primary Care\u201d comparable companies and the \u201cTech-Enabled Healthcare Services\u201d comparable companies are set forth below:\nCY2022E\nA\nV\n/Estimated\nRevenue\nJuly 19\nMultiple\nCY2023E\nA\nV\n/Estimated\nRevenue\nJuly 19\nMultiple\n1Life\n1.8x\n1.4x\nMedicare Advantage Focused Primary Care\nOak Street Health, Inc.\n3.0x\n2.1x\nCano Health, Inc.\n1.5x\n1.1x\nCaremax, Inc.\n1.4x\n0.9x\nTech-Enabled Healthcare Services\nAgilon Health, Inc.\n4.0x\n2.7x\nTeladoc Health, Inc.\n3.1x\n2.6x\nLifeStance Health, Inc.\n2.9x\n2.2x\nAmerican Well Corp.

Morgan Stanley also reviewed the trading range of 1Life\u2019s common stock for\nthe 30- and 60- day periods ending July 1, 2022, the last day prior to media reports on a possible sale of 1Life, and noted a volume-weighted average price\nper share of $8.38 and $8.25, respectively.\nBroker Price Targets\nFor reference only, and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed and analyzed future public market trading price targets for\n1Life\u2019s common stock that were prepared and published by equity research analysts on or before July 1, 2022, the last day prior to media reports on a\npossible sale of 1Life. These one-year forward targets reflected each analyst\u2019s estimate of the future public market trading price of 1Life\u2019s common stock.\nThe range of undiscounted analyst price targets was $9.00 to $17.00 per share of common stock as of July 1, 2022. Morgan Stanley discounted the range\nof analyst price targets by 12 months, at a discount rate of 14.8%, which rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on 1Life\u2019s estimated cost of equity\n(estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and based on Morgan Stanley\u2019s professional judgment and experience), to arrive at an implied\nrange of equity values, each rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $7.75 to $14.75 per share of common stock as of July 1, 2022.\nThe public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for 1Life common\nstock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of 1Life and future financial market conditions.\nGeneral\nIn connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for\npurposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or\nsummary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a\nwhole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various\nanalyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other\nassumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nview of the actual value of 1Life.\nIn performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic,\nmarket and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of 1Life. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on\nthe business of 1Life and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and\nprospects of 1Life and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley\u2019s analyses are not necessarily\nindicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.\nMorgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger\nConsideration to be received by the holders of common stock (other than the Excluded Shares), and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to the\nBoard of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which common stock might actually trade.\nThe value of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of common stock was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between 1Life\nand Amazon and was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to 1Life during these negotiations but did not,\nhowever, recommend\n57\nTable of Contents\nany specific consideration to 1Life or the Board of Directors, nor opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for\nthe Merger. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternatives available to 1Life, or\nwhether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion\nor a recommendation as to how stockholders of 1Life should vote at the Special Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors in\ndeciding to approve the execution, delivery and performance by 1Life of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Consequently, the analyses as described\nabove should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the Merger Consideration or of whether the Board\nof Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. Morgan Stanley\u2019s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley\ninvestment banking and other professionals in accordance with its customary practice.\n1Life retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley\u2019s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm\nengaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities\nunderwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment\nbanking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or\nmanage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own\naccount or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Amazon, 1Life, or any other company, or any currency or commodity,\nthat may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.\nUnder the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided 1Life financial advisory services and the Board of Directors with a fairness opinion,\ndescribed in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and 1Life has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a\nfee of approximately $49 million for its services, $4 million of which was paid following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to\nthis proxy statement as Annex B and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. 1Life has also agreed to reimburse\nMorgan Stanley for its reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket fees of outside counsel and\nother professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, 1Life has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its\nand their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against\ncertain losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley\u2019s engagement, including certain\nliabilities under the federal securities laws, including arising out of or in connection with litigation and other actions relating to Morgan Stanley\u2019s\nengagement.\nDuring the two years preceding the date of delivery of Morgan Stanley\u2019s written opinion, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates provided financing services to\nAmazon and have received fees of approximately $5-15 million in connection with such services, and financial advisory and financing services to 1Life\nand have received fees of approximately $20-40 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley is currently a lender to Amazon, unrelated to\nthe Merger. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to Amazon.com, 1Life and their respective affiliates in the\nfuture and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.\nInterests of 1Life\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be\naware that some of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of\nstockholders more generally, as\n58\nTable of Contents\nmore fully described below. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, to the extent that they existed at\nthe time, in reaching the determination that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions were fair to and in the best interests of 1Life and its stockholders,\nin reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the\nTransactions, in making their recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the\nTransactions and in directing that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the stockholders.

In addition, upon an involuntary termination without cause or resignation for\ngood reason in connection at or within twelve months following a Change of Control (as defined in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan\nand which includes the Merger), participants will be entitled to receive (i) a cash payment equal to twelve months\u2019 base salary payable in monthly\ninstallments in accordance with our regular payroll schedule, (ii) a cash payment for the participant\u2019s full performance-based incentive at the participant\u2019s\ntarget achievement level for the applicable year under the 1Life Executive Annual Incentive Plan, (iii) continuation of health insurance under COBRA for\nup to twelve months following such resignation or termination date, and (iv) acceleration of all equity awards outstanding on the resignation or\ntermination date. All such severance benefits are subject to the participant\u2019s execution and nonrevocation of a general release of all known and unknown\nclaims in favor of 1Life or its acquirer or successor in substantially the form provided in the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan.\nThe benefits provided under the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan supersede any similar severance benefits described in a participant\u2019s\noffer letter or employment agreement (other than for Mr. Rubin, as noted below).\nFor the purposes of the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, \u201ccause\u201d generally means termination of a participant\u2019s service for one or more\nof the following reasons: (1) the participant\u2019s indictment or\n62Table of Contents\nconviction of any felony or any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state thereof\u037e (2) the\nparticipant\u2019s refusal to abide by or comply with any reasonable, lawful directives of the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors\u037e (3) the\nparticipant\u2019s willful dishonesty, fraud, or material misconduct with respect to the business or affairs of 1Life or its acquiror or successor in interest\u037e (4)\nintentional, material violation of any contract or agreement with 1Life or of any statutory duty owed to 1Life or its acquiror or successor\u037e or (5) the\nparticipant\u2019s conduct by which the participant demonstrates gross unfitness to serve.\n\u201cGood Reason\u201d shall mean if one of the following events occurs without the participant\u2019s written consent: (i) a material reduction in the amount of\naggregate cash compensation which the participant has the opportunity to earn, or failure by 1Life to pay such compensation\u037e (ii) the participant is\nrequired by 1Life to relocate the participant\u2019s primary work location by more than 25 miles\u037e (iii) a material adverse reduction in the participant\u2019s duties,\nauthority or responsibilities, including the participant\u2019s reporting responsibilities, but excluding any change in title that does not represent a material\nadverse reduction in the participant\u2019s duties, authority or responsibilities as existed immediately prior to such change in title and (iv) a material breach by\n1Life under any written agreement between the participant and 1Life.\nFor purposes of clause (iii) above, for all other officers, if 1Life is operated as a separate subsidiary or business unit following a Change of Control, such\nofficers will be deemed to have suffered a material reduction in duties, authority or responsibilities if such duties, authority or responsibilities, including\nreporting responsibilities, with respect to such subsidiary or separate business unit are materially changed following such Change of Control. In order to\neffect a Resignation for Good Reason, the participant must notify the Board of Directors within 30 days after the first occurrence of the event described\nabove, 1Life must fail to cure such event within 30 days after receiving written notice, and the participant\u2019s resignation date must be no later than 60 days\nafter the expiration of 1Life\u2019s cure period.

The letter agreement with Amazon also provides that, effective\nas of the Closing Date, the Rubin Employment Agreement is amended such that Mr. Rubin waives any right he may have to receive severance benefits\nupon a termination of his employment on or following the Closing Date for Good Reason (as defined in the Rubin Employment Agreement). For more\ninformation, see the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Interests of 1Life\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\u2014\nArrangements with Amazon.\u201d\nRetention Award RSU Grants\nOur Compensation Committee has approved, and we have granted, the following retention awards in consultation with Amazon: (i) on August 8, 2022, we\ngranted retention awards in the form of 1Life RSUs to our current named executive officers (other than Mr. Rubin), and (ii) on August 12, 2022, we granted\na retention award in the form of 1Life RSUs to Mr. Rubin (collectively with the retention awards granted to the other named executive officers, the\n\u201cRetention 1Life RSUs\u201d). The grants had the following grant date values: $10,000,000 for Mr. Rubin\u037e $4,000,000 for Mr. Thaler\u037e $2,000,000 for Mr. Diamond\nand $4,000,000 for Ms. Mango, resulting in 583,090 shares of common stock underlying the RSUs for Mr. Rubin, 237,529 shares of common stock\nunderlying the RSUs for Mr. Thaler, 118,764 shares of common stock underlying the RSUs for Mr. Diamond and 237,529 shares of common stock\nunderlying the RSUs for Ms. Mango. Such Retention 1Life RSUs will vest based on continued service over four (4) years, with fifty percent (50%) of the\nshares subject to the Retention 1Life RSUs vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date, twenty percent (20%) vesting on the second anniversary of\nthe grant date, fifteen percent (15%) on the third anniversary of the grant date and fifteen percent (15%) vesting on the fourth anniversary of the grant. In\nthe case of the Retention 1Life RSUs granted to our current named executive officers (other than Mr. Rubin), at the Effective Time, such Retention 1Life\nRSUs will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the (1) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (2) the number of shares then\nsubject to such Retention 1Life RSU on the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) at the Effective Time. Each such cash award will\nvest in full upon a \u201cQualifying Termination,\u201d which includes a termination without \u201cCause\u201d and a resignation for Good Reason (each as defined in the\nExecutive Severance and Change in Control Plan, except that for this specific grant only changes in employee roles and reporting chain naturally resulting\nfrom the consummation of the proposed transaction would not automatically give rise to \u201cGood Reason\u201d) at any time on or after the Closing Date, as\ndescribed further in the section of this proxy statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Payments Upon Termination at or Following Change in Control.\u2019\u2019 In the\ncase of the Retention 1Life RSUs granted to Mr. Rubin, any 1Life RSUs that remain unvested as of the Closing Date will be forfeited for no consideration\nin accordance with Mr. Rubin\u2019s letter agreement with Amazon. Any vested Retention 1Life RSUs granted to Mr. Rubin will be treated as other vested\n1Life RSUs at the Closing Date and will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the (1) the Merger Consideration,\nmultiplied by (2) the number of shares then subject to such Retention 1Life RSUs, less any applicable tax withholdings. In addition, Mr. Rubin\u2019s Retention\n1Life RSUs will accelerate and vest in full in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date by Amazon.\nQuantification of Potential Payments to Certain 1Life Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger that will\nor may become payable to 1Life\u2019s named executive officers in\n64\nTable of Contents\nconnection with the Merger.

We expect certain of our non-employee directors and named executive officers will continue\nadopting such plans in the ordinary course, and selling shares pursuant to adopted plans, prior to the Effective Time. Any such plans may cover a significant\nportion of the applicable non-employee director\u2019s or named executive officer\u2019s holdings of our common stock.\nAppraisal Rights\nIf the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders of 1Life (i) who continuously hold shares of 1Life common stock through the\neffective date of the Merger, (ii) who did not vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (iii) who are entitled to demand appraisal\nrights under Section 262 of the DGCL, (iv) who otherwise properly comply with the applicable requirements and procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL\u037e\nand (v) who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of such shares, fail to perfect or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in\naccordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to demand appraisal of their shares and receive, if the Merger is successful and the Merger is\nconsummated, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares (as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any), as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their shares could be more than, the same as\nor less than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration\npayable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any\nstockholder contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should review carefully the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, particularly the\nprocedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights.\nThe following is a summary of the procedures to be followed by stockholders who wish to exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the\nDGCL. A copy of the full text of the version of Section 262 of the DGCL applicable to the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy as Annex C. This\nsummary does not purport to be a complete statement of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, Section 262 of the DGCL. All references in\nSection 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a \u201cstockholder\u201d are to the record holder of shares as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person\nholding a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the\nstockholder of record to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Failure to timely and fully\ncomply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders should\nassume that 1Life will take no action to perfect any appraisal rights of any stockholder.\nAny stockholder who desires to exercise his, her or its appraisal rights should review carefully Section 262 of the DGCL and is urged to consult his,\nher or its legal advisor before electing or attempting to exercise such rights. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor\ndoes it constitute a recommendation that 1Life stockholders exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of the stockholders, the corporation, not less than\ntwenty (20) days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of the stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to\nshares for which appraisal rights are available under Section 262 of the DGCL that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series\nof stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement constitutes the\nformal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and the required copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement\nas Annex C.\n69\nTable of Contents\nAny stockholder who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should review the following\ndiscussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified may result in the loss of appraisal rights\nunder the DGCL.\nIf a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the following:\n\u2022\ndeliver to 1Life a written demand for appraisal of your shares of 1Life common stock prior to the taking of the vote to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, which written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to\ndemand appraisal of his, her or its shares. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote\nabstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d or failing to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the\nMerger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL\u037e\n\u2022\nnot vote, or abstain from voting, his, her or its shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\ncontinuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made through the effective date of the\nMerger\u037e and\n\u2022\ncomply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights thereafter, including the requirement that the\nsurviving corporation or a stockholder who has validly demanded appraisal of his, her or its shares file a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery requesting a determination of the fair value of all such stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock within 120 days after the effective\ndate of the Merger.\nWithin ten (10) days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will provide notice of the effective date of the Merger to those\nstockholders of 1Life who have properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to the first bullet above, as required by Section 262 of the DGCL,\nhas not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and has not withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal. If the Merger is\nconsummated, a failure to make a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above (or to take any of the\nother steps specified in the above bullets) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your appraisal rights. At any time within sixty (60) days after\nthe effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that\nproceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the Merger Consideration, specified by the Merger Agreement for his,\nher or its shares. Any attempt to withdraw made more than sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger will require the written approval of the\nSurviving Corporation and no appraisal proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be dismissed without the approval\nof the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however,\nthat this provision will not affect the right of any stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger within sixty\n(60) days after the effective date of the Merger. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a stockholder\u2019s request to withdraw a demand for appraisal\nwhen the approval is required or if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder would be\nentitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value could be higher or lower than, or the same as, the\nvalue of the Merger Consideration.\nWritten Demand by the Stockholder\nAll written demands for appraisal should be addressed to 1Life Healthcare, Inc., One Embarcadero Center, Suite 1900, San Francisco, CA 94111. Attention:\nCorporate Secretary. The demand for appraisal must be\n70\nTable of Contents\nexecuted by or for the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder\u2019s name appears on the stockholder\u2019s shares (whether in book entry\nor on physical certificates). If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be\nmade in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be\nmade by or for all owners of record. An authorized agent, including one or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of\nrecord, but such agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose in such demand that the agent is acting as agent for the record\nowner or owners of such shares.\nA beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a\ntimely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the stockholder of record. If shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee who in turn holds\nthe shares through a central securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of\nthe depository nominee, and must identify the depository nominee as the stockholder of record. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the stockholder of record.\nThe beneficial holder of the shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the stockholder of record of the\nshares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.\nA record stockholder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee for several beneficial owners may\nexercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares held\nfor other beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand for appraisal must set forth the number of shares covered by such demand. Unless a\ndemand for appraisal specifies a number of shares, such demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of such stockholder.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and\nis entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of\nChancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal rights who did not vote their shares in\nfavor of the Merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for\nall stockholders who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. None of Amazon, Merger Sub or 1Life, as the Surviving Corporation, has any\nobligation to or has any present intention to file a petition and stockholders should not assume that any of the foregoing parties will file a petition or will\ninitiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the stockholders to initiate all necessary action to\nperfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and the requirements for exercise\nof appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of\nshares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which 1Life has received demands for appraisal, and the\naggregate number of stockholders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within ten (10) days after a written request therefor has been received\nby the Surviving Corporation or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record owner of the shares, a person who is\nthe beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been properly made\nand not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person\u2019s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement\ndescribed in this paragraph.\n71\nTable of Contents\nIf a petition for appraisal is duly filed by any stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation\nwill then be obligated within twenty (20) days after receiving service of a copy of the petition to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly\nverified list (the \u201cVerified List\u201d) containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares (the \u201cDissenting\nStockholders\u201d) and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares has not been reached. Upon the filing of a petition by a Dissenting Stockholder,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery may order a hearing and that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition will be mailed to the\nSurviving Corporation and all the Dissenting Stockholders shown on the Verified List. Notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of\nthe hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication deemed advisable by the\nDelaware Court of Chancery. The costs relating to these notices will be borne by the Surviving Corporation.\nIf a hearing on the petition is held, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to determine which Dissenting Stockholders have complied with the\nprovisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and are entitled to an appraisal of their shares. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require that Dissenting\nStockholders submit their share certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal\nproceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to dismiss the proceedings as to any Dissenting Stockholder who does not comply with\nsuch requirement. Accordingly, Dissenting Stockholders are cautioned to retain their share certificates after the Effective Time and thereafter comply with\nall orders of the Delaware Court of Chancery in respect of such certificates. In addition, assuming the shares remain listed on a national securities\nexchange immediately before the Effective Time, which we expect to be the case, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to dismiss the appraisal\nproceedings as to all Dissenting Stockholders unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding\nshares eligible for appraisal or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance\nwith the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through the appraisal proceeding,\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of\nChancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the\njudgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which\ncase interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid by the Surviving Corporation and the fair\nvalue of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that\ntime.\nIn determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of\nDelaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered, and\nthat \u201cfair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in\nmaking this determination of fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the\nnature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of\n72\nTable of Contents\nfuture value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of\nspeculation, may be considered.\u201d Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow\nexclusion that does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in\na merger is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. You should be aware that the fair value of your shares as determined under\nSection 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the\nterms of the Merger Agreement.\nUpon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder\nwhose name appears on the Verified List and who has submitted such stockholder\u2019s stock certificates, if any, to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if\nsuch is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. When the fair\nvalue of the shares is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders\nentitled thereto, forthwith in the case of holders of uncertificated stock or upon surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such shares\nin the case of certificated stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be\nenforced. The Delaware Court of Chancery may also (i) determine the costs of the proceeding (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) and tax such costs upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable and (ii) upon application of a stockholder,\norder all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any Dissenting Stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,\nreasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence\nof such an order, each party bears its own expenses. Determinations by the Delaware Court of Chancery are subject to appellate review by the Delaware\nSupreme Court.\nStockholders considering whether to seek appraisal should bear in mind that the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 of the DGCL\ncould be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration to be paid in the Merger. Although 1Life believes that the Merger\nConsideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Neither\nAmazon nor 1Life anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any Dissenting Stockholder, and each of Amazon and 1Life reserve the\nright to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares is less than the Merger\nConsideration.\nThe process of exercising appraisal rights requires compliance with technical prerequisites. Stockholders wishing to exercise their appraisal rights should\nconsult with their own legal counsel in connection with compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL.\nAny stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective date of\nthe Merger, be entitled to vote his, her or its shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions thereon, except\ndividends or other distributions payable to stockholders as of a date prior to the Effective Time.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such stockholder\u2019s\nright to appraisal, such stockholder\u2019s shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger\nConsideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days\nafter the effective date of the Merger. Inasmuch as 1Life has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so, any stockholder\nwho desires such a petition is advised to file it on a timely\n73\nTable of Contents\nbasis. In addition, a stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its\ndemand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to 1Life a written withdrawal of such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and acceptance of the terms of the Merger either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger or\nthereafter with the written approval of 1Life. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed\nas to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery deems just\u037e provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not\ncommenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the\nMerger Consideration within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.`\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nThe foregoing summary of the rights of the stockholders of 1Life to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not purport to be a complete statement\nof the procedures to be followed by the stockholders of 1Life desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. You\nshould also be aware that Section 262 of the DGCL was amended after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the date of this proxy statement.\nHowever, those amendments by their terms do not apply to merger agreements entered into before August 1, 2022, such as the Merger Agreement.\nAccordingly, the version of Section 262 of the DGCL in effect immediately prior to the 2022 statutory amendments is the version of Section 262 of the\nDGCL applicable to the Merger Agreement. A copy of the version of Section 262 of the DGCL applicable to the Merger Agreement is included as Annex C\nto this proxy statement.",

The effects\nof other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is\nbased upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Department regulations promulgated under the Code (the \u201cTreasury\nRegulations\u201d), court decisions, published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and other applicable\nauthorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with\nretroactive effect. This discussion is limited to stockholders who hold their shares of common stock as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section\n1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).\nThis discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their\nparticular circumstances.

Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors\nregarding the consequences of the Merger.\nWe have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following\nsummary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS\nin the event of litigation.\nTHE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX PLANNING. WE URGE YOU TO\nCONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nMERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX\nCONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\n75\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is (or is treated as) a citizen or resident of the U.S\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or any state thereof or the\nDistrict of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and the control of one or more U.S. persons as defined in\nSection 7701(a)(30) of the Code\u037e or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.\nperson.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of common stock that is not a U.S. Holder nor an entity classified as a\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nU.S. Holders\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder\u2019s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder\nand the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of\nshares (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). A U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S.\nHolder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in\nsuch shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers, including individuals,\nare currently taxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nAny gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax\ntreaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), in which case such gain\ngenerally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. Holders, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation,\nsuch gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax\ntreaty)\u037e or\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the Merger, and certain other\nrequirements are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%), which gain may be\noffset by certain U.S. source capital losses of such Non-U.S. Holder if the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns\nwith respect to such losses.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nInformation reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may apply to the proceeds received by a stockholder\npursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and\ncertifies that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a\nsubstitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a certification of such stockholder\u2019s foreign status on the appropriate series of\nIRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or\n76\nTable of Contents\n(ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the stockholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nWithholding on Foreign Entities\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly known as\n\u201cFATCA\u201d), impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d (as specially\ndefined under these rules) unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and\nprovide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and\ndebt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or an exemption applies. FATCA also\ngenerally will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) on certain payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity\nprovides the withholding agent with either a certification that it does not have any substantial direct or indirect U.S. owners or provides information\nregarding substantial direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and an applicable foreign country\nmay modify these requirements. FATCA withholding currently applies to payments of dividends. The Treasury Department has released proposed\nregulations which, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the federal withholding tax of thirty percent (30%) applicable to the gross proceeds of\na sale or other disposition of our common stock. In its preamble to such proposed regulations, the Treasury Department stated that taxpayers may\ngenerally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.\nStockholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on the disposition of common stock\npursuant to the Merger.\nRegulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nUnder the HSR Act, certain acquisitions may not be completed until information has been furnished to the DOJ and the FTC, and the applicable HSR Act\nwaiting period requirements have been satisfied. The waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the Merger is thirty (30) calendar days, unless the\nwaiting period is terminated earlier or extended. If the DOJ or FTC issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer\nto as a \u201cSecond Request\u201d), the parties must observe a second thirty (30)-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have\nsubstantially complied with such Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties agree with the DOJ or FTC to delay\nconsummation of the Merger for a specified period of time.\nThe Merger is subject to the provisions of the HSR Act and therefore cannot be completed until each of 1Life and Amazon file a notification and report\nform with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated and any voluntary agreement with\nthe DOJ or FTC not to consummate the Transactions has expired or been terminated.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the DOJ\nor the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties, requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or\nterminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other remedies. At any time before or after the completion of the\nMerger, and notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or foreign jurisdiction could take such\naction under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the\nMerger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of one or both of the parties,\n77\nTable of Contents\nrequiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or requiring the parties to agree to other\nremedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances, including by seeking to intervene in the\nregulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining\nrequired regulatory approvals. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and\napprovals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of\nadditional conditions, restrictions, qualifications, requirements or limitations on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets,\nlicense or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights, or agree to other remedies, or require changes to the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, or that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or if such challenge is made, what the result will be. These\nconditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain\nall of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the\napproval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\n1Life and Amazon have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Merger Agreement.",

        "Section Text": "PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nThe following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and\nelsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached\nto this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger\nAgreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger\nAgreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by\nthis summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (i) were made only for purposes of\nthe Merger Agreement and as of specific dates\u037e (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement\u037e and (iii) may be subject to\nimportant qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the\nterms of the Merger Agreement and contained in the confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, the representations and warranties have been\nincluded in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub rather than to establish\nmatters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders\nare not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any\ndescriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of 1Life, Amazon or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or\nbusinesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger\nAgreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of 1Life,\nAmazon and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure schedule to the\nMerger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger\nAgreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide\nany other factual information regarding 1Life, Amazon, Merger Sub or their respective businesses.

As a result of the Merger, (a) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease,\nand 1Life will continue as the Surviving Corporation of the Merger and (b) the Merger will have the effects set forth in the Merger Agreement and in the\napplicable provisions of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges and powers of 1Life and Merger Sub will vest in the\nSurviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of 1Life and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving\nCorporation.\nAt the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of 1Life as in effect as of July 20, 2022, the date of the Merger Agreement (the \u201c1Life Charter\u201d) will\nbe amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form attached to the Merger Agreement as Exhibit A, until subsequently amended as provided\nin the 1Life Charter or by applicable law. Amazon and 1Life will take such actions reasonably necessary to cause the bylaws of 1Life as in effect as of the\nJuly 20, 2022, date of the Merger Agreement (the \u201c1Life Bylaws\u201d) to be amended in their entirety pursuant to the Merger to conform to the bylaws of\nMerger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name will be \u201c1Life Healthcare, Inc.\u201d), and as so amended will be the\nbylaws of the Surviving Corporation until subsequently amended as provided in the 1Life Bylaws or by applicable law.\n79Table of Contents\nAt the Effective Time: (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the only directors of the Surviving Corporation as of\nimmediately following the Effective Time and (b) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the only officers of the\nSurviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and\nqualified or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving\nCorporation.\nClosing and Effective Time\nUnless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Closing will take place by electronic exchange of deliverables at 9:00\na.m., New York time, on the third (3rd) business day after the satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible under applicable law) of all of the conditions\nto Closing set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing (subject to their\nsatisfaction or written waiver (where permissible))), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Amazon and 1Life. The date on which the\nClosing occurs is referred to in the Merger Agreement as the \u201cClosing Date.\u201d\nOn the Closing Date, or on such other date as Amazon and 1Life may agree to in writing, Amazon, Merger Sub and 1Life will cause a certificate of merger\n(the \u201cCertificate of Merger\u201d) to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as required by and in accordance\nwith Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the\nState of Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by Amazon and 1Life and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the\nDGCL, such date and time are referred to as the \u201cEffective Time.\u201d\nMerger Consideration\nCommon Stock\nEach share of 1Life common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a \u201cShare\u201d and collectively, the \u201cShares\u201d), other\nthan the Excluded Shares, will be

In connection with the Merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, in the event that Amazon desires to consummate a repurchase offer or similar transaction, in each case in\nAmazon\u2019s sole discretion, with respect to any or all of the Convertible Notes (any such transaction, a \u201cRepurchase Transaction\u201d), each of 1Life, Amazon\nand Merger Sub will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to, and will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their\nrespective subsidiaries and representatives (and, in the case of 1Life, the Trustee under the Indenture) to, cooperate with one another in good faith to\npermit such Repurchase Transaction to be effected on such terms, conditions and timing as reasonably requested by Amazon, and 1Life will use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to assist Amazon in the preparation of any documentation related thereto reasonably requested by Amazon, in each case\nin form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Amazon\u037e provided that (i) the Repurchase Transaction will not be consummated prior to the Closing\u037e\nand (ii) Amazon will pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by 1Life in taking actions requested by Amazon in\nconnection with a Repurchase Transaction.\nExchange and Payment Procedures\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, prior to the Effective Time, Amazon will (i) appoint a bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be\nunreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by 1Life as (the \u201cPaying Agent\u201d), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and\nsubstance reasonably acceptable to 1Life (the \u201cPaying Agent Agreement\u201d), with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in\naccordance with the Merger Agreement. At or before the Closing, Amazon will deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying\nAgent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration\nrequired to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cPayment Fund\u201d). The\n82\nTable of Contents\nPayment Fund will not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Amazon\u037e provided,\nhowever, that such investments will be in obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith\nand credit of the U.S., and that such investments will only be invested in the manner provided in the Paying Agent Agreement. Any net profit resulting\nfrom, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation.\nAs promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) business days thereafter), Amazon will cause the Paying Agent to\nmail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the \u201cCertificates\u201d), which Shares were converted into the right to\nreceive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will be\neffected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (if any) will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)\nto the Paying Agent, and will otherwise be in customary form and have such other provisions as Amazon or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify\nand (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or\neffective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Amazon, and upon\ndelivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates will be entitled to\nreceive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates. Any Certificates so surrendered will then be canceled. The\nMerger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to\nShares formerly represented by such Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name\nany surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will\nbe otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the\npayment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will have established to the\nsatisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-\nentry (\u201cBook-Entry Shares\u201d), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement, will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger\nConsideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, each registered holder of one or more such Book-Entry\nShares will automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as\nsoon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, within five (5) business days thereafter), the Merger Consideration payable for\neach such Book-Entry Share. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the person in whose name\nsuch Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after\nthe Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. No interest will be paid or\nwill accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of 1Life, Amazon and Merger Sub.\nSome of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by 1Life are qualified as to \u201cmateriality\u201d or \u201c1Life Material Adverse Effect.\u201d\nFor purposes of the Merger Agreement, \u201c1Life Material Adverse Effect\u201d means any event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect that,\nindividually or in the aggregate with any other event, circumstance, change, condition, occurrence or effect, has had, or would reasonably be expected to\nhave, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the assets, business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of (a)\n1Life, (b) 1Life\u2019s subsidiaries and (c) all of the professional medical organizations and professional limited liability companies and other entities and any\nand all of their subsidiaries, to which 1Life or any of its subsidiaries provides administrative and business support\n83\nTable of Contents\nservices under a management services agreement or administrative services agreement (collectively, the \u201cAffiliated Practices\u201d and together with 1Life and\n1Life\u2019s subsidiaries, the \u201c1Life Group\u201d), taken as a whole.

Accordingly, each party to the Merger\nAgreement agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger\nAgreement, the non-breaching party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including\nmonetary damages, subject to certain exceptions contained in\n104\nTable of Contents\nthe Merger Agreement) to (i) seek an order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (ii)\nseek an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

The Merger Agreement may not be amended\nexcept by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement.\nGoverning Law\nThe Merger Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable\nprinciples of conflict of laws that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to otherwise govern the Merger Agreement,\nexcept for all matters relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) of\nthe Definitive Financing Documentation will be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic law of the State of New York\nwithout giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause the\napplication of law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends, on behalf of 1Life,\nthat you vote \u201cFOR\u201d this proposal.\n105\nTable of Contents",

Any Certificates so\nsurrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates shall be deemed to have been\npaid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made\nto a person other than the person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate\nso surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall have paid any\ntransfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so\nsurrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving\nCompany or Parent, as the case may be, and duly paid to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this\nAgreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards in respect of which such\ndeduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be and none of the Paying Agent, the\nSurviving Company or the Parent, as the case may be, shall be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to such deducted or withheld\namounts.\n4\nTable of Contents\n(f) Lost Certificates.
