How will my Argo Group equity awards be\ntreated in the merger?\nThe merger agreement provides that the Argo Group\u2019s equity awards that are outstanding immediately\nprior to the effective time will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time:\nRestricted Shares. Each Argo Group restricted share will (i) become fully vested, in the case of a time-\nbased vesting Argo Group restricted share, or become vested at an assumed level of performance, in the\ncase of a performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share, based on the following: (a) if the\neffective time occurs prior to half-way through the applicable performance period, then the number of\nArgo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group restricted share\nwill be based on the applicable performance goals being deemed to have been satisfied at the target\nlevel\u037e and (b) if the effective time occurs on or after half-way through the applicable performance period,\nthen the number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo\nGroup restricted share will be based on the projected actual level of performance through the end of the\napplicable performance period, as determined by Argo Group board of directors in accordance with the\nterms of the Argo Group share plans prior to the date of the effective time taking into account\nperformance through the date of such determination (but, if the Argo Group board of directors\ndetermines in good faith that the projected actual level of performance is not reasonably determinable,\nthe number of Argo Group common shares in respect of such performance-based vesting Argo Group\nrestricted share will be based on the target level), and (ii) be canceled and converted into solely the\nright to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of (x) the merger consideration of\n$30.00 and (y) the value of any dividends accrued in respect of such Argo Group restricted share that\nremain unpaid as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required withholding\ntaxes.\nShare Appreciation Rights. Each Argo Group SAR outstanding immediately prior to the effective time,\nwhether vested or unvested, will be deemed to be fully vested and will be canceled and converted into\nsolely the right to receive a lump-sum amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the\nexcess, if any of (a) the merger consideration of $30.00, over (b) the per share exercise price of such\nArgo Group SAR, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Argo Group common shares subject to such\nArgo Group SAR immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, less any required withholding\ntaxes.\nEmployee Share Purchase Plan.

Argo Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to\nprocure that participants holding outstanding options under the UK ESPP will exercise their options\neffective on the closing date in respect of the maximum number of Argo Group common shares possible\nunder the terms of their options as of the closing date, and receive, in respect of each such Argo Group\ncommon share, the merger consideration of $30.00 in cash, without interest and less any required\nwithholding taxes. If a participant in the UK ESPP so exercises their options, at the closing date, the\nbalance of their options not so exercised, if any, will immediately lapse and the participant will have a\nright to receive a compensation payment in cash, without interest and less any required withholding\ntaxes, in respect of such unexercised options of an amount which is, once paid net of applicable income\ntax and employee\u2019s social security due on such gross amount, equal to (i) the merger consideration of\n$30.00 in respect of each Argo Group common share underlying such unexercised options, less the\napplicable exercise price per such Argo Group common share, multiplied by (ii) the number of Argo\nGroup common shares that the participant would otherwise have been able to acquire on exercise of\ntheir unexercised options at the latest possible time had they continued to make savings under the\nterms of the UK ESPP for a period of up to six months from the closing date. Participants in the UK ESPP\nwill not be permitted to increase the percentage of their payroll deduction elections from those in effect\nas of February 8, 2023, and no additional persons will be permitted to commence participation in the UK\nESPP from and after February 8, 2023. The Argo Group will take all actions necessary or required to\ncause the UK ESPP to be terminated immediately following the exercise or lapse of all options.\nWhat is the required quorum for the special general meeting?\nPursuant to Argo Group\u2019s Bye-Laws, a majority of the outstanding shares carrying the right to vote,\npresent in person or represented by proxy, constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the\nspecial general meeting.\nEach common share and preferred share carries the right to vote on the merger proposal and the\nadjournment proposal. Accordingly, the quorum required at the special general meeting to consider the\nmerger proposal and the adjournment proposal is the presence in person or represented by proxy of\nshareholders representing in excess of 50% of the total voting power of all outstanding common shares\nand preferred shares, voting as one class, as of the record date. Only common shares carry the right to\nvote on the compensation advisory proposal.

Because approval of the\ncompensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders\nof common shares that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special\ngeneral meeting (assuming a quorum is present), an abstention with respect to the compensation\nadvisory proposal will not have the effect of a vote for or against the compensation advisory proposal,\nbut will reduce the number of votes cast and therefore increase the relative influence of those\nshareholders voting. Because approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares, voting as one\nclass, that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special general\nmeeting, an abstention with respect to the adjournment proposal will have the effect of a vote against\nthe adjournment proposal, but common shares or preferred shares deemed not in attendance at the\nspecial general meeting, whether due to a record holder\u2019s failure to vote or a \u201cstreet name\u201d holder\u2019s\nfailure to provide any voting instructions to such holder\u2019s bank, broker or other nominee, will have no\neffect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal.\nDoes Brookfield Reinsurance have the financial resources to complete the merger?\nYes.

As a result of the merger under Bermuda law, Argo Group\u2019s and\nMerger Sub\u2019s respective undertakings, property and liabilities will become vested in Argo Group as the\nsurviving company following the merger.\nAt the effective time, each common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time\n(other than any common share that is owned by Argo Group as treasury shares, by Argo Group, Brookfield\nReinsurance, Merger Sub or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any\ncommon share that is subject to an Argo Group equity award) will be canceled and converted into the right\nto receive the merger consideration.\nAt the effective time, each preferred share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time\nwill continue as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger and the\nrelative rights, terms and conditions of each such preferred share will remain unchanged.\nBackground of the Merger\nThe Argo Group board of directors and Argo Group\u2019s senior management periodically review Argo\nGroup\u2019s operations, financial condition, financial performance and long-term strategic plans and objectives,\nas well as industry conditions, regulatory developments and their impact on Argo Group\u2019s long-term\nstrategic plan and objectives. During the past two years, the Argo Group board of directors has reviewed\nand considered the current and future industry trends and risks to Argo Group\u2019s ability to execute its\nstrategic plan as a stand-alone entity, including the impact of adverse development of Argo Group\u2019s loss\nreserves, continuing consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance industry, losses incurred within the\ninsurance and reinsurance industry and increasingly competitive pricing in many of the insurance and\nreinsurance markets in which Argo Group operates. In connection with Argo Group\u2019s strategic review\nprocess and consideration of a potential transaction, between April 2022 and February 8, 2023 (the date of\nthe announcement of the transaction with Brookfield Reinsurance), the Argo Group board of directors and\nthe strategic review committee of the board of directors (the \u201cstrategic review committee\u201d) collectively met\nover 40 times.\nBeginning in September 2021, Argo Group received requests from a shareholder of Argo Group to,\namong other things, initiate a review of potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of Argo Group.\nOn March 23, 2022, another institutional shareholder of Argo Group sent a letter to the Argo Group\nboard of directors requesting, among other things, that the Argo Group board of directors initiate a review of\npotential strategic alternatives, including a sale of Argo Group.\nOn March 28, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met to discuss, among other things, Argo Group\u2019s\nlong term strategic plan and the possibility of initiating a review of potential strategic alternatives, including\na sale of Argo Group.\nBetween March 28, 2022 and April 26, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors, together with members\nof Argo Group\u2019s senior management team, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Argo Group\u2019s financial advisor,\nand Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d), Argo Group\u2019s outside legal counsel, discussed\nand evaluated the possibility of initiating a strategic review process for Argo Group. Management solicited\nand received input from certain shareholders during this time period, and this feedback was shared with the\nArgo Group board of directors to inform its decision with respect to commencing a strategic review process.\n24 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn April 21, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and ASW Law Limited (\u201cASW\u201d), Argo Group\u2019s outside Bermuda legal\ncounsel. At the meeting, representatives of Skadden and ASW presented to the directors regarding the legal\nprinciples and standards that would apply if the Argo Group board of directors were to consider a potential\ntransaction. The directors also discussed, among other things, the possibility of initiating a strategic review\nprocess and certain related matters, including communications guidelines and best practices, preparing\nfinancial projections and the scope of outreach to potential counterparties. Representatives of Skadden also\nreviewed with the Argo Group board of directors a proposed form of engagement letter for engaging\nGoldman Sachs to serve as Argo Group\u2019s financial advisor in connection with a potential strategic review\nprocess. Goldman Sachs had previously been engaged by Argo Group to assist with shareholder activism\nmatters in connection with Argo Group\u2019s 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders.\nOn April 26, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, at which meeting, among other things, the board of\ndirectors determined to initiate a strategic review process for Argo Group, including exploring a potential\nsale, merger or other strategic transaction with respect to Argo Group.\nLater on April 26, 2022, Argo Group engaged Goldman Sachs to serve as its financial advisor in\nconnection with the strategic review process, including the possible sale of all or a portion of Argo Group.\nOn April 28, 2022, Argo Group issued a press release announcing that it was initiating a strategic review\nprocess to explore potential strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value, including, among\nother things, a potential sale, merger or other strategic transaction.\nLater on April 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group\nboard of directors, began outreach to a list of potential counterparties approved by Argo Group, including\nsharing a form of confidentiality agreement with such potential counterparties. During the nine-month period\nbetween April 2022 and the time of entry into the merger agreement with Brookfield Reinsurance, more than\n80 potentially interested parties were contacted at the direction of the Argo Group board of directors.\nOn May 4, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, (i) the status of outreach\nto potential counterparties, (ii) the confidential information memorandum prepared by Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement with the assistance of Goldman Sachs to be provided to any potential counterparties that\nentered into confidentiality agreements with Argo Group, (iii) the status of negotiations of confidentiality\nagreements with potential counterparties, (iv) Goldman Sachs\u2019 assessment of the level of interest expressed\nby the parties it had contacted with respect to a potential strategic transaction with Argo Group and (v)\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 anticipated timeline for management presentations to potential counterparties.\nFrom May 4, 2022 through May 23, 2022, Argo Group entered into confidentiality agreements with 18\ncounterparties in connection with its initial outreach process regarding a potential sale of Argo Group, all of\nwhich included customary standstill provisions (including \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provisions). Each such\nconfidentiality agreement contained an exception to the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t waive\u201d provision allowing for the\ncounterparty to make a confidential proposal to the Argo Group board of directors at any time.\nOn June 1, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, (i) the feedback received\nfrom potential counterparties who had entered into confidentiality agreements with Argo Group with respect\nto a potential transaction, (ii) materials that were provided to such parties in connection with their ongoing\ndue diligence, including the confidential information memorandum, and (iii) the anticipated timeline for due\ndiligence being conducted by potential counterparties. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also informed the\nArgo Group board of directors that, in connection with its outreach to potential counterparties, the Westfield\nGroup (\u201cWestfield\u201d) had communicated interest to Argo Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer in potentially\nacquiring, or having one of its affiliates acquire, Argo Group\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business and the\ndirectors discussed possibly pursuing a sale of the Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business to Westfield as part of\nthe ongoing strategic review process. The Argo Group board of directors also determined to form the\nstrategic review committee, which initially consisted of Thomas A. Bradley (Chair), Bernard Bailey, Fred\nDonner and Dymphna Lehane, in order to (i) explore, consider and examine all potential transactions with\nrespect to Argo\n25 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGroup that the strategic review committee determined to be advisable to consider in the course of the\nstrategic review process and (ii) make recommendations to the Argo Group board of directors concerning\npotential transactions that the strategic review committee deemed appropriate, including a recommendation\nas to whether the final terms of any such potential transaction were in the best interests of Argo Group and\nshould be approved by the Argo Group board of directors and, if applicable, by Argo Group\u2019s shareholders.\nThe strategic review committee was not obligated to take any specific action with respect to any potential\ntransaction and was permitted to take no action if it deemed advisable.\nOn June 21, 2022, three parties, which we refer to as \u201cParty A,\u201d \u201cParty B\u201d and \u201cParty C\u201d submitted\ninitial, non-binding indications of interest to representatives of Goldman Sachs with respect to a potential\ntransaction with Argo Group, which were communicated to the Argo Group board of directors. Party A\nproposed a stock-for-stock merger with pro forma ownership of 48% for Argo\u2019s existing shareholders and\n52% for Party A\u2019s shareholders following completion of the proposed transaction and an implied value of\n$49.71 per Argo Group common share, with such pro forma ownership split and implied per common share\nvalue based on Party A\u2019s valuation assumptions which Argo Group had not yet been able to verify through\ndiligence. Party A also stated that in connection with its proposed transaction, it would expect to release up\nto $500 million of excess capital to repurchase shares from Argo Group shareholders following completion of\nthe transaction. Party B proposed to acquire Argo Group for $40.00 per common share in cash, which\nrepresented a 4.17% premium to the then-current trading price of Argo Group\u2019s common shares. Party C\nproposed to acquire Argo Group for cash consideration at or around the then-current trading price of Argo\nGroup\u2019s common shares. On that same day, two other parties also submitted indications of interest in\nacquiring certain core business lines of Argo Group, but not in a whole company acquisition of Argo Group.\nOn June 27, 2022, Argo Group received an initial, non-binding indication of interest from Ohio Farmers\nInsurance Company (\u201cOhio Farmers\u201d), part of Westfield, pursuant to which Ohio Farmers proposed to\nacquire the entire issued share capital of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited, the entity operating Argo\nGroup\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business.\nOn June 29, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the status of the\nstrategic review process, including the indication of interest received from Ohio Farmers with respect to the\nacquisition of the Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business and the five preliminary indications of interest received\non June 21, 2022. Following review of the three indications of interest for a whole company merger or\nacquisition of Argo Group, including discussions with the members of management present at the meeting\nregarding (i) feedback received from potential interested parties regarding the need for Argo Group to\nadvance simplification of its portfolio, exit international business lines and improve its reserve positions in\norder for such parties to further consider a potential business combination transaction with Argo Group and\n(ii) the potential for one or more of the offer prices in the preliminary indications of interest to be decreased\nfollowing further diligence by the parties, the Argo Group board of directors determined to pursue the sale of\nthe Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business to Ohio Farmers and to pause its outreach process to interested parties\nregarding a whole company merger or sale of Argo Group until it had entered into a definitive agreement with\nOhio Farmers to sell the Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business, which, based on interested party feedback, the\nArgo Group board of directors believed would potentially increase the number of parties interested in\npursuing a whole company business combination transaction with Argo Group.\nDuring July and early August of 2022, Argo Group evaluated and discussed a potential loss portfolio\ntransfer agreement with Enstar Group Limited (\u201cEnstar\u201d) and its affiliates, including providing due diligence\ninformation to Enstar.\nOn August 2 and 3, 2022, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo\nGroup\u2019s management, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, at which, among other things, the board of\ndirectors discussed the impact of potential strategic transactions being considered by Argo Group, including\na potential sale of the Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business, on the financial projections prepared by Argo\nGroup\u2019s management that were previously distributed to parties that had entered into confidentiality\nagreements with Argo Group.\nOn August 4, 2022, following a review of his qualifications and background, Argo Group\u2019s board of\ndirectors appointed J.

The\nLPT is expected to provide protection against reserve volatility and provide the Argo Group with additional\ncapital flexibility.\nDuring August and early September of 2022, Argo Group evaluated and discussed a potential sale of its\nLloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business to Ohio Farmers, including providing due diligence information to Ohio\nFarmers.\nOn September 8, 2022, Argo Group issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a\ndefinitive agreement for the sale of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200\nbusiness to Ohio Farmers for total cash proceeds of approximately $125 million (1.16x price to tangible book\nvalue or 0.81x price to book value as of first quarter 2022), subject to closing-related adjustments. The press\nrelease also noted that as part of Argo Group\u2019s previously announced and ongoing review of strategic\nalternatives, the Argo Group board of directors was continuing to actively consider a wide range of options\nfor Argo Group. In connection with the announcement, Argo Group also distributed an investor presentation\nregarding the strategic review developments, including the Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 sale and the LPT.\nFollowing the announcement of the Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 sale, the Argo Group board of directors\ninstructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to conduct additional outreach to a list of potential interested\nparties approved by Argo Group regarding a business combination transaction.

Party A also stated that in connection with its proposed transaction, it\nwould expect to release up to $500 million of excess capital to repurchase shares from Argo Group\nshareholders following completion of the transaction. Party E proposed a stock-for-stock merger with pro\nforma ownership of 41.2% for existing Argo shareholders and 58.8% for Party E\u2019s shareholders following\ncompletion of the proposed transaction and an implied value of $40.40 per Argo Group common share, with\nsuch pro forma ownership split and implied per common share value based on Party E\u2019s valuation\nassumptions which Argo Group had not yet been able to verify through diligence.

After reviewing the terms of each proposal, the directors determined to permit\neach party that had submitted a proposal other than Party D to conduct further due diligence of Argo Group\nin connection with a potential transaction. The directors determined that the structure and potential value\nproposition of the proposal submitted by Party D was not attractive in comparison to the other four\nproposals received to merit continuing discussions with Party D.\nOn November 7, 2022, Argo Group reported its earnings results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022,\nincluding announcing a net adverse prior year reserve development of $16.2 million or 4.9 percentage points\non the loss ratio (as compared to $0.2 million or 0.1 percentage points on the loss ratio for the third quarter of\nfiscal year 2021).\nFrom November 10, 2022 through November 18, 2022, Argo Group held management presentations with\nBrookfield Reinsurance, Party A, Party B and Party E at Skadden\u2019s New York office.\nOn November 17, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group\nboard of directors, distributed a second round process letter to Brookfield Reinsurance, Party A, Party B and\nParty E.\nOn November 21, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group\nboard of directors, distributed a draft merger agreement prepared by Skadden to Brookfield Reinsurance,\nParty A, Party B and Party E.\nLater on November 21, 2022, the strategic review committee met, with representatives from Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the status of the\nongoing due diligence being conducted by Brookfield Reinsurance, Party A, Party B and Party E, and related\ndiscussions with such parties regarding a potential transaction.\nOn December 8, 2022, Party B notified representatives of Goldman Sachs that it was no longer interested\nin considering a possible strategic transaction with Argo Group.\nOn December 11, 2022, an additional party, which we refer to as \u201cParty F,\u201d submitted an initial, non-\nbinding indication of interest to representatives of Goldman Sachs, pursuant to which Party F proposed to\nacquire Argo Group for consideration in the range of $30.00-33.00 per common share, consisting of a mix of\ncash and Party F\u2019s stock.\nOn December 12, 2022, the strategic review committee met, with representatives from Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement and Goldman Sachs present, to discuss, among other things, the status of reverse due diligence\nbeing conducted by Argo Group with respect to Party A and Party E, in light of the reverse merger structures\nincluded in their respective proposals, and the status of due diligence of Argo Group being conducted by\nBrookfield Reinsurance, Party A and Party E.

The directors determined not to grant exclusivity to Brookfield\nReinsurance at that time so that they could provide Party E and Party F the opportunity to conduct\nadditional due diligence and submit revised proposals in early January 2023.\nOn January 11, 2023, Party F verbally submitted a revised proposal to acquire Argo Group for\nconsideration (consisting of a mix of cash and Party F\u2019s stock) that was meaningfully below the then-current\ntrading price of Argo Group\u2019s common shares.\nOn January 18, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance submitted an updated proposal to representatives of\nGoldman Sachs to acquire Argo Group for consideration of $29.50 per common share in cash, which proposal\nwas conditioned on (i) Voce agreeing to enter into a voting agreement to vote its Argo Group common shares\nin favor of the approval of a transaction with Brookfield Reinsurance and (ii) a two-week exclusivity period\nbetween Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance. Concurrently with the submission of the updated proposal\nby Brookfield Reinsurance, representatives of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP (\u201cDebevoise\u201d), outside legal\ncounsel to Brookfield Reinsurance, submitted a revised draft of the merger agreement and a draft exclusivity\nagreement to representatives of Skadden.\nOn January 18, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the updated proposals\nreceived from Brookfield Reinsurance and Party F. The directors concluded that Party F\u2019s latest proposal did\nnot offer sufficient value to Argo Group shareholders. The directors also discussed anticipated timing for\nreceiving an updated proposal from Party E in relation to Brookfield Reinsurance\u2019s request for a two week\nexclusivity period. The directors instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to inform Party E that it\nneeded to submit a revised proposal in the next several days and determined to schedule another board\nmeeting for January 22, 2023 to further discuss Brookfield Reinsurance\u2019s pending exclusivity request.\nOn January 22, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and ASW present. At the meeting, the representatives from Skadden\nand ASW reviewed with the Argo Group board of directors the legal principles and standards applicable to\nits consideration of a proposed transaction and also reviewed a disclosure letter provided by Goldman Sachs\nthat described material relationships between Goldman Sachs and Brookfield Reinsurance, Party E and Party\nF, as well as certain other related parties and Voce. The directors concluded that, based upon the disclosure\nletter provided by Goldman Sachs and the relationships described therein, Goldman Sachs did not have any\nmaterial conflicts of interest that would interfere with its ability to serve as Argo Group\u2019s financial advisor in\nconnection with a potential transaction involving Brookfield Reinsurance, Party E or Party F. Representatives\nof Goldman Sachs then joined the meeting and together with members of Argo Group\u2019s management,\nreviewed the financial projections prepared by Argo Group management and the preliminary financial\nanalyses prepared by Goldman Sachs based upon management\u2019s projections. The representatives of\nGoldman Sachs\n29 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nalso provided an overview of the revised proposal received from Brookfield Reinsurance to acquire Argo\nGroup for $29.50 per common share in cash and Brookfield Reinsurance\u2019s request for a two week exclusivity\nperiod. Following these discussions and in light of the fact that Party E had still not submitted an updated\nproposal, the Argo Group board of directors authorized representatives of Goldman Sachs to make a\ncounterproposal to Brookfield Reinsurance whereby (i) Brookfield Reinsurance would increase its offer price\nto $31.50 per common share in cash and (ii) Argo Group would agree to enter into exclusivity with Brookfield\nReinsurance through January 31, 2023.\nLater on January 22, 2023, representatives of Skadden sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to\nrepresentatives of Debevoise.\nOn January 23, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that it\nwould be willing to increase its offer price to $31.00 per common share in cash, subject to Argo Group\nagreeing to (i) suspend quarterly dividends on its common shares between signing and closing of a potential\ntransaction, (ii) a termination fee of 4.0% of the transaction equity value to be payable under the\ncircumstances set forth in the merger agreement and (iii) enter into exclusivity with Brookfield Reinsurance\nthrough January 31, 2023 in order to allow Brookfield Reinsurance to complete further due diligence. In a\nsubsequent discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs, acting at the direction of the Argo Group board\nof directors, indicated that Argo Group would be willing to enter into exclusivity with Brookfield Reinsurance\non that basis, subject to Brookfield Reinsurance agreeing to a termination fee of 3.5% of the transaction\nequity value to be payable under the circumstances set forth in the merger agreement.\nOn January 24, 2023, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance entered into an exclusivity agreement (the\n\u201cexclusivity agreement\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, Argo Group agreed to continue\ndiscussions on an exclusive basis with Brookfield Reinsurance regarding a possible transaction until the\nearliest of (i) 6:00 p.m., New York Time, on January 31, 2023, (ii) Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance\nexecuting a definitive written agreement for the consummation of a possible transaction, (iii) the date that\nBrookfield Reinsurance notified Argo Group in writing that Brookfield Reinsurance was no longer interested\nin pursuing a possible transaction on the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement and (iv)\nthe date Argo Group notified Brookfield Reinsurance in writing that Argo Group was no longer interested in\npursuing a possible transaction as a result of Brookfield Reinsurance (A) modifying or proposing to modify\nthe terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement or (B) introducing or proposing to introduce\nany term or condition that was inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity\nagreement.\nFrom January 24, 2023 until February 8, 2023, Argo Group and its advisors negotiated with Brookfield\nReinsurance and its advisors to finalize the terms of a potential transaction and Argo Group provided due\ndiligence information to Brookfield Reinsurance.\nAlso on January 24, 2023, representatives of Skadden sent an initial draft of the voting agreement\nprepared by representatives of Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP (\u201cSchulte\u201d), outside legal counsel to Voce, to\nrepresentatives of Debevoise.\nFrom January 26, 2023 to January 29, 2023, representatives of Skadden and Debevoise exchanged drafts\nof the merger agreement and related transaction documents. During this same period, representatives of\nDebevoise, Schulte and Skadden also exchanged drafts of the voting agreement.\nOn January 30, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs via\nemail that it had identified certain outstanding diligence items that it would need to obtain further\ninformation on and resolve prior to entering into a transaction with Argo Group and that until such diligence\nitems had been resolved, Brookfield Reinsurance was not willing to engage further with respect to\nnegotiation of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.\nOn January 31, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives from Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs updated the board of\ndirectors on the remaining diligence items identified by Brookfield Reinsurance earlier that day and the steps\nbeing taken by Argo Group\u2019s management and Goldman Sachs to resolve these points in order to resume\nnegotiations of the transaction documents. The Argo Group board of directors also authorized an extension\nof the exclusivity period with Brookfield Reinsurance, if requested by Brookfield Reinsurance, in order to\nprovide additional time to resolve the remaining diligence issues.\n30 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn January 31, 2023, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance entered into an amendment to the\nexclusivity agreement, pursuant to which Argo Group agreed to extend the exclusivity period with Brookfield\nReinsurance until the earliest of (i) 6:00 p.m., New York Time, on February 6, 2023, (ii) the execution and\ndelivery by Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance of a definitive written agreement for the consummation\nof a possible transaction, (iii) the date that Brookfield Reinsurance notified Argo Group in writing that\nBrookfield Reinsurance was no longer interested in pursuing a possible transaction on the terms and\nconditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement and (iv) the date Argo Group notified Brookfield\nReinsurance in writing that Argo Group was no longer interested in pursuing a possible transaction as a\nresult of Brookfield Reinsurance (A) modifying or proposing to modify the terms and conditions set forth in\nthe exclusivity agreement or (B) introducing or proposing to introduce any term or condition that was\ninconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusivity agreement.\nOn February 1, 2023, representatives of Debevoise sent a revised draft of the voting agreement to\nrepresentatives of Schulte and Skadden.\nOn February 2, 2023, Argo Group completed the sale of its Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1200 business to Ohio\nFarmers.\nOn February 3, 2023, Party E submitted a revised, non-binding proposal to Argo Group, pursuant to\nwhich Party E indicated it was not interested in submitting a whole company acquisition proposal for Argo\nGroup at that time, but proposed acquiring two business lines of Argo Group. Party E\u2019s proposal letter stated\nthat it was also willing to pursue either of those transactions on a stand alone basis. Argo Group did not\nengage with Party E regarding its revised, non-binding proposal.\nLater on February 3, 2023, Brookfield Reinsurance, following further due diligence regarding Argo\nGroup, communicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs an updated proposal to acquire Argo Group for\n$29.00 per common share in cash (conditioned on the suspension of quarterly dividends for Argo Group\u2019s\ncommon shares between signing and closing of a potential transaction). During the same discussion,\nBrookfield Reinsurance increased its offer price to $30.00 per common share in cash (conditioned on the\nsuspension of quarterly dividends for Argo Group\u2019s common shares between signing and closing of a\npotential transaction), but indicated that it was not willing to increase its offer price further.\nFollowing the discussions between representatives of Brookfield Reinsurance and Goldman Sachs on\nFebruary 3, 2023, representatives of Debevoise sent a revised draft of the merger agreement and related\ntransaction documents to representatives of Skadden.\nOn February 4, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the revised proposal of\n$30.00 per common share in cash received from Brookfield Reinsurance and the remaining open issues with\nrespect to the merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents, including with respect\nto the merger agreement (i) the matters that would constitute a burdensome condition that would excuse\nBrookfield Reinsurance from consummating the proposed transaction and (ii) the scope of certain covenants\nrelated to (A) the capital position of Argonaut Insurance Company (\u201cAIC\u201d), a subsidiary of Argo Group, and\n(B) treatment of Argo Group\u2019s Brazil license, and, with respect to the voting agreement (i) the duration of\ntransfer restrictions applicable to the covered shares, (ii) the scope of Argo Group\u2019s obligation with respect\nto the timing of filing this proxy statement and holding the special general meeting and (iii) the amount of\nVoce\u2019s out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. Argo Group\u2019s board of directors determined to continue\nnegotiating exclusively with Brookfield Reinsurance to resolve the remaining open points with respect to the\nmerger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents before responding to the updated\noffer price of $30.00 per common share proposed by Brookfield Reinsurance. At the meeting, the board of\ndirectors also discussed the updated proposal received from Party E on February 3, 2023, but determined not\nto engage further with Party E since Party E had indicated that they were not interested in a whole company\nacquisition of Argo Group.\nBetween February 4, 2023 and February 6, 2023, representatives of Debevoise and Skadden exchanged\ndrafts of the merger agreement and related transaction documents.\nOn February 6, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs and Skadden present, to discuss, among other things, the remaining issues\nwith\n31 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nrespect to the merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents, including with respect\nto the merger agreement (i) the matters that would constitute a burdensome condition that would excuse\nBrookfield Reinsurance from consummating the proposed transaction and (ii) the scope of certain covenants\nrelated to (A) tax matters, (B) AIC\u2019s capital position and (C) treatment of Argo Group\u2019s Brazil license, and,\nwith respect to the voting agreement (i) the duration of transfer restrictions applicable to the covered shares,\n(ii) the scope of Argo Group\u2019s obligation with respect to the timing of filing this proxy statement and holding\nthe special general meeting and (iii) the amount of Voce\u2019s out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. At the\nmeeting, Argo Group\u2019s board of directors determined to delegate authority to the strategic review committee\nto engage in further negotiations with Brookfield Reinsurance regarding its per common share offer price.\nOn February 6, 2023, the strategic review committee instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to\ninform Brookfield Reinsurance that Argo Group would be willing to accept Brookfield Reinsurance\u2019s revised\noffer price of $30.00 per common share, subject to resolution of the other open points with respect to the\nmerger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents.\nOn February 7, 2023, representatives of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance, Skadden and Debevoise\nengaged in discussions to resolve the remaining open points with respect to the merger agreement relating\nto (i) the matters that would constitute a burdensome condition that would excuse Brookfield Reinsurance\nfrom consummating the proposed transaction and (ii) the scope of certain covenants related to (A) tax\nmatters and (B) AIC\u2019s capital position. Representatives of Voce, Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance also\nhad a call to resolve the remaining open points with respect to the voting agreement regarding (i) the\nduration of transfer restrictions applicable to the covered shares, (ii) the scope of Argo Group\u2019s obligation\nwith respect to the timing of filing this proxy statement and holding the special general meeting and (iii) the\namount of Voce\u2019s out-of-pocket expense reimbursement. The parties also exchanged drafts of the transaction\ndocuments during the course of the day.\nOn February 8, 2023, the Argo Group board of directors met, with representatives of Argo Group\u2019s\nmanagement, Goldman Sachs, Skadden and ASW in attendance. Representatives of Skadden and ASW\ndiscussed with the Argo Group board of directors the legal principles and standards applicable to its\nconsideration of the proposed transaction. Representatives of Skadden also reviewed the terms and\nconditions set forth in the proposed merger agreement, voting agreement and other transaction documents,\nincluding, among other things, the parties\u2019 respective termination rights (including Argo Group\u2019s right to\nterminate the merger agreement if Argo Group\u2019s board of directors in the exercise of the directors\u2019 fiduciary\nduties, changes its recommendation with respect to the proposed transaction), the termination fee payable in\nconnection with certain termination events under the proposed merger agreement, the obligations of the\nparties to obtain applicable regulatory approvals, the definition of a \u201cmaterial adverse effect,\u201d the applicable\nclosing conditions and the treatment of Argo Group\u2019s outstanding preferred shares. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs then joined the meeting and reviewed with the Argo Group board of directors Goldman\nSachs\u2019 financial analyses of the merger consideration, as more fully described below under the heading \u201c-\nOpinion of Argo Group\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d. Thereafter, at the request of the Argo Group board of\ndirectors, representatives of Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Argo Group board of directors\n(which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Goldman Sachs\u2019 written opinion dated the same\ndate) that, as of February 8, 2023 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth\ntherein, the $30.00 in cash per common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance\nand its affiliates) of Argo Group common shares pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial\npoint of view to such holders of Argo Group common shares. After discussion, and in light of the Argo\nGroup\u2019s board of directors\u2019 review and consideration of the factors described under \u201c- Argo Group\u2019s\nReasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Argo Group Board of Directors,\u201d the Argo Group board of\ndirectors unanimously (i) approved the merger, the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement, (ii)\ndetermined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger are in the best interests of Argo\nGroup, (iii) declared the advisability of the merger agreement, the statutory merger agreement and the merger\nand (iv) resolved to recommend approval of the merger, the merger agreement and the statutory merger\nagreement to Argo Group\u2019s shareholders (subject to the right of the Argo Group board of directors to\nwithdraw, modify or amend such recommendation or terminate the merger agreement in accordance with the\nterms of the merger agreement).\nFollowing the conclusion of the meeting of the Argo Group board of directors on February 8, 2023, Argo\nGroup and Brookfield Reinsurance entered into the merger agreement and issued a joint press release\n32 \n",

In addition, Argo Group, Voce and\nBrookfield Reinsurance entered into the voting agreement.\nOn February 13, 2023, Mr. Plants informed Argo Group that he intended to step down from the Argo\nGroup board of directors, effective immediately.\nOn February 15, 2023, following Mr. Plants\u2019 resignation for the board of directors, the Argo Group board\nof directors determined to reduce the size of the board of directors from seven directors to six directors. The\nArgo Group board of directors also determined to dissolve the strategic review committee in light of the fact\nthat the merger agreement had been executed.\nArgo Group\u2019s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Argo Group Board of Directors\nThe Argo Group board of directors unanimously (1) approved the merger agreement, the statutory\nmerger agreement and the merger, (2) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory\nmerger are in the best interests of Argo Group, (3) declared the advisability of the merger agreement, the\nstatutory merger agreement and the merger and (4) resolved to recommend approval of the merger, the merger\nagreement and the statutory merger agreement to Argo Group\u2019s shareholders (subject to the right of the\nArgo Group board of directors to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation or terminate the merger\nagreement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).\nFor purposes of Section 106(2)(b)(i) of the Companies Act, the Argo Group board of directors\ndetermined that the fair value for (i) each common share to be $30.00, without interest and less any applicable\nwithholding taxes and (ii) each preferred share (and the related depositary shares) to be the continuation of\neach such preferred share as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger\nwith all of its relative rights, terms and conditions remaining unchanged. In accordance with Section 106(2)\n(b)(ii) of the Companies Act, a dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair value of its shares.\nPositive Factors Relating to the Merger\nAs described in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger - Background of the Merger\u201d the\nArgo Group board of directors, prior to and in reaching its determination at its meeting on February 8, 2023\nthat the terms of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement are in the best interests of Argo\nGroup, consulted with the strategic review committee, Argo Group\u2019s management, financial advisors and\noutside legal counsel and considered a variety of potentially positive factors relating to the merger,\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\nTreatment of Common Shares\nThe value to be received by the holders of common shares in the merger, including the fact that the\ncash consideration to be received represents a significant premium relative to the trading price of the\ncommon shares. The merger consideration of $30.00 per common share represented a premium of\napproximately 48.7% to the closing price of common shares on September 7, 2022, the last full trading\nday prior to Argo Group announcing the sale of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd\u2019s\nSyndicate 1200 and the continuation of its strategic alternatives review process, and a premium of\n6.7% to the closing price of common shares on February 7, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the\nannouncement of the transaction.\nThe fact that the merger consideration of $30.00 per common share is 0.90x Argo Group\u2019s fully diluted\nbook value per share and 1.02x Argo Group\u2019s tangible book value per share, in each case for the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2022.\nThe fact that Argo Group engaged in an extensive, publicly announced review of strategic\nalternatives during the nine month period between April 2022 and the time of entry into the merger\nagreement with Brookfield Reinsurance, which included outreach to over 80 interested parties,\nexecuting confidentiality agreements with 27 of such parties and engaging in significant discussions\nand receiving proposals from six of such parties, and that at the conclusion of such process no other\nparty had expressed a\n33 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwillingness to make an offer in excess of the $30.00 per common share Brookfield Reinsurance has\nagreed to pay as described in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fBackground of\nthe Merger.\u201d\nThe belief of the Argo Group board of directors that, as a result of the negotiations between the\nparties, the merger consideration of $30.00 per share was the highest price per share for the common\nshares that Brookfield Reinsurance was willing to pay at the time of those negotiations and following\ncompletion of its due diligence.\nThe possibility that, if Argo Group did not enter into the merger agreement, it could take a\nconsiderable amount of time and involve a substantial amount of risk before the trading price of the\ncommon shares would reach and sustain the $30.00 per share value of the merger consideration, as\nadjusted for present value.\nThe likelihood, based on the extensive strategic review process conducted by Argo Group, that there\nwould be no other parties that would be willing to make an offer in excess of Brookfield Reinsurance\u2019s\noffer of $30.00 per common share if Argo Group did not enter into the merger agreement.\nThe fact that the merger consideration is to be paid entirely in cash, which will allow holders of\ncommon shares to realize, upon closing, a certainty of value in light of the risks and uncertainties\ninherent in Argo Group\u2019s prospects and the market, economic and other risks that arise from owning\nan equity interest in a public company.\nThe Argo Group board of directors\u2019 understanding of the Argo Group\u2019s business, operations,\nfinancial condition, earnings, prospects, competitive position and the nature of the industry in which\nthe Argo Group competes, including the short and long term risks, uncertainties and challenges\nfacing the Argo Group and such industry\u037e\nThe financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Argo Group board of directors by\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs as well as the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the Argo Group board\nof directors on February 8, 2023 that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various\nassumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the $30.00 in cash per\ncommon share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of Argo\nGroup common shares pursuant to the merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such\nholders of Argo Group common shares.\nTreatment of Preferred Shares\nThe fact that holders of preferred shares will continue to own preferred shares of Argo Group as the\nsurviving company following the merger and that the relative rights, terms and conditions of each\nsuch preferred share will remain unchanged.\nTerms of the Merger Agreement\nThe fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants of the parties and the conditions to closing, are\nreasonable.\nThe belief of the Argo Group board of directors that the conditions to the consummation of the\nmerger as set forth in the merger agreement are reasonable and customary, and the likelihood in the\nview of the Argo Group board of directors that the merger would be completed because of the limited\nnature of such conditions.\nThe availability of appraisal rights to Argo Group shareholders who do not vote in favor of the merger\nproposal and who are not satisfied they have been offered fair value for their shares, which rights\nprovide eligible shareholders with the opportunity to have the Bermuda Court appraise the fair value\nof their shares.\nThe fact that the Argo Group board of directors is permitted to modify or withdraw its\nrecommendation of the merger proposal in response to a material event or circumstance that was not\nknown to, or was not reasonably foreseeable by, the Argo Group board of directors on February 8,\n2023 if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial\n34 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022

discussions or negotiations with the third party making such a\nproposal, in each case if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after\nconsultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such \u201ctakeover proposal\u201d\neither constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d  (see the\nsection of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation of Takeover\nProposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation Change\u037e Alternative Acquisition Agreements\u201d)\u037e\nThe fact that the terms of the merger agreement provide that, under certain circumstances where\na takeover proposal has been received, Argo Group is permitted to entertain such takeover\nproposal, and the Argo Group board of directors is permitted to:\nmodify or withdraw its recommendation of the merger proposal in response to a superior\nproposal if the Argo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation\nwith its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would\nbe inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the\npayment of a $37,183,000 termination fee if Brookfield Reinsurance terminates the merger\nagreement\u037e or\nsubject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, terminate the merger agreement\nto enter into an alternative acquisition agreement in respect of a superior proposal if the\nArgo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial\nadvisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent\nwith the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to the payment of a\n$37,183,000 termination fee (see the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fNo Solicitation of Takeover Proposals\u037e Adverse Recommendation

Group board of directors on a non-public basis if the\nArgo Group board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Argo Group\u2019s\noutside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with\nthe directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law.\nThe belief of Argo Group\u2019s board of directors, based on consultation with Argo Group\u2019s financial\nadvisors and outside legal counsel, that the $37,183,000 termination fee, which is approximately\n3.5% of the estimated aggregate merger consideration payable in connection with the merger,\nwould not preclude other parties from making an acquisition proposal for Argo Group.\nThe absence of any financing condition or contingency for Brookfield Reinsurance to consummate\nthe merger and pay the merger consideration.\nThe fact that Voce, one of Argo Group\u2019s largest shareholders holding approximately 9.5% of the\noutstanding common shares, entered into a voting agreement, pursuant to which, among other\nthings, Voce agreed to vote all of its common shares owned as of the record date in favor of the\nmerger proposal during the term of the voting agreement.\nThe fact that Brookfield Reinsurance is a strong, well-capitalized company with ample resources to\nconsummate the transaction.\n35 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022

without\nsignificant delay, given its regulatory sophistication, track record of obtaining regulatory approvals\nin similar transactions, financial resources and high credit rating.\nBrookfield Reinsurance\u2019s commitment in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to\nconsummate the merger (subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement).\nRisk and Other Considerations of the Merger\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Argo Group board of directors, in consultation with the strategic\nreview committee, Argo Group\u2019s management, financial advisors and outside legal counsel, also considered a\nvariety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the merger, including the following:\nThe possibility that the merger might not be consummated, or that the consummation might be\ndelayed.\nThe risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and\noperational matters while implementing the merger.\nThat restrictions on the conduct of Argo Group\u2019s business prior to consummation of the merger could\ndelay or prevent Argo Group from undertaking business opportunities that arise pending\nconsummation of the merger, which opportunities might be lost to Argo Group if the merger is not\nconsummated.\nThe potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Argo Group\u2019s business and\nrelationships with customers, vendors, business partners and employees, including the risk that key\nemployees might not choose to remain employed with Argo Group prior to the consummation of the\nmerger, regardless of whether or not the merger is consummated.\nThe risk that Argo Group shareholders may not approve the merger proposal.\nThe risk that governmental entities may oppose or refuse to approve the merger or impose conditions\non Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance (or Brookfield or any of their respective affiliates) prior to\napproving the merger, which conditions may constitute a burdensome condition under the terms of\nthe merger agreement that would excuse Brookfield Reinsurance from consummating the merger.\nThe fact that the all-cash merger consideration, while providing certainty of value upon\nconsummation, would not allow holders of common shares to participate in any future earnings\ngrowth of Argo Group or benefit from any future increase in its value.\nThe fact that the merger agreement prohibits Argo Group from continuing to declare and pay regular\nquarterly cash dividends on the common shares.\nThe risk that legal proceedings could be initiated against Argo Group in connection with the merger.\nThe fact that some of Argo Group\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger\nthat are different from, or in addition to their interests as shareholders of Argo Group (see the section\nof this proxy statement titled \u201cThe Merger\u202f-\u202fInterests of Argo Group\u2019s Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger\u201d for a more detailed discussion of these interests).\nThe specific terms of the merger agreement that either individually or in combination, could\ndiscourage potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire Argo Group, including:\nThe terms of the merger agreement placing certain limitations on the ability of Argo Group to\nsolicit, encourage, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate the submission of any\ninquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead\nto, a takeover proposal or engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations\nregarding, or furnish any material non-public information for the purposes of facilitating, a\ntakeover proposal\u037e and\nThe fact that Argo Group will be required to pay Brookfield Reinsurance a termination fee in\nconnection with the merger if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, or\nwhich may become payable following a termination of the merger agreement in circumstances\n36 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nwhere no alternative transaction or superior proposal is ultimately consummated (which\ntermination fee the Argo Group board of directors determined was reasonable and customary).\nThe foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Argo Group board of directors is not\nintended to be exhaustive, but rather a summary of the material factors considered by the Argo Group board\nof directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, including the merger and other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Argo Group board of directors did not quantify or\nassign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different\nweights to different factors. The Argo Group board of directors considered the various factors as a whole,\nincluding discussions with, and questioning of, the strategic review committee, Argo Group\u2019s management,\nfinancial advisors and outside legal counsel, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to\nsupport, its determination.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Argo Group board of\ndirectors is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under\nthe section of this proxy statement titled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking\nInformation.\u201d\nOpinion of Argo Group\u2019s Financial Advisor\nGoldman Sachs rendered its opinion to Argo Group\u2019s board of directors that, as of February 8, 2023 and\nbased upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $30.00 in cash per common\nshare to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares\npursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of common shares.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 8, 2023, which sets forth assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the\nopinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services and its opinion for the information and\nassistance of Argo Group\u2019s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. Goldman Sachs\u2019\nopinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of common shares should vote with respect to the merger or any\nother matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses,\nGoldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:\nthe merger agreement\u037e\nannual reports to shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K and 10-K/A of Argo Group for the\nfive years ended December 31, 2021\u037e\ncertain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Argo Group\u037e\ncertain other communications from Argo Group to its shareholders\u037e\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Argo Group\u037e and\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Argo Group prepared by its management, as\napproved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Argo Group, including the financial projections (as defined and\nmore fully described in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cCertain Argo Group Prospective\nFinancial Information\u201d).\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Argo Group regarding\ntheir assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition, and future prospects of\nArgo Group\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the common shares\u037e compared certain\nfinancial and stock market information for Argo Group with similar information for certain other companies\nthe securities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business\ncombinations in the insurance industry\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered\nsuch other factors, including Sections 2.06 and 6.01(a)(i) of the merger agreement, as Goldman Sachs deemed\nappropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Argo Group\u2019s consent, relied upon and\nassumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other\ninformation provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for\nindependent\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nverification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Argo Group\u2019s consent that the financial\nprojections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and\njudgments of the management of Argo Group. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or\nappraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets\nand liabilities) of Argo Group or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or\nappraisal. Goldman Sachs is not an actuary and Goldman Sachs\u2019 services did not include any actuarial\ndetermination or evaluation by Goldman Sachs or any attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions and\nGoldman Sachs relied on Argo Group\u2019s actuaries with respect to reserve adequacy. In that regard, Goldman\nSachs made no analysis of, and expressed no opinion as to, the adequacy of the loss and loss adjustments\nexpenses reserves of Argo Group. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other\nconsents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse\neffect on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also\nassumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the\nwaiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its\nanalysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Argo Group to engage in\nthe merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available\nto Argo Group\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion\naddresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the $30.00 in cash\nper common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common\nshares pursuant to the Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not\naddress, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other\nagreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection\nwith the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection\ntherewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Argo Group\u037e\nnor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of Argo Group, or class of such persons in connection with the merger,\nwhether relative to the $30.00 in cash per common share to be paid to the holders (other than Brookfield\nReinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other condition as in effect on, and\nthe information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes\nno responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or\nevents occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to\nthe prices at which the common shares will trade at any time or, as to the potential effects of volatility in the\ncredit, financial and stock markets on Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or the merger, or as to the impact\nof the merger on the solvency or viability of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or the ability of Argo\nGroup or Brookfield Reinsurance to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019\nopinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the board\nof directors of Argo Group in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following\nsummary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by\nGoldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to\nthose analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information\npresented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone\nnot a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. In connection with its opinion, Goldman\nSachs considered, among other things, Sections 2.06 and 6.01(a)(i) of the merger agreement, pursuant to\nwhich Argo Group is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on the common shares at any time\nfrom the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the closing of the merger and the termination of the\nmerger agreement. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is\nbased on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 6, 2023, and is not\nnecessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nAnalysis of Implied Premiums\nGoldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices for the common shares for the one-year period\nending February 6, 2023. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of\ncommon shares pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to:\n38 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n$27.80, the closing price of the common shares on February 6, 2023 (which we refer to as the \u201cCurrent\nShare Price\u201d)\u037e\n$20.18, the closing price of the common shares on September 7, 2022, the last full trading day prior to\nArgo Group announcing the sale of Argo Underwriting Agency Limited and its Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate\n1200 and the continuation of its strategic alternatives review process (which we refer to as the \u201cShare\nPrice Prior to Continuation of Strategic Alternative Review\u201d)\u037e\n$78.07, the all-time highest closing price of the common shares (which we refer to as the \u201cAll-time\nHigh Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n$55.69, the highest closing trading price of the common shares for the 52-week period ended February\n6, 2023 (which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week High Price\u201d)\u037e\n$19.25, the lowest closing trading price of the common shares for the 52-week period ended February\n6, 2023 (which we refer to as the \u201c52-Week Low Price\u201d)\n$26.75, the volume weighted average price (which we refer to as the \u201cVWAP\u201d) of the common shares\nover the 30 trading-day period ended February 6, 2023 (which we refer to as the \u201c30-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n$24.52, the VWAP of the common shares over the 90 trading-day period ended February 6, 2023\n(which we refer to as the \u201c90-Day VWAP\u201d).\nThis analysis indicated that the price per common share to be paid to the holders of common shares\npursuant to the merger agreement represented:\nImplied Premium\nRepresented \nby $30.00 Per Common\nShare \nMerger Consideration\nReference Price Per Common Share\nCurrent Share Price of $27.80\n7.9\nShare Price Prior to Continuation of Strategic Alternative Review of $20.18\n48.7\nAll-time High Share Price of $78.07\n(61.6\n52-Week High Price of $55.69\n(46.1\n52-Week Low Price of $19.25\n55.8\n30-Day VWAP of $26.75\n12.2\n90-Day VWAP of $24.52\n22.4\nIllustrative Dividend Discount Analysis\nUsing the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative dividend discount analysis on\nArgo Group to derive a range of illustrative values per common share for Argo Group\u2019s fully diluted common\nshares. Goldman Sachs discounted the estimated capital return to shareholders (in the form of dividend\nstreams and share repurchases, adjusting for stock based compensation, as reflected in the financial\nprojections) from Argo Group for the period of the fourth quarter of 2022 through 2026, as reflected in the\nfinancial projections, and the range of terminal values to derive present values, as of September 30, 2022, for\nArgo Group. Goldman Sachs calculated a range of terminal values for Argo Group by applying P/BV multiples\nranging from 0.60x to 1.10x to the projected book value per common share including accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (which we refer to as the \u201cAOCI\u201d) of Argo Group in 2026 as reflected in the financial\nprojections. These illustrative P/BV multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account, among other things, the current and historical\nobserved P/BV multiples for Argo Group. Goldman Sachs used a range of discount rates from 8.50% to\n10.25%, reflecting estimates of Argo Group\u2019s cost of equity. Utilizing its professional judgment and\nexperience, Goldman Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by application of the Capital Asset Pricing\nModel (which we refer to as \u201cCAPM\u201d), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for\nArgo Group, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This\nanalysis implied a value of $25.08 to $43.79 per common share as of September 30, 2022 (based on the implied\ntotal number of fully diluted\n39 \n%\n%\n)%\n)%\n%\n%\n%\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncommon shares estimated to be outstanding as of February 3, 2023, of approximately 35.161 million shares, as\nprovided by Argo Group\u2019s management).\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nUsing the financial projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present\nvalue of an illustrative future value per common share. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated and\nimplied a range of theoretical future values per common share as of December 31, 2023 through December 31,\n2025, by applying illustrative P/BV multiples ranging from 0.60x to 1.10x to Argo Group\u2019s projected book\nvalue per common share (including AOCI) as of December 31 of each such year included in the financial\nprojections. These illustrative multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment\nand experience, taking into account current and historical P/BV multiples for Argo Group. Goldman Sachs\nthen discounted to present value as of September 30, 2022 both the theoretical range of future values per\ncommon share it derived for Argo Group (which ranged from $21.27 to $51.44 per common share) and the\nestimated dividends to be paid per common share through the end of the applicable period as reflected in the\nfinancial projections using a discount rate of 9.25%, reflecting an estimate of Argo Group\u2019s cost of equity.\nUtilizing its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs derived such estimated cost of equity by\napplication of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for Argo Group,\nas well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in\na range of implied present values of $20.52 to $42.10 per common share.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following eight selected transactions in the\ninsurance industry since 2013. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and\ncompared the equity value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in the\ntransaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s book value (including AOCI) as reported or calculated\nusing publicly available information for the most recent financial period reporting date prior to the\nannouncement (which we refer to as the \u201cP/BV multiples\u201d) of the applicable transaction. While none of the\ncompanies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to Argo Group, the\ncompanies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes\nof analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Argo Group\u2019s results, market sizes and product profile.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nAnnounced\nAcquiror\nTarget\nEquity \nValue \n($mm)\nP/BV\nJanuary 2021\nTowerBrook Capital Partners\u037e Further\nGlobal Capital Management\nProSight Global, Inc.\n$ 586\n0.96x\nAugust 2020\nThird Point Reinsurance Ltd.\nSirius International Insurance Group,\nLtd.\n788\n0.52x\nAugust 2018\nApollo Global Management, LLC\nAspen Insurance Holdings Limited\n2,600\n1.12x\nAugust 2018\nHartford Financial Services Group, \nInc.\nThe Navigators Group, Inc.\n2,152\n1.74x\nMay 2017\nIntact Financial Corporation\nOneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd.\n1,702\n1.65x\nDecember 2016\nLiberty Mutual Insurance Co.\nIronshore Inc.\n2,935\n1.38x\nMay 2015\nFosun International Limited.\nIronshore Inc.\n2,300\n1.21x\nJune 2013\nFairfax Financial Holdings Limited\nAmerican Safety Insurance\nHoldings, Ltd.\n306\n0.91x\nBased on the results of the foregoing P/BV multiples and Goldman Sachs\u2019 professional judgment and\nexperience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of price to book value (including AOCI) multiples of\n0.52x to 1.74x (representing the low and high premium, respectively, of the implied price to book value\nmultiples calculated for the transactions above) to (i) Argo Group\u2019s book value (including AOCI) per\ncommon\n40 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshare (based on fully diluted common shares outstanding as of February 3, 2023, as provided by Argo\nGroup\u2019s management) for the period ending September 30, 2022 of $33.72 per common share to derive a range\nof implied values per common share of $17.48 to $58.79 and (ii) Argo Group\u2019s estimated book value (including\nAOCI) per common share (based on the fully diluted common shares outstanding as of February 3, 2023, as\nprovided by Argo Group\u2019s management) for the period ending December 31, 2022 to derive a range of implied\nvalues per common share of $16.10 to $54.12.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial\nanalysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all\nof its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,\nGoldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional\njudgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above\nanalyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or the\ncontemplated transaction.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to Argo\nGroup\u2019s board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the holders (other than\nBrookfield Reinsurance and its affiliates) of common shares of the $30.00 in cash per common share to be\npaid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor\ndo they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based\nupon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are\ninherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the\nparties or their respective advisors, none of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance, Goldman Sachs or any\nother person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Argo Group and\nBrookfield Reinsurance and was approved by Argo Group\u2019s board of directors. Goldman Sachs provided\nadvice to Argo Group during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific\namount of consideration to Argo Group or its board of directors or that any specific amount of consideration\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to Argo Group\u2019s board of directors was one of many\nfactors taken into consideration by Argo Group\u2019s board of directors in making its determination to approve\nthe merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses\nperformed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal\ninvesting, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial\nactivities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and\nfunds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which\nthey co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in\nsecurities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments\nof Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including\nBrookfield Corporation (which we refer to as \u201cBN\u201d), a shareholder of Brookfield Reinsurance, and Voce, a\nsignificant shareholder of Argo Group, or any of their respective affiliates and, as applicable, portfolio\ncompanies or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the\nmerger agreement.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nFebruary 8, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting\nservices provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to Argo Group and/or its affiliates of approximately\n$10.0 million. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to\nBrookfield Reinsurance and/or its affiliates and BN and its affiliates and portfolio companies, from time to\ntime for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may receive, compensation, including\nhaving acted as a book runner in connection with an equity offering for SelectQuote, Inc., a portfolio\ncompany of BN, in March 2021\u037e as a book runner in connection with a bond offering for Vistra Operations\nCompany LLC, a subsidiary of Vistra Corp., a portfolio company of BN (which we refer to as \u201cVistra\u201d), in May\n2021\u037e as a book runner with respect to a term loan facility and asset-based loan facility in connection with\nBN\u2019s acquisition of DexKo Global Inc. in October 2021\u037e as a book runner in connection with an offering of\nperpetual preferred units for Vistra, in October 2021\u037e as lead book runner in connection with an offering of\nperpetual preferred units for Vistra in December 2021\u037e as financial advisor to Brookfield Property Partners\nL.P., an affiliate of BN, in connection with the sale of Capital Automotive LLC, a portfolio company of BN, in\nFebruary 2022\u037e and as a book runner in connection with a bond offering for Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC, a\nportfolio company of BN, in November 2022. During the two-year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman\nSachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by\nGoldman Sachs Investment Banking to Brookfield Reinsurance and/or its affiliates and BN and/or its\nsubsidiaries, of approximately $71 million. During the two-year period ended February 8, 2023, Goldman\nSachs Investment Banking has not been engaged by Voce or its affiliates to provide financial advisory or\nunderwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in\nthe future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance,\nVoce and their respective affiliates and BN and its affiliates and portfolio companies, for which Goldman\nSachs Investment Banking may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have co-\ninvested with BN, Voce and their respective affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited\npartnership units or other securities, as applicable, of BN, Voce and/or their respective affiliates from time to\ntime and may do so in the future.\nThe board of directors of Argo Group selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an\ninternationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to\nthe merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 26, 2022, Argo Group engaged Goldman Sachs to act as\nits financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. The engagement letter between Argo\nGroup and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available\nas of the date of announcement, at approximately $10.5 million, all of which is contingent upon\nconsummation of the merger. In addition, Argo Group has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of\nits expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related\npersons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nCertain Argo Group Prospective Financial Information\nArgo Group management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future\nperformance or earnings and is especially cautious of making projections due to the significant\nunpredictability inherent in its businesses. However, certain financial projections were prepared by Argo\nGroup\u2019s management and provided to and approved for use by, Goldman Sachs, a financial advisor to the\nArgo Group board of directors, in connection with its evaluation of the merger (which we refer to as the\n\u201cfinancial projections\u201d). The financial projections were not developed for the purposes of providing earnings\nguidance. In addition, Argo Group provided the financial projections to certain interested parties in\nconnection with their evaluation of a potential transaction with Argo Group, including Brookfield\nReinsurance.\nThe financial projections each represent only one scenario in a wide range of potential outcomes. While\npresented with numeric specificity, the financial projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions\nwith respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial\nconditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Argo Group\u2019s business, all of which are\ninherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Argo Group\u2019s control. The\nfinancial projections are subjective in many respects and thus are susceptible to multiple interpretations and\nperiodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections may\nalso be affected by Argo Group\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the\napplicable periods. As such, the financial projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject\nto risks and uncertainties,\n42 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nincluding the various risks set forth in the sections of this proxy statement titled \u201cCautionary Statements\nConcerning Forward-Looking Information\u201d and in Argo Group\u2019s most recent reports on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and\nother documents of Argo Group on file with or furnished to the SEC. Argo Group shareholders should read\nsuch sections of this proxy statement and such reports filed with the SEC for additional information\nregarding the risks inherent in forward-looking information such as the financial projections. The financial\nprojections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each\nsuccessive year.\nThe financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of\nCertified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information, but, in\nview of Argo Group\u2019s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis. However, this information is not\nfact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy\nstatement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial projections. Argo Group\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, KPMG LLP, has\nnot audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the financial\nprojections included below and, accordingly, KPMG LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of\nassurance with respect thereto. The KPMG LLP report, incorporated by reference in Item 15 of Argo Group\u2019s\nmost recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, relates to Argo\nGroup\u2019s previously issued financial statements and does not extend to the prospective financial information\nand should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the financial projections do not take into account any\ncircumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.\nCertain of the financial projections set forth herein were not prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cnon-GAAP\u201d) financial measures. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in\ncompliance with generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as \u201cGAAP\u201d), and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures as used in the financial projections may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts\nused by other companies or persons. Financial measures provided to a financial advisor are excluded from\nthe definition of non-GAAP financial measures and therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding\ndisclosures of non-GAAP financial measures, which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure to a GAAP financial measure. Accordingly, Argo Group has not provided a reconciliation\nof the financial measures included in the financial projections which have been provided to Goldman Sachs\nfor purposes of preparing its financial analyses and opinions.\nThe information about the financial projections set forth below do not give effect to the merger and\nnone of the financial projections take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated.\nYou are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the financial projections set forth below. The\ninclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that\nany of Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance or their affiliates, advisors or representatives considered or\nconsider the financial projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the financial projections\nshould not be relied upon as such.

Rehnberg and Borst no longer hold outstanding Argo Group awards.\nThe amounts in this column include both time-vesting and performance-vesting Argo Group restricted\nshares. Based on an assumed effective time that occurs on or after half-way through the applicable\nperformance period in respect of the performance-vesting Argo Group restricted shares, the number of\nperformance-based vesting Argo Group restricted shares included in this column is based on an\nassumed projected actual level of performance for the open performance periods as of the assumed\neffective time, as summarized below:\n(i) Three-year average Return on Common Equity (\u201cROCE\u201d) at 21%\u037e and\n(ii) Three-year compound annual growth rate of Tangible Book Value Per Share (\u201cTBVPS\u201d) at 0%.\nThe amounts in this column reflect the aggregate value of each executive officer\u2019s outstanding Argo\nGroup restricted shares as of the assumed effective time, which is equal to the product obtained by\nmultiplying the number of such restricted shares by the merger consideration of $30.00. For purposes of\nthe values reported in this column, dividends which have been accrued and unpaid in respect of the\noutstanding Argo Group restricted shares as of immediately prior to the assumed effective time have not\nbeen included.\nThe $43.80 exercise price of the Argo Group SARs is in excess of the merger consideration, so such\nArgo Group SARs will be cancelled for no consideration at the assumed effective time.\n47 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nValue to Directors in Respect of Argo Group Awards\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, each current non-employee director of Argo Group holds 2,266\nArgo Group restricted shares that are scheduled to vest on May 5, 2023. Based on the per share merger\nconsideration of $30.00, the value of the restricted shares held by each director is $67,980. Messrs. Latham,\nDonner and Plants no longer hold outstanding Argo Group restricted shares. Pursuant to the Argo Group\ndirector compensation program, Argo Group may grant its annual equity awards with a grant date fair value\nof $95,000 to Argo Group\u2019s non-employee directors in May of 2023 and pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement, this award will be granted in cash in lieu of equity. Depending on when the merger is completed,\nthis cash award may vest or be forfeited pursuant to their terms in accordance with the Argo Group director\ncompensation program, independent of the merger.\nStrategic Review Committee Compensation\nExcept for Mr. Bradley, each of Messrs. Bailey, Donner and Plants and Ms. Lehane received\ncompensation in the amount of $1,000 for his or her attendance at each formal meeting of the strategic review\ncommittee and reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with his or her service on the\nstrategic review committee. From the date of the strategic review committee\u2019s formation on June 1, 2022 to its\ndissolution on February 15, 2023, the strategic review committee convened for formal meetings 13 times.\nMessrs. Bradley and Bailey and Ms. Lehane were present for each of these meetings. Mr. Donner was\npresent for each of these meetings, except for the last formal meeting of the strategic review committee,\nwhich took place on December 12, 2022, immediately prior to his resignation from the board of directors of\nArgo Group on December 15, 2022, for a total of 12 meetings. Mr. Plants was present for each formal meeting\nof the strategic review committee from the date of his appointment to the strategic review committee on\nAugust 4, 2022 for a total of 9 meetings.\nTreatment of Purchase Rights under the ESPP\nMses. Comparato, Kiene and Snyder, together with other eligible employees, participate in the ESPP,\npursuant to which Argo Group common shares may be purchased, up to a maximum of $25,000 per calendar\nyear offering, at a price per share that is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of an Argo Group common\nshare on the first day of the applicable offering period or the last day of the applicable offering period.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, prior to the effective time of the merger, (i) the final purchase\nperiod under the ESPP will be terminated no later than four business days prior to the date on which the\neffective time of the merger occurs\u037e (ii) any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the final\npurchase period will be made, but the final purchase period will otherwise be treated as a fully effective and\ncompleted purchase period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP\u037e and (iii) the exercise (as of no later than\nfour business days prior to the date on which the effective time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right\npursuant to the ESPP will occur. The executive officers that currently participate in the ESPP will not be\npermitted to increase the percentage of their payroll deduction elections from those in effect as of February\n8, 2023, and no additional executive officers will be permitted to commence participation in the ESPP from and\nafter February 8, 2023.\nAnnual Bonus\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, in respect of Argo Group\u2019s calendar year in which the\neffective time occurs, each Argo Group executive officer who is employed as of immediately prior to the\neffective time (except for Mr. Bradley) will be eligible to receive an annual bonus in the normal course,\nsubject to the executive officer\u2019s continued employment through the regularly scheduled payment date. Each\nsuch executive officer also will be eligible to receive an annual bonus for Argo Group\u2019s calendar year in\nwhich the effective time occurs in an amount no less than the amount equal to the product obtained by\nmultiplying (i) the executive officer\u2019s full bonus entitlement for Argo Group\u2019s calendar year in which the\neffective time occurs, based on the actual level of performance as determined by the Argo Group board of\ndirectors prior to the closing, taking into account performance through the date of such determination, by (ii)\na fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed from January 1 of such\ncalendar year in which the effective time occurs through the closing and the denominator of which equals\n365. The target\n48 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nannual bonus for calendar year 2023 for each executive officer (except for Mr. Bradley) is as follows: $700,000\nfor Mr. Kirk, $375,000 for Ms. Comparato, $525,000 for Ms. Kiene and $700,000 for Ms. Snyder.\nCEO Transaction Bonus\nArgo Group and Mr. Bradley entered into a transaction bonus agreement on March 3, 2023, pursuant to\nwhich Mr. Bradley is eligible to receive a cash bonus opportunity of $1.2 million (which we refer to as the\n\u201ctransaction bonus\u201d), subject to his continued employment through the effective time of the merger and\ncontingent upon the consummation of the merger. The transaction bonus will be paid no later than the\nsecond payroll date following the effective time of the merger, subject to the foregoing conditions.\nPotential Severance Payments Upon a Qualifying Termination Following the Effective Time\u202f-\u202fESP\nArgo Group maintains the Executive Severance Plan (which we refer to as the \u201cESP\u201d). Each current\nexecutive officer is eligible to participate in the ESP, except for Mr. Bradley. The ESP provides that, in the\nevent that within 24 months following a change in control (as defined in the ESP), (i) the executive officer\u2019s\nemployment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d  (as defined in the ESP) or (ii) the executive officer resigns with\n\u201cgood reason\u201d  (as defined in the ESP), then the executive officer will be entitled to the following severance\npayments and benefits, subject to the executive officer\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims,\nand continued compliance with applicable restrictive covenants (as described below):\nA cash amount equal to 1.50 times the sum of the executive officer\u2019s (i) annual base salary and (ii)\ntarget annual bonus\u037e\nan amount equal to the executive officer\u2019s target annual bonus, pro-rated through the date of\nemployment termination\u037e\nfor U.S. executive officers only, COBRA health care continuation coverage for 18 months following a\nchange in control\u037e and\nreimbursement of any legal fees incurred by the executive officer in a good faith dispute to enforce\nrights under the ESP, or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding regarding the imposition of\nany \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax (as discussed below).\nThe closing of the merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of the ESP. If any payments\nand benefits to be paid or provided to an executive officer, whether pursuant to the terms of the ESP or\notherwise, would be subject to \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (which we refer to as the \u201cCode\u201d), the payments and benefits will be reduced to the extent\nnecessary to avoid such excise taxes, but only if such a reduction of pay or benefits would result in a greater\nafter-tax benefit to the executive officer. Each executive officer is subject to post-termination restrictive\ncovenant provisions pursuant to the terms of the ESP, including perpetual confidentiality and non-\ndisparagement covenants, and 18-month non-competition and employee and customer non-solicitation\ncovenants.\nBased on the assumptions described above under \u201c- Certain Assumptions\u201d, the table below sets forth\nthe estimated value of the severance payments and benefits that the executive officers of Argo Group (except\nfor Mr. Bradley) would be eligible to receive under the ESP. The estimated amounts below do not attempt to\nquantify any reductions in order to avoid any applicable \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise taxes under the Code, or\nany legal fees that could be incurred by an executive officer in connection with a dispute to enforce rights\nunder the ESP or any tax audit or proceeding regarding the imposition of any \u201cgolden parachute\u201d excise tax.\nName \nExecutive Officers\nCash\nSeverance \n($)\nProrated\nAnnual \nTarget Bonus \n($)\nHealth,\nMedical, \nDental\nBenefits \n($)\nScott Kirk\n$ 2,100,000\n$ 406,575\n-\nSusan B.

The 2023 LTI cash awards will vest in full if, within 24 months following the effective time, the\nexecutive officer\u2019s employment is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d  (as defined in the ESP) or the executive officer\nresigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (as defined in the ESP). The award agreements for the 2023 LTI cash awards will\ninclude certain post-termination restrictive covenant provisions, including a perpetual confidentiality\ncovenant, and 12\u2011month employee and customer non-solicitation covenants.\nThe amount of the 2023 LTI cash award for each executive officer (except for Mr. Bradley) is as follows:\n$700,000 for Mr. Kirk, $250,000 for Ms. Comparato, $300,000 for Ms. Kiene and $700,000 for Ms. Snyder. As a\ncondition to receiving a 2023 LTI cash award, each executive officer will be required to execute an\nacknowledgement in which the executive officer agrees that \u201cgood reason,\u201d for purposes of all Argo Group\narrangements in which the executive officer is eligible to participate, will not be triggered by or as a result of\nthe closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and Argo Group ceasing to be a\nstandalone public company or the executive officer ceasing to be an executive officer of a standalone public\ncompany (which we refer to as the \u201cgood reason acknowledgement\u201d). As of the date of this proxy statement,\nMs. Snyder is the only executive officer to execute the good reason acknowledgement. Mr. Kirk and Mses.\nComparato and Kiene have not executed the good reason acknowledgement and accordingly are not\ncurrently eligible to receive a 2023 LTI cash award, but the executive officer may elect to execute the good\nreason acknowledgement by no later than March 31, 2023.\nCompensation Arrangements with Brookfield Reinsurance\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, none of Argo Group\u2019s executive officers have entered into any\ndefinitive agreement with Brookfield Reinsurance or any of its affiliates regarding continued employment\nwith Brookfield Reinsurance, the surviving company or one or more of their affiliates. Prior to, or following\nthe effective time of the merger, however, some or all of Argo Group\u2019s executive officers may discuss or enter\ninto definitive agreements (which will take effect at or after the effective time of the merger) with Brookfield\nReinsurance regarding employment with, or the right to receive compensation and benefits from, Brookfield\nReinsurance or one or more of its affiliates (including the surviving company). In addition, pursuant to the\nmerger agreement, as described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fEmployee Matters,\u201d Brookfield Reinsurance\nhas agreed that it will provide, or will cause the surviving company to provide, during the continuation\nperiod (as defined below), certain levels of compensation and benefits to Argo Group employees (as defined\nbelow) who are employed by Ago Group immediately prior to the effective time.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nThe merger agreement provides for certain indemnification arrangements for Argo Group\u2019s current\nofficers and directors and the continuation of certain insurance arrangements for Argo Group\u2019s current\nofficers and directors for six years after the effective time.\nMerger-Related Compensation for Argo Group Named Executive Officers\nThe table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the\ncompensation for each named executive officer of Argo Group that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nmerger. This compensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC\n50 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable\nto the named executive officers of Argo Group.

The termination or expiration of the waiting period means\nthe parties have satisfied the regulatory requirements under the HSR Act. Argo Group and Brookfield\nReinsurance filed the required notifications with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on March 8, 2023.\nInsurance and Other Regulatory Matters\nThe insurance laws and regulations of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia generally require\nthat before the acquisition of control of an insurance company, either through the acquisition of or merger\nwith the insurance company or a holding company of that insurance company, the acquiring party must\nobtain approval from the insurance regulator of the insurance company\u2019s state of domicile. In addition, under\nthe laws of certain states, an acquirer must obtain the approval of the state\u2019s insurance regulator to acquire\ncontrol of an insurance company that is commercially domiciled in that state.\nApplications or notifications in connection with the merger or the changes in control of various\nsubsidiaries of Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance that may be deemed to occur as a result of the\nmerger have been filed, pursuant to the merger agreement, with various U.S. state regulatory authorities,\nincluding the Illinois Department of Insurance, New York State Department of Financial Services, Ohio\nDepartment of Insurance, Pennsylvania Insurance Department and Commonwealth of Virginia State\nCorporation Commission.\nApplications for approval or notifications to certain non-U.S. regulatory authorities have been filed with\nthe Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Italian Istituto per la vigilanza sulle assicurazioni.\nAlthough Argo Group and Brookfield Reinsurance do not expect these regulatory authorities to raise\nany significant concerns in connection with their review of the merger, there is no assurance that Argo\nGroup and Brookfield Reinsurance will obtain all required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, or\nthat these approvals will not include a restriction, limitation or condition that would trigger a burdensome\ncondition, which, in such case, would excuse Brookfield Reinsurance from closing the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and consummating the merger.\nOther than the approvals and notifications described above, neither Argo Group nor Brookfield\nReinsurance is aware of any material regulatory approvals required to be obtained, or waiting periods\nrequired to expire, after the making of a filing. If the parties discover that other approvals or filings and\nwaiting periods are necessary, they will seek to obtain or comply with them, although, as is the case with the\nregulatory approvals described above, there can be no assurance that they will be obtained on a timely\nbasis, if at all.\nPayment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Share Certificates\nPaying Agent\nPrior to the closing date, Brookfield Reinsurance will designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to\nArgo Group for the payment and delivery of the aggregate merger consideration. At or prior to the effective\ntime, Brookfield Reinsurance will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash in an amount\nsufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration.\nPayment Process\nAs soon as practicable, but in no event later than three business days after, the effective time, the\nsurviving company or Brookfield Reinsurance will cause the paying agent to mail a letter of transmittal (in a\nform subject to Argo Group\u2019s reasonable approval) to each holder of a share certificate that immediately prior\nto\n54 ",

The summary of the material\nprovisions of the merger agreement below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain\nall of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. Argo Group encourages you to\nread carefully the merger agreement in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger as it\nis the legal document governing the merger.\nThe merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with\ninformation regarding the terms of the merger agreement and is not intended to provide any factual\ninformation about Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance. Factual disclosures about Argo Group or\nBrookfield Reinsurance contained in this proxy statement or Argo Group\u2019s public reports filed with the\nSEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Argo Group or Brookfield\nReinsurance contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations,\nwarranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Argo Group, Brookfield Reinsurance and\nMerger Sub are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Argo Group, Brookfield\nReinsurance and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In\nparticular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and\ndescribed in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were\nnegotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement,\nrather than establishing matters as facts, and may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. The\nrepresentations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be\ndifferent from that generally relevant to shareholders or applicable to reports and documents filed with the\nSEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other,\nwhich disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The\nrepresentations and warranties in the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the merger.\nMoreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have\nchanged since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information\nqualifying a representation or warranty may have been included or incorporated by reference into this\nproxy statement. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any\ndescriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the\ninformation provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference\ninto this proxy statement. See the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More\nInformation.\u201d\nThe Merger\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the statutory merger agreement, and\npursuant to the applicable provisions of the Companies Act, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with\nand into Argo Group, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Argo Group will survive\nthe merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance.\nEffects of the Merger\nThe merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each common share issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time (other than any common share that is owned by Argo Group as\ntreasury shares, by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or by Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance,\nMerger Sub or wholly-owned subsidiaries of Argo Group or Brookfield Reinsurance or any common share\nthat is subject to an Argo Group equity award) will be converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash,\nwithout interest and less any required withholding tax. All such common shares will no longer be issued and\noutstanding and will be canceled and cease to exist and each holder of a certificate previously evidencing\nany common shares or uncertificated common shares represented by book-entry will cease to have any\nrights with respect to those shares, except the right to receive the merger consideration.\nAt the effective time, Brookfield Reinsurance will become the sole owner of Argo Group\u2019s common\nshares. Therefore, current Argo Group common shareholders will cease to have direct or indirect ownership\ninterests in Argo Group or rights as Argo Group common shareholders, will not participate in any future\nearnings or growth of Argo Group, will not benefit from any appreciation in value of Argo Group and will not\nbear the future risks of Argo Group\u2019s operations.\n57 ",

Reinsurance may\nmake any such request only once in any 10 day period and only once for each such takeover\nproposal and once for each material amendment to such takeover proposal.\nIf Argo Group

agreement and\nterminate the merger agreement if:\nthe Argo Group board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial\nadvisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the\ndirectors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law\u037e\nsuch adverse recommendation change is made or entered into after the fifth

of\nthe merger agreement as would enable the Argo Group board of directors to no longer make an\nadverse recommendation change or a determination that a takeover proposal constitutes a superior\nproposal and (ii) the Argo Group board of directors has determined, after considering the results of\nsuch negotiations and any amendments to the merger agreement committed to in writing by\nBrookfield Reinsurance, if any, after consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,\nthat such superior proposal continues to be a superior proposal.\nIn the event of any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of a superior proposal,\nArgo Group is required to provide an additional written notice to Brookfield Reinsurance and an additional\ntwo business day period to take the actions described in the immediately preceding bullet.\nFor purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d means a bona\nfide takeover proposal with respect to Argo Group:\nthat did not result from a breach by Argo Group of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger\nagreement\u037e\nwhere references to \u201c20%\u201d  (e.g., to outstanding assets or share capital) in the definition of \u201ctakeover\nproposal\u201d are replaced by references to \u201c50%\u201d\u037e\nwhich the Argo Group board of directors has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its\nfinancial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all relevant (in the view of Argo\nGroup\u2019s board of directors) legal, regulatory, financial and other aspects of such proposal (including\nthe conditionality, timing and likelihood of the consummation of such proposal and the payment of\nany termination fee), would be reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed and\nwould be more favorable to the shareholders of Argo Group than the merger.\n64 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nAPPRAISAL RIGHTS\nUnder Bermuda law, and pursuant to Section 106(2)(b)(ii) of the Companies Act, in the event of a merger\nof a Bermuda company with another Bermuda company or foreign corporation, a dissenting shareholder of\nthe Bermuda company is entitled to receive fair value for its shares. For purposes of Section 106(2)(b)(i) of\nthe Companies Act, the Argo Group board of directors determined that the fair value for (i) each common\nshare to be $30.00, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and (ii) each preferred share\n(and the related depositary shares) to be the continuation of each such preferred share as a preferred share\nof Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger, entitled to the same dividend and other\nrelative rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions as are now provided by the certificate of designations\nof Argo Group\u2019s preferred shares, which certificate of designations will remain at and following the\ncompletion of the merger in full force and effect as an obligation of the surviving company in accordance\nwith Section 109(2) of the Companies Act.\nIn accordance with Section 106(2)(b)(ii) of the Companies Act, a dissenting shareholder is entitled to be\npaid the fair value of its shares. Any Argo Group shareholder who is not satisfied that it has been offered fair\nvalue for its shares and whose shares are not voted in favor of the merger proposal may exercise its appraisal\nrights under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act to have the fair value of its shares appraised by the\nBermuda Court, provided that they otherwise fully comply with the requirements of seeking appraisal under\nthe Companies Act. Persons owning beneficial interests in shares but who are not shareholders of record\nshould note that only persons who are shareholders of record are entitled to make an application for\nappraisal. Any Argo Group shareholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must file its application for\nappraisal of the fair value of its shares with the Bermuda Court within one month after the date of the notice\nconvening the special general meeting to approve the merger has been given. The notice delivered with this\nproxy statement constitutes this notice. There are no statutory rules and limited decisions of the Bermuda\nCourt prescribing in detail the operation of the provisions of the Companies Act governing appraisal rights\nthat are set forth in Section 106 of the Companies Act or the process of appraisal by the Bermuda Court\u037e the\nBermuda Court retains considerable discretion as to the precise methodology that it would adopt when\ndetermining the fair value of shares in an appraisal application under the Companies Act.\nIf an Argo Group shareholder votes in favor of the merger proposal at the special general meeting, such\nshareholder will have no right to apply to the Bermuda Court to appraise the fair value of its shares, and\ninstead, if the merger is consummated, and as discussed in the section of this proxy statement titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement - Effects of the Merger,\u201d as applicable, each common share of such shareholder will be\ncanceled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and each preferred share of such\nshareholder will continue as a preferred share of Argo Group as the surviving company following the merger.\nVoting against the merger, or not voting, will not in itself satisfy the requirements for notice and exercise of a\nshareholder\u2019s right to apply for appraisal of the fair value of its shares.\nA FAILURE OF A DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER TO AFFIRMATIVELY VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER\nPROPOSAL WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO HAVE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS\nCOMMON SHARES OR PREFERRED SHARES APPRAISED, PROVIDED THAT SUCH SHAREHOLDER\nDOES NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL.\nIn any case where a registered holder of shares has made an appraisal application, in respect of the\nshares held by such dissenting shareholder, and the merger has been made effective under Bermuda law\nbefore the Bermuda Court\u2019s appraisal of the fair value of such dissenting shares, then the dissenting\nshareholder will be entitled to receive the consideration and, if the fair value of the dissenting shares is later\nappraised by the Bermuda Court to be greater than the value of the consideration, such dissenting\nshareholder will be paid the difference, between the amount paid to him as the consideration and the value\nappraised by the court within one month of the Bermuda Court\u2019s appraisal.\nIn any case where the value of the dissenting shares held by a dissenting shareholder is appraised by\nthe Bermuda Court before the merger has been made effective under Bermuda law, then the surviving\ncompany will be required to pay the dissenting shareholder within one month of the Bermuda Court\u2019s\nappraisal an amount equal to the value of the dissenting shares appraised by the Bermuda Court, unless the\nmerger is terminated under the terms of the merger agreement, in which case no payment will be made.\nHowever, it is anticipated that the merger would have proceeded prior to the appraisal by the Bermuda Court.\n87 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nA shareholder that has exercised appraisal rights has no right of appeal from an appraisal made by the\nBermuda Court. The responsibility for apportioning the costs of any application to the Bermuda Court under\nSection 106 of the Companies Act will be in the discretion of the Bermuda Court.\nThe relevant portion of Section 106 of the Companies Act in relation to appraisal rights is as follows:\n\u201c(6) Any shareholder who did not vote in favor of the amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied\nthat he has been offered fair value for his shares may within one month of the giving of the notice referred to\nin subsection (2) apply to the Court to appraise the fair value of his shares.\n(6A) Subject to subsection (6B), within one month of the Court appraising the fair value of any shares\nunder subsection (6) the company shall be entitled either -\n(a) to pay to the dissenting shareholder an amount equal to the value of his shares as appraised by\nthe Court\u037e or\n(b) to terminate the amalgamation or merger in accordance with subsection (7).\n(6B) Where the Court has appraised any shares under subsection (6) and the amalgamation or merger\nhas proceeded prior to the appraisal then, within one month of the Court appraising the value of the shares,\nif the amount paid to the dissenting shareholder for his shares is less than that appraised by the Court, the\namalgamated or surviving company shall pay to such shareholder the difference between the amount paid to\nhim and the value appraised by the Court.\n(6C) No appeal shall lie from an appraisal by the Court under this section.\n(6D) The costs of any application to the Court under this section shall be in the discretion of the Court.\n(7) An amalgamation agreement or merger agreement may provide that at any time before the issue of a\ncertificate of amalgamation or merger the agreement may be terminated by the directors of an amalgamating\nor merging company, notwithstanding approval of the agreement by the shareholders of all or any of the\namalgamating or merging companies.\u201d\nSHAREHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER\nNOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR\nBANKS BROKERAGE FIRMS AND OTHER NOMINEES AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE\nPROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND\nFOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE ARGO GROUP COMMON SHARES OR PREFERRED SHARES. A PERSON\nHAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON,\nSUCH AS A BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM AND OTHER NOMINEE MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE\nRECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO\nPERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nA shareholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act should\nmail or deliver a written demand to:\nArgo Group International Holdings, Ltd. \nAttention: Corporate Secretary \nWellesley House \n90 Pitts Bay Road \nPembroke HM 08, Bermuda\n88 \n",

Subject to the discussion titled \u201c- Passive Foreign\nInvestment Company,\u201d a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nupon the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for common shares in an amount equal to the\ndifference, if any, between the cash received and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the common shares\nexchanged. Subject to the discussion titled \u201c- Related Person Insurance Income,\u201d such gain or loss will be\ncapital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss provided that a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for\nsuch common shares exceeds one year on the date of the exchange. Long-term capital gains recognized by\ncertain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Any such capital gain or loss recognized by\nU.S. holders generally will be treated as U.S.-source gain or loss.\nIf a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common shares at different times or at different prices, such\nU.S. holder must determine its, his or her gain or loss, adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with\nrespect to each block of common shares.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company (\u201cPFIC\u201d)\nIn general, a foreign corporation will be treated as a PFIC during a given year if either (1) 75% or more of\nits gross income constitutes passive income or (2) 50% or more of its assets produce, or are held for the\nproduction of, passive income (\u201cpassive assets\u201d). For these purposes, passive income includes interest,\ndividends and other investment income, with certain exceptions, and certain look-through rules apply with\nrespect to interests in subsidiaries. However, under an \u201cactive insurance\u201d exception in the Code and\napplicable regulations, passive income does not include any income derived in the active conduct of an\ninsurance business by a qualifying insurance corporation (\u201cQIC\u201d) or any income of a qualifying domestic\ninsurance corporation (\u201cQDIC\u201d), and passive assets do not include assets of a QIC available to satisfy\nliabilities of the QIC related to its insurance business, if the QIC is engaged in the active conduct of an\ninsurance business, or assets of a QDIC.\nArgo Group does not believe that it is, or ever has been, a PFIC. This is based in part on the belief that\nthe income and assets of certain of Argo Group\u2019s subsidiaries qualifies for the active insurance exception.\nThe statute commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Public Law No: 115-97) modified certain\nprovisions relating to PFIC status that makes it more difficult for a non-U.S. insurance company to qualify\nunder the above-mentioned active insurance exception. Although Argo Group believes that it has qualified\nfor the active insurance exception as amended, we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with this\nconclusion. In addition, the determination of PFIC status is factual in nature, depends on the application of\ncomplex U.S. federal income tax rules that are subject to differing interpretations, and generally cannot be\ndetermined until the close of the taxable year in question. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Argo\nGroup is or was not a PFIC for its current or any prior taxable year.\nIf Argo Group were a PFIC for the taxable year of the merger or any prior taxable year in which the U.S.\nholder held common shares, unless the U.S. holder had certain timely and effective elections in place with\nrespect to their common shares, any gain recognized by a U.S. holder on the exchange of common shares for\nthe merger consideration pursuant to the merger generally would be allocated ratably over such U.S. holder\u2019s\nholding period for the common shares. The amount allocated to the taxable year of the merger and to any\ntaxable year before Argo Group became a PFIC would be treated as ordinary income. The amount allocated to\neach other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for that year and the interest\n98 ",
