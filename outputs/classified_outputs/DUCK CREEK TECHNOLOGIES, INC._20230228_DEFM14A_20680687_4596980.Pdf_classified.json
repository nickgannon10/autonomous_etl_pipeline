Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege\nthat the proxy statement filed by Duck Creek with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger\n(referred to as the \u201cPreliminary Proxy Statement\u201d) contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and\ninformation concerning the Company\u2019s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and\nEvercore in support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into\nbetween Duck Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek\nand potential conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the\nComplaints includes enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain\nallegedly material information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the\nterms thereof, granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not\ncontain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required or necessary material facts, directing the\ndefendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing, declaring\nthat defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated\nthereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and\nexperts\u2019 fees and expenses.\nDuck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend\nto defend against the Complaints\u037e however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be\nrequired to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or\ndelay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with\nthe indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the\nMerger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered\nenforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation\nof the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the\nMerger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from\nbeing consummated within the expected time frame.\n \n8TABLE OF CONTENTS",

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved\nby the requisite number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under the\nMerger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Duck Creek, with Duck\nCreek continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek\nexpects to delist the Duck Creek Common Stock from Nasdaq and de-register the Duck Creek Common Stock\nunder the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Duck Creek would no longer\nbe a publicly traded company, and Duck Creek will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of\nDuck Creek Common Stock.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is consummated?\nA:\nUpon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $19.00 in\ncash, without interest, for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock that you own, unless you have properly\nexercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares.

In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the\nMerger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Board was aware\nof and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in\nevaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the\nMerger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. For a\ndescription of the interests of Duck Creek\u2019s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section\nentitled \u201cThe Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 72 of this Proxy Statement.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain\ncompensation arrangements for Duck Creek\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nUnder SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the\nMerger, commonly referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation. If the Merger Agreement is approved and\nadopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation may be paid to the\nCompany\u2019s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and\narrangements even if the Company stockholders fail to approve this proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested\nCompany RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the\nholders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company\nRSAs, present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon at the Special\nMeeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a\n \n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnon-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck\nCreek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d such proposal is greater than fifty\npercent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company\nstockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special\nMeeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will\nnot count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.\nAs of February 9, 2023, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there\nwere 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special\nMeeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested\nCompany RSAs.

As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your\nvoting rights directly to Duck Creek or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.\nIf your shares are held through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner\nof those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or\nother nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record.

Attending the Special\nMeeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote\nby virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.\nYour latest dated proxy card, Internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.\nIf your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting\ninstructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.\nQ:\nIf a Company stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your\nproxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate.

However,\nif you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee\nwith respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those shares will be\nvoted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given and will not be voted with\nrespect to any other proposal.\nQ:\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum?\nA:\nThe presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the\nSpecial Meeting constitutes a quorum.

If you\nsubmit a properly executed proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In\naddition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be\ncounted for purposes of establishing a quorum\u037e however, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting\ninstructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, then those shares\nwill be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. As\na result, 68,453,220 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not present,\nthe holders of a majority in voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, and\nentitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to\nDuck Creek\u2019s bylaws.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain a proxy card?\nA:\nIf you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.\nFor Company stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 717-3923 (toll-free from\nthe U.S. and Canada) or +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).\nFor holders in \u201cstreet name\u201d: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar\ninstitution.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of\nbusiness on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be\nconsummated.

Morgan to contact approximately 17 strategic and financial parties, including\nVista, PE Firm A, Company A, PE Firm B, PE Firm C and PE Firm D, to assess (or follow up on, in the case of potential\ncounterparties who had already been in contact with the Company) their interest in exploring a potential strategic\ntransaction involving the Company. During that period, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes also met with a number of\nthose potential counterparties to discuss at a high level the Company\u2019s business and, on a preliminary and high-level\nbasis, the party\u2019s interest in a potential transaction involving the Company.

The parties present at the meeting did not discuss PE Firm A\u2019s preliminary views in\ndetail\u037e however, Mr. Wright and the J.P. Morgan representatives informed PE Firm A that although the Board had not\npreviously discussed any potential offer price, it was their expectation that an offer price would need to be\nsignificantly higher than $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock in order for the Board to consider a sale of\nthe Company. The parties present at the meeting discussed at a high level, among other things, that, if the Company\nand Company A were to combine, they would together be able to make larger investments in product development.\nNo other terms of any potential transaction, business plans or financial or other analyses or proposals were\ndiscussed.\nOn November 16, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with representatives of PE Firm C.

Morgan verbally of their preliminary interest in jointly pursuing a strategic transaction with the\nCompany, together with one of their shared portfolio companies, and provided J.P.

During the meeting, Mr. Wright informed the Transaction\nCommittee that, subject to Apax\u2019s investment committee\u2019s approval, a different Apax fund than the fund owning\nDuck Creek Common Stock might be interested in investing in the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving\nthe Company if the Board determined to pursue a sale of the Company to PE Firm A and Company A (but would not\nbe interested in investing in a buyer group with any other potential counterparty), which interest was new and\ntherefore had not previously been raised with the Transaction Committee or the Board. Mr. Wright further informed\nthe Transaction Committee that PE Firm A was not yet aware of such Apax fund\u2019s potential interest and that there had\nnot been any discussions between Apax and PE Firm A regarding the potential participation of an Apax fund as an\ninvestor in such a transaction. Mr. Wright further informed the other members of the Transaction Committee that\nApax\u2019s investment committee was scheduled to discuss the matter on December 5, 2022, and that Mr. Wright would\nupdate the full Board on Apax\u2019s decision, so that the Board could, if appropriate, determine to implement any\nappropriate decision-making procedures (including the potential recusal of Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie, the Apax-\nnominated directors on the Board, from a strategic alternatives review process). During the meeting, Skadden\nrepresentatives reviewed with the Transaction Committee the fiduciary duties of directors when considering a change\nin control transaction, recent trends in regulatory review of mergers and acquisitions, and procedural protections the\nBoard could consider if certain directors had interests in a potential transaction that differed from the interests of the\nCompany\u2019s other stockholders.\nOn December 1, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board, except Mr. Rajasekar, and\nrepresentatives of J.P.

Morgan representatives updated\nthe Board on the status of the outreaches to potential counterparties and the non-binding indications of interest that\nhad been received to date.

During the meeting, the Board instructed Mr. Jackowski to, and to cause\nmanagement to, refrain from engaging in any discussions with potential counterparties with respect to any post-\nclosing employment or equity participation, none of which had occurred to date.

On February 23, 2023 a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the Powell Complaint, naming\nas defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.\nThe Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege\nthat the Preliminary Proxy Statement contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and information\nconcerning the Company\u2019s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore in\nsupport of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into between Duck\nCreek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek and potential\nconflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the Complaints includes\nenjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material\ninformation, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms thereof,\ngranting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to\n \n80\n TABLE OF CONTENTS\ndisseminate a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required\nor necessary material facts, directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the\ndefendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing, declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act\nas well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements,\nincluding reasonable attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees and expenses.\nDuck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend\nto defend against the Complaints\u037e however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be\nrequired to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.\nThe outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or\ndelay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with\nthe indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the\nMerger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered\nenforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation\nof the Merger.

Unless the Court of\nChancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue\nand compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period\u037e\nprovided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving\nCorporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of\nsuch payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and\nthe \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of\nsuch voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such\nvoluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking\nappraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more\nthan, the same as or less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement\nif they did not seek appraisal of their shares.\nUnder Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to\nappraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information\ndirecting the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without\nsubscription or cost. This Proxy Statement constitutes Duck Creek\u2019s notice to Company stockholders that appraisal\nrights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed,\nwithout subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:\nhttps://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the Merger, any holder or beneficial\nowner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve\nsuch person\u2019s right to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully.\nFailure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of\nappraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all\nCompany stockholders and beneficial owners who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of\nDuck Creek Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent (1%) of\nthe outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock for which appraisal rights have been\n106TABLE OF CONTENTS\npursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek\nappraisal of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, Duck Creek believes that if a Company stockholder or beneficial\nowner is considering exercising appraisal rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel. A Company\nstockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger\nConsideration as described in the Merger Agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented\nsuch shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.\nCompany stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of\nDuck Creek Common Stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\nthe person must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must deliver to Duck Creek a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to adopt\nthe Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and\nseparate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement.\nVoting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a\ndemand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform\nus of the identity of the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, and the intention of such person to\ndemand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder\u2019s or beneficial owner's failure to make a written\ndemand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of\nappraisal rights\u037e\n\u2022\nthe person must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective\nTime (a stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers\nthe shares before the Effective Time)\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal rights or the\nSurviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving\nCorporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.\nIf you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive\nthe Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock.\nBecause a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in\nfavor of proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise\nappraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement, abstain or not vote its shares.\nMaking a Written Demand",

If a petition for\nappraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The Surviving Corporation is under no\nobligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and Company stockholders and beneficial owners\nshould not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the\nfair values of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek\nCommon Stock who desire to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be\nresponsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The\nfailure of a holder or beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common Stock to file such a petition for appraisal within the\nperiod specified in Section 262 will nullify the person\u2019s previous written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck\nCreek Common Stock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, will be entitled,\nupon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of\nshares not voted in favor of the Merger proposal and with respect to which Duck Creek received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares of such\ncommon stock (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such person's name, the record\nholder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such\naggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting person within ten (10) days\nafter receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for\ndelivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock\nand a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within\ntwenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all persons who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to\nthe value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders and beneficial owners as required\nby the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons\nwho have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of\nChancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to\ncomply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.",

UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be\nconsidered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or\nmethods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d\nshould be considered, and that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the\nvalue of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court\nmust consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other\nfacts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged\ncorporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Court\nof Chancery may consider in determining \u201cfair value\u201d and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction\nprice should be given \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element\nof value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known\nelements of value,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such\naccomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future\nvalue, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and\nnot the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their\nshares as so determined by the Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration\nthey would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an\ninvestment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is\nnot an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Duck\nCreek believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of\nfair value as determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders and beneficial owners should recognize that\nsuch an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger\nConsideration. Neither Duck Creek nor Parent anticipates offering more than the $19.00 per share Merger\nConsideration to any person exercising appraisal rights. Each of Duck Creek and Parent reserves the right to assert, in\nany appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of Duck Creek Common Stock\nis less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration.\nUnless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the\nEffective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five\npercent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during\nthe period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment\u037e provided that if at any time before\nthe Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to each\nstockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the\namount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares\nas determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment,\nunless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment\nprior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the\nfees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of\nChancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may\nalso order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,\nwithout limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to be appraised not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to\nsuch an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.\nIf any stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Duck Creek Common\nStock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person\u2019s right to appraisal, the\nperson\u2019s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the\nMerger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw,\nthe person\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred\n110\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntwenty (120) days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, delivers to the\nSurviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person\u2019s demand for appraisal in respect to some or all of such\nperson\u2019s shares and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares subject to withdrawal in\naccordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Duck\nCreek Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except\ndividends or other distributions on the person\u2019s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, if any, payable to Company\nstockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of statutory\nappraisal rights. Consequently, any Company stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is\nencouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\nSTOCKHOLDERS AND BENEFICIAL OWNERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF\nTHE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT\nTHERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.\nOTHER MATTERS",

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), among the Company,\nthe Acquiror and its subsidiary, Disco Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), the Company will\nbecome a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other\nthan shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or owned by\nthe Acquiror, Merger Sub and any of their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and Dissenting Company\nShares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $19.00 per share in cash (the\n\u201cConsideration\u201d).\nIn connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated January 8, 2023 of the Agreement\u037e\n(ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries\nin which it operates\u037e (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available\nfinancial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such\ncompanies\u037e (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available\ninformation concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market\nprices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies\u037e (v) reviewed\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its\nbusiness\u037e and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we\ndeemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.\nIn addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to\ncertain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial\ncondition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or\nappropriate to our inquiry.\nIn giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that\nwas publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us.\nWe have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our\nengagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent\nverification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor\nhave we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to\nbankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
