as the Merger Agreement is\nvalidly terminated (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cExpiration Time\u201d), at every meeting of Globus stockholders at which the Globus Share\nIssuance Proposal is to be voted on (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and on any action or approval of Globus stockholders by\nwritten consent with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the Supporting Stockholders are required to vote all of their shares of Globus\nCommon Stock in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal as of the time of the\nGlobus Special Meeting.\nUntil the Expiration Time, at every meeting of Globus stockholders (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), the Supporting\nStockholders are

As of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, the shares of Globus Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement represent approximately 70% of the total voting power\nof outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock. Even though a special meeting is required to be held and all Globus stockholders of record on the\nGlobus Record Date have a right to vote on the proposals presented at the Globus Special Meeting, the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock\nsubject to the Voting Agreement will be sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.\n \n-15-\nTable of Contents\nFor more information, see the section titled \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d and Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 160)\nNuVasive and Globus intend for the Merger to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.

Both Globus and NuVasive are Delaware corporations, but there are certain differences in the\nrights of Globus stockholders under the Globus charter and Globus bylaws and of NuVasive stockholders under the NuVasive charter and NuVasive\nbylaws. See the section titled \u201cComparison of Stockholders\u2019 Rights.\u201d\nListing of Globus Common Stock\u037e Delisting and Deregistration of NuVasive Common Stock (Page 110)\nIt is a condition to the Merger that the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock to be issued to NuVasive stockholders in the Merger be\napproved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. If the Merger is completed, NuVasive Common Stock will be delisted from\nNasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, following which NuVasive will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with\nrespect to NuVasive Common Stock.\nRisk Factors (Page 22)\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the Share Issuance you should carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and\ngive special consideration to the factors discussed in the section titled \u201cRisk  \nFactors.\u201d\n \n-16-\nTable of Contents\nLitigation Relating to the Merger (Page 110) \nAs of March 23, 2023 and since the filing of the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus on March 13, 2023, NuVasive and its directors\nhave been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by a purported NuVasive stockholder alleging that the defendants filed or caused to be filed a\nmaterially incomplete and misleading preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, including to enjoin the\nMerger, rescission of the Merger Agreement or rescissory damages in the event the Merger is consummated, and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, in\naddition to other relief. NuVasive and Globus believe that the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit. See \u201cThe Merger\u2014Litigation Relating\nto the Merger.\u201d\n \n-17-\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "Risks Relating to the Merger\nThe Exchange Ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either Globus\u2019s or NuVasive\u2019s stock price. Therefore, NuVasive\nshareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of NuVasive Common Stock (other than cancelled shares) will be converted\ninto the right to receive the merger consideration, which is equal to 0.75 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Globus Class A Common Stock (and, if\napplicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares) (subject to adjustments in the event of any stock split or similar change to the number of shares of NuVasive\nCommon Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of specified events, as specified in the\nMerger Agreement). This Exchange Ratio was fixed in the Merger Agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either NuVasive\nCommon Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock. Any change in the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock prior to completion of the Merger\ncould affect the value of the Merger Consideration that NuVasive stockholders will receive upon completion of the Merger.\nIt is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock at the completion of the Merger and, therefore, impossible\nto accurately predict the market value of the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock that NuVasive stockholders will receive in the Merger. The market\nprice for Globus Class A Common Stock may fluctuate both prior to the completion of the Merger and thereafter for a variety of reasons, including, among\nothers, general market and economic conditions, the demand for Globus\u2019s or NuVasive\u2019s products and services, changes in laws and regulations, other\nchanges in Globus\u2019s or NuVasive\u2019s respective businesses, operations, prospects and financial results of operations, market assessments of the likelihood\nthat the Merger will be completed, and the expected timing of the Merger. Many of these factors are beyond Globus\u2019s and NuVasive\u2019s control. As a result,\nthe market value represented by the Exchange Ratio will also vary.\nYou are urged to obtain current market quotations for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock and NuVasive Common Stock. The market price of\nGlobus Class A Common Stock will continue to fluctuate after the Merger.\nUpon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will become holders of Globus Class A Common Stock. The market price of the Globus\nClass A Common Stock will continue to fluctuate, potentially significantly, following completion of the Merger, including for the reasons described above.\nAs a result, former NuVasive stockholders could lose some or all of the value of their investment in Globus Class A Common Stock. In addition, any\nsignificant price or volume fluctuations in the stock market generally could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the Globus\nClass A Common Stock received in the Merger, regardless of the Combined Company\u2019s actual operating performance.\n \n-22-Table of Contents\nThe Merger may not be completed and the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied (or waived, to the extent permitted), including (i) the adoption of the Merger\nAgreement by NuVasive stockholders\u037e (ii) approval by Globus stockholders of the issuance of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in connection\nwith the Merger\u037e (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Merger\u037e (iv) this registration statement on Form S-4 having been\ndeclared effective by the SEC\u037e (v) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act\u037e (vi) with\nrespect to a party, accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger\nAgreement\u037e (vii) compliance by each party in all material respects with such other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement\u037e and (viii) with respect\nto a party, the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party since February 8, 2023. These conditions are described in the section titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger.\u201d These conditions to the completion of the Merger, some of which are beyond the\ncontrol of Globus and NuVasive, may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or not\ncompleted.\nAdditionally, either Globus or NuVasive may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, subject to the payment of a termination\nfee in certain cases. The Merger Agreement provides that NuVasive will pay Globus a termination fee of:\n \n\u2022\n$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Globus, at any time prior to obtaining the NuVasive Stockholder Approval, as a result\nof NuVasive committing an intentional and material breach of its non-solicitation or board recommendation obligations as described in the\nsections \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Obligations to Recommend the Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Globus\nShare Issuance Proposal\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\n$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Globus, at any time prior to obtaining the NuVasive Stockholder Approval, as a result\nof the NuVasive Board or any committee thereof (A) making an adverse recommendation change with respect to the NuVasive Merger\nProposal, (B) not including the recommendation of the NuVasive Board in this joint proxy

adverse recommendation change by the NuVasive Board.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that Globus will pay NuVasive a termination fee of:\n \n\u2022\n$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by NuVasive, at any time prior to obtaining the Globus Stockholder Approval, as a result\nof Globus committing an intentional and material breach of its non-solicitation obligations as described in

not including the recommendation of the Globus Board in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus or (C) publicly proposing or allowing Globus to publicly propose to take any of the actions in clause (A) or (B) of this\nbullet point\u037e\n \n\u2022\n$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Globus, at any time prior to obtaining the Globus Stockholder approval for the Globus\nShare Issuance Proposal, in order to enter into a definitive agreement with a third party providing for a Globus Superior Proposal\u037e and\n \n-23-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\n$120 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either Globus or NuVasive if the Globus Stockholder Approval is not obtained.\nSee the sections titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees\u201d for a\nmore complete discussion of the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement could be terminated and when a termination fee may be payable by\nGlobus or NuVasive.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the future business and financial results of Globus and NuVasive and the trading prices of\nthe Globus Class A Common Stock or NuVasive Common Stock.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including because Globus stockholders fail to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, or\nbecause NuVasive stockholders fail to approve the NuVasive Merger Proposal, the ongoing businesses of Globus and NuVasive may be adversely\naffected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the Merger, Globus and NuVasive would be subject to a number of risks,\nincluding the following:\n \n\u2022\neach company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach company may experience negative reactions from its customers, partners, suppliers and employees\u037e\n \n\u2022\neach company will have incurred substantial costs towards completion of the Merger and will generally be required to pay its respective\ncosts relating to the Merger, such as financial advisory, legal, accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the\nMerger is completed\u037e\n \n\u2022\nthere may be disruptions to each company\u2019s respective business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, and any\nadverse changes in their relationships with their respective customers, partners, suppliers, surgeons, other business partners, contractors\nand employees may continue or intensify\u037e and\n \n\u2022\neach company will have committed substantial time and resources to matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) which\nwould otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either company as\nan independent company.\nThe market price for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have\naffected or currently affect the market price of shares of NuVasive Common Stock.\nUpon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock and will accordingly become Globus\nstockholders. Globus\u2019s business differs from that of NuVasive, and Globus\u2019s results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected by factors\ndifferent from those that historically have affected or currently affect NuVasive\u2019s results of operations and stock price. Following the completion of the\nMerger, NuVasive will be part of a larger company, so decisions affecting NuVasive may be made in respect of the larger combined business as a whole\nrather than the NuVasive business individually. For a discussion of the businesses of each of Globus and NuVasive and some important factors to\nconsider in connection with those businesses, see the section titled \u201cThe Parties to the Merger\u201d and the other information contained or incorporated in\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section titled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe Share Issuance may cause the market price of Globus Class A Common Stock to decline.\nBased on 52,348,291 shares of NuVasive Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March 3, 2023, and the Exchange Ratio, it is expected that\nGlobus will issue approximately 39.3 million shares of Globus Class A\n \n-24-\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock in the Merger. Former NuVasive stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock that they will receive in\nthe Merger, and Globus stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in Globus as a result of the changes to Globus\u2019s investment profile as a result\nof the Merger. Both the issuance of this amount of new shares in the Merger and any subsequent sales of these shares may cause the market price of\nGlobus Class A Common Stock to decline.\nNuVasive stockholders who receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in the Merger will have rights as Globus stockholders that differ from\ntheir current rights as NuVasive stockholders.\nUpon completion of the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will no longer be stockholders of NuVasive and will instead become stockholders of\nGlobus. Both Globus and NuVasive are Delaware corporations, but there are certain differences in the rights of Globus stockholders under the Globus\ncharter and Globus bylaws and of NuVasive stockholders under the NuVasive charter and NuVasive bylaws. See the section titled \u201cComparison of\nStockholders\u2019 Rights\u201d for a discussion of these rights.\nAfter the Merger, NuVasive stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in Globus than they currently have in NuVasive\nand will exercise less influence over management and policies of the Combined Company.\nEach share of Globus Class B Common Stock has ten votes per share while each share of Globus Class A Common Stock has one vote per share.\nNuVasive stockholders will have the right to receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in the Merger and based on the number of shares of Globus\nClass A Common Stock and Globus Class B Common Stock outstanding on March 3, 2023, and the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock\noutstanding on March 3, 2023, upon completion of the Merger, former NuVasive stockholders are expected to own approximately 28% of the voting power\nof the issued and outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock and current Globus stockholders are expected to own approximately 72% of the voting\npower of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock. Consequently, former NuVasive stockholders will have less influence over the\nmanagement and policies of the Combined Company than they currently have over the management and policies of NuVasive.\nAfter the Merger, Globus stockholders and NuVasive stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the Combined Company and\nmay not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with their ownership dilution.\nThe Merger will dilute the ownership position of Globus stockholders and result in NuVasive stockholders having an ownership stake in the\nCombined Company. Upon completion of the Merger, each NuVasive stockholder will become a stockholder of Globus with a percentage ownership of the\nCombined Company that is smaller than such stockholder\u2019s current percentage ownership of NuVasive. It is expected that the former stockholders of\nNuVasive as a group will receive shares in the Merger constituting approximately 28% of the issued and outstanding shares of Globus common stock\nimmediately after the Merger. Furthermore, because shares of Globus Class A Common Stock will be issued to existing NuVasive stockholders, current\nGlobus stockholders will have their ownership diluted by approximately 11%.\nIf the Combined Company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, Globus stockholders\nand NuVasive stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies, without receiving any\ncommensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the Combined Company is able to realize only part of the strategic\nand financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nThe Combined Company will have a controlling stockholder.\nAs of March 3, 2023, approximately 74% of the outstanding voting power of Globus Common Stock is currently held by David C. Paul, the\nExecutive Chairman of Globus, and certain of his affiliates, including the\n \n-25-\nTable of Contents\nother Supporting Stockholder, and following consummation of the Merger, Mr. Paul and his affiliates are expected to hold approximately 66% of the\noutstanding voting power of the Combined Company. Because of their significant stock ownership, Mr. Paul and his affiliates will be able to exert\nsubstantial control over the Combined Company and its significant corporate decisions. The interests of Mr. Paul and his affiliates might not coincide\nwith the interests of the other holders of capital stock of Globus, including NuVasive stockholders who receive Globus Class A Common Stock in the\nMerger. This concentration of ownership may harm the value of the Globus Class A Common Stock NuVasive stockholders receive in the Merger by,\namong other things delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Globus, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business\ntransaction involving Globus, or causing Globus to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nFollowing the Merger, Globus is expected to continue to be a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Under NYSE rules, a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may elect not to\ncomply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that a majority of its directors be independent, as defined in NYSE\nrules, and the requirement that its compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees consist entirely of independent directors. Globus\nrelies, and may continue to rely, on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under NYSE rules. As a result, a majority of the members of its board may not be\nindependent directors and its nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees may not consist entirely of independent directors.\nAccordingly, while Globus remains a controlled company and during any transition period following a time when it is no longer a controlled company,\nholders of Globus Common Stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of NYSE\u2019s corporate\ngovernance requirements.\nUntil the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms, Globus and NuVasive are each prohibited from\nentering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to Globus, NuVasive and/or their respective\nstockholders.\nFrom and after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant\nto its terms, the Merger Agreement restricts Globus and NuVasive from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party and requires that\nthe businesses of Globus, NuVasive and their respective subsidiaries be conducted in the ordinary course. These restrictions may prevent Globus or\nNuVasive, as applicable, from taking actions during the pendency of the Merger that would have been beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these\nrestrictions during the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger\nAgreement. See the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.\u201d\nObtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the Merger, and regulatory approval may not be\nreceived, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others,\n(1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by NuVasive stockholders\u037e (2) approval by Globus stockholders of the issuance of shares of Globus Class A\nCommon Stock in connection with the Merger\u037e (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting consummation of the Merger\u037e (4) this registration\nstatement on Form S-4 having been declared effective by the SEC\u037e (5) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension\nthereof) under the HSR Act\u037e (6) with respect to a party, accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality\nstandards set forth in the Merger Agreement\u037e (7) with respect to a party, compliance by the other party in all material respects with such other party\u2019s\nobligations under the Merger Agreement\u037e and (8) with respect to a party, the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party since February 8,\n2023. No assurance can be given that the required stockholder approvals and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any\nextension thereof) under the HSR Act can be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required approvals are\nobtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the\n \n-26-\nTable of Contents\nterms, conditions and timing of such approvals. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the Combined Company not to realize, or to be delayed\nin realizing, some or all of the benefits that Globus and NuVasive expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nFor a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to completion of the Merger, see the sections titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Approvals.\u201d\nFailure to attract, motivate and retain executives and other key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend in part on the Combined Company\u2019s ability to retain the talents and dedication of the professionals\ncurrently employed by Globus and NuVasive. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Globus or NuVasive, as applicable, while\nthe Merger is pending, or with the Combined Company. If key employees of either company terminate their employment, or if an insufficient number of\nemployees or sales representatives are retained to maintain effective operations, the Combined Company\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected\nand management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Globus and NuVasive to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause\nthe Combined Company\u2019s business to suffer. In addition, Globus and NuVasive may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees\nthat leave either company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms. Moreover, there could be disruptions to or distractions for\nthe workforce and management, including disruptions associated with integrating employees into the Combined Company. No assurance can be given\nthat the Combined Company will be able to attract or retain key employees of Globus and NuVasive to the same extent that those companies have been\nable to attract or retain their own employees in the past.\nThe Merger, and uncertainty regarding the Merger, may cause business partners, surgeons, vendors or other stakeholders to delay or defer decisions\nconcerning Globus or NuVasive and adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to effectively manage its respective business, which could adversely\naffect each company\u2019s business, operating results and financial position and, following the completion of the Merger, the Combined Company\u2019s\nbusiness, operating results and financial position.\nThe Merger will happen only if the stated conditions are met, including the approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the approval of the\nNuVasive Merger Proposal and the receipt of the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act\ncan be obtained, among other conditions. Many of the conditions are beyond the control of Globus and NuVasive, and both parties also have certain\nrights to terminate the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the Merger. This uncertainty may cause\nexisting or prospective business partners, surgeons, vendors and other stakeholders, including sales representatives, to:\n \n\u2022\ndelay or defer other decisions concerning Globus, NuVasive or the Combined Company, including entering into contracts with Globus or\nNuVasive or making other decisions concerning Globus or NuVasive or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with Globus\nor NuVasive\u037e or\n \n\u2022\notherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with Globus, NuVasive or the Combined Company.\nAny such disruptions such as delays or deferrals of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could adversely affect the respective\nbusiness, operating results and financial position of Globus and NuVasive, whether the Merger is ultimately completed, and following the completion of\nthe Merger, the Combined Company, including an adverse effect on the Combined Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated synergies and other\nbenefits of the Merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of any such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination\nof the Merger Agreement.\n \n-27-\nTable of Contents\nWhether or not the Merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of Globus and\nNuVasive, which could have an adverse effect on their respective businesses and financial results.\nWhether or not the Merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in the businesses of Globus and\nNuVasive, including by diverting the attention of Globus and NuVasive\u2019s respective management and employee teams, such as those involved in day-to-\nday operations and sales, toward the completion of the Merger. In addition, Globus and NuVasive have each diverted significant management resources\nin an effort to complete the Merger and are each subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of their respective businesses.\nIf the Merger is not completed, Globus and NuVasive will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which\nthey will have received little or no benefit.\nNuVasive directors and executive officers have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to, those of NuVasive\nstockholders generally.\nWhen considering the recommendations of the NuVasive Board on how to vote on the proposals described in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, NuVasive stockholders should be aware that NuVasive\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of NuVasive stockholders generally. These interests include, among others, acceleration of the equity awards held\nby NuVasive non-employee directors upon the consummation of the Merger, \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d vesting of NuVasive equity awards and severance benefits\nin the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the Merger, participation in the NuVasive Excise Tax Gross-Up Plan, Globus\u2019s\nagreement to add three current members of the NuVasive Board to the Globus Board and rights to continuing indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019\nliability insurance. The NuVasive Board was aware of and considered these interests when it determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of NuVasive and its stockholders, and recommended that\nNuVasive stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. The interests of NuVasive directors and executive officers are described in more detail in the section\ntitled \u201cInterests of NuVasive Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire or\nmerge with either Globus or NuVasive.\nThe Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict the ability of Globus and NuVasive to, among other things (each as\ndescribed in the sections titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation\u201d), subject to limited exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement:\n \n\u2022\nin the case of NuVasive: (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate or take any other action that is reasonably expected\nto promote, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be\nexpected to lead to, a NuVasive Acquisition Proposal\u037e (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-\npublic information or data relating to, NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of NuVasive, or\nany of its subsidiaries to any person that has made or could reasonably be expected to make, or in connection with, a NuVasive Acquisition\nProposal\u037e or (iii) enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger\nagreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement, with respect to a NuVasive Acquisition Proposal.\n \n\u2022\nin the case of Globus: (i) initiate, seek or solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate or take any other action that is reasonably expected to\npromote, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected\nto lead to, a Globus Acquisition Proposal\u037e (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any non-public\ninformation or data relating to, Globus or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Globus, or any of its\nsubsidiaries to any person that has made or could\n \n-28-\nTable of Contents\nreasonably be expected to make, or in connection with, a Globus Acquisition Proposal\u037e or (iii) enter into any agreement, including any letter\nof intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement, with\nrespect to a Globus Acquisition Proposal.\nFurthermore, there are limited exceptions to the requirement under the Merger Agreement that neither the Globus Board nor the NuVasive Board\nwithdraw or modify the Globus Board Recommendation or the NuVasive Board Recommendation, as applicable (see the section titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Obligations to Recommend the Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Globus Share Issuance Proposal \u201d). Although\nthe Globus Board or NuVasive Board is permitted to effect a change of recommendation, after complying with certain procedures set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, in response to certain superior offers or if the applicable board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel,\nthat a failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, such change of recommendation would entitle the other party\nto terminate the Merger Agreement and receive a termination fee from the party making a change of recommendation. See the sections titled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement\u2014Termination of the Merger Agreement\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees.\u201d\nThese provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer from considering or proposing an acquisition or merger, even if it were prepared\nto pay consideration with a higher value than that implied by the merger consideration in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer\nproposing to pay a lower per share price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.\nGlobus and NuVasive expect to incur substantial costs related to the Merger and integration.\nGlobus and NuVasive have incurred and expect to incur non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as\nwell as transaction fees and other costs related to the Merger. Such costs include, among others, filing and registration fees with the SEC, printing and\nmailing costs associated with this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and legal, accounting, investment banking, consulting, public relations and proxy\nsolicitation fees. Some of these costs are payable by Globus or NuVasive regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nThe Combined Company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the Merger. There are processes, policies,\nprocedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Merger and the integration of NuVasive\u2019s business into\nthe Combined Company. Although Globus expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits and additional income, as well as the\nrealization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, Merger-related and restructuring costs\nover time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. While Globus has assumed that certain expenses would be incurred in connection\nwith the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond Globus\u2019s control that could affect the\ntotal amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.\nNeither Globus stockholders nor NuVasive stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights in the Merger.\nAppraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders of a corporation to dissent from certain extraordinary\ntransactions, such as a merger in certain circumstances, and to demand that such corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court\nin a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to such stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the\nDGCL, stockholders generally do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of\nrecord by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the terms of the Merger\nAgreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that\nwill either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares or (d) any\ncombination of the foregoing.\n \n-29-\nTable of Contents\nBecause the Merger consists of Merger Sub merging with and into NuVasive, holders of Globus Common Stock will continue to hold their Globus\nshares following completion of the Merger and therefore holders of Globus Common Stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the\nMerger.\nBecause NuVasive stockholders hold shares of stock that are listed on Nasdaq and are required under the Merger Agreement to accept only shares\nof another corporation listed on a national securities exchange and cash in lieu of fractional shares, they will not entitled to appraisal rights in connection\nwith the Merger. See the section titled \u201cNo Appraisal Rights.\u201d \nLawsuits may in the future be filed against Globus, NuVasive, and members of their respective boards of directors, challenging the Merger, and an\nadverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.\nTransactions such as the Merger are frequently subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that the Globus Board or\nNuVasive Board breached their respective fiduciary duties to their stockholders by entering into the Merger Agreement, by failing to obtain a greater\nvalue in the transaction for their stockholders or otherwise. See the section titled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Litigation Relating to the Merger.\u201d Neither Globus nor\nNuVasive can provide assurance that such litigation or other legal proceedings will not be brought. If litigation or other legal proceedings are in fact\nbrought against Globus or NuVasive, or against the Globus Board or NuVasive Board, they will defend against it, but might not be successful in doing so.\nAn adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the\nbusiness, results of operation or financial position of Globus, NuVasive or the Combined Company, including through the possible diversion of either\ncompany\u2019s resources or distraction of key personnel.\nFurthermore, one of the conditions to the completion of the Merger is the absence of an order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)\nenacted, promulgated, issued or entered after the date of the Merger Agreement by any governmental body enjoining, restraining, preventing or\nprohibiting the consummation of the Merger. As such, if any plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the consummation of the\nMerger, that injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.\nThe opinions of NuVasive\u2019s and Globus\u2019s financial advisors will not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the Merger Agreement\nand completion of the Merger. Because NuVasive\u2019s and Globus\u2019s financial advisors will not be updating their opinions, the opinions will not address\nthe fairness of the Exchange Ratio from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed.\nNuVasive and Globus have not obtained updated opinions from their respective financial advisors as of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and do not expect to receive updated opinions prior to completion of the Merger. Changes in the operations and prospects of\nNuVasive or Globus, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of NuVasive or Globus, and on which\nNuVasive\u2019s and Globus\u2019s financial advisors\u2019 opinions were based, may significantly alter the value of NuVasive or Globus or the prices of shares of\nNuVasive Common Stock or Globus Class A Common Stock by the time the Merger is completed. The opinions do not speak as of the time the Merger will\nbe completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. Because NuVasive\u2019s and Globus\u2019s financial advisors will not be updating their\nopinions, the opinions will not address the fairness of the Exchange Ratio from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed. For a\ndescription of the opinions that NuVasive and Globus received from their respective financial advisors, please refer to the section titled \u201cThe Merger\u2014\nOpinion of NuVasive\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinion of Globus\u2019s Financial Advisor.\u201d\nEnforceability of the Voting Agreement is limited by the terms thereof.\n20,867,524 shares of Globus Class B Common Stock (which represents approximately 70% of the total voting power of outstanding Globus Common\nStock as of the signing date of the Merger Agreement) are subject\n \n-30-\nTable of Contents\nto the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which the holders of such shares have agreed to vote all such shares with respect to the Globus Share Issuance\nProposal in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board as of the time of the Globus Special Meeting. NuVasive\u2019s legal remedies in case of\nbreach of the Voting Agreement are limited according to the terms of the Voting Agreement, and do not include the right to seek specific performance of\nobligations and covenants under the Voting Agreement.

        "Section Text": "Risks Relating to the Combined Company\nCombining the businesses of Globus and NuVasive may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the Combined Company may\nfail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which may adversely affect the Combined Company\u2019s business results and negatively affect the\nvalue of the Combined Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, Globus\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits, synergies and efficiencies from\ncombining the businesses of Globus and NuVasive. This success will depend on, among other factors, Globus\u2019s ability to successfully integrate its\nbusiness with the business of NuVasive. If Globus is not able to successfully integrate NuVasive\u2019s business into the Combined Company within the\nanticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated synergies, efficiencies and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take\nlonger to realize than expected.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could\nhave an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the Combined Company, which may adversely affect the value of\nthe common stock of the Combined Company.\nGlobus and NuVasive have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. There can be no assurances\nthat their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Globus or NuVasive\nemployees, the loss of surgeon customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards,\ncontrols, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration\nprocess that takes longer than originally anticipated. The challenges involved in this integration, which will be complex and time-consuming, include the\nfollowing:\n \n\u2022\ncombining the businesses of Globus and NuVasive, including respective operations and corporate functions, and meeting the capital\nrequirements of the Combined Company in a manner that permits the Combined Company to achieve any revenue synergies or efficiencies\nanticipated to result from the Merger, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized in the time\nframe currently anticipated or at all\u037e\n \n\u2022\nintegrating and retaining personnel from the two companies\u037e\n \n\u2022\nintegrating each company\u2019s technologies and technologies licensed by them from third parties\u037e\n \n\u2022\nidentifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets\u037e\n \n\u2022\nharmonizing each company\u2019s operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies,\nprocedures and processes\u037e\n \n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with each company\u2019s business partners, surgeons, suppliers and vendors, avoiding delays in entering into\nnew agreements with prospective business partners, surgeons, suppliers and vendors, and leveraging relationships with such third parties\nfor the benefit of the Combined Company\u037e\n \n\u2022\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies\u037e\n \n-31-Table of Contents\n\u2022\nconsolidating each company\u2019s administrative and information technology infrastructure\u037e coordinating sales activities and go-to-market\nefforts\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations\u037e and\n \n\u2022\neffecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory or other governmental approvals.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 management and resources may be focused on\ncompletion of the Merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other\nopportunities that may have been beneficial to such company, which may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing business and the business of the Combined\nCompany.\nThe Combined Company may be unable to realize the anticipated synergies and expects to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, which\ncould adversely affect the Combined Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Combined Company\u2019s ability to achieve estimated synergies in the timeframe anticipated, or at all, is subject to various assumptions, which\nmay or may not prove to be accurate. As a consequence, the Combined Company may not be able to realize all of these synergies within the timeframe\nexpected or at all. In addition, the Combined Company may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to realize these benefits. Failure to achieve the\nexpected synergies could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Merger.\nCertain contractual counterparties may seek to modify contractual relationships with the Combined Company, which could have an adverse effect\non the Combined Company\u2019s business and operations.\nAs a result of the Merger, the Combined Company may experience impacts on relationships with contractual counterparties (such as business\npartners, surgeons, vendors, sales representatives, contractors or other third party service providers) that may harm the Combined Company\u2019s business\nand results of operations. Certain counterparties may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the Merger whether or not contractual\nrights are triggered as a result of the Merger. There can be no guarantee that Globus\u2019s or NuVasive\u2019s contractual counterparties will remain with or\ncontinue to have a relationship with the Combined Company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the Merger. If any contractual\ncounterparties (such as business partners, surgeons, vendors, sales representatives, contractors or other third party service providers) seek to terminate\nor modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with the Combined Company, then the Combined Company\u2019s business and results of\noperations may be harmed.\nCompletion of the transaction may trigger change in control, assignment or other provisions in certain agreements to which NuVasive is a party,\nwhich may have an adverse impact on the Combined Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Merger may trigger change in control, assignment and other provisions in certain agreements to which NuVasive is a party. If\nNuVasive is unable to negotiate waivers of or consents under those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the\nagreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages or other remedies. Even if NuVasive is able to negotiate waivers, the\ncounterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to the Combined Company. Any of the\nforegoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Combined Company,\nor the ability of Globus to successfully integrate NuVasive\u2019s business.\nThe Combined Company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the Combined Company\u2019s business and\noperations.\nThe Combined Company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, partners, suppliers, contractors and other third\nparties due to the merger of Globus\u2019s and NuVasive\u2019s businesses following\n \n-32-\nTable of Contents\nthe Merger. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the Combined Company\u2019s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to the\nCombined Company\u2019s operations.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes\nonly and may not be reflective of the operating results and financial condition of the Combined Company following completion of the Merger.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative\npurposes only, contain a variety of adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and are not necessarily indicative of what the Combined\nCompany\u2019s actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated. The Combined\nCompany\u2019s actual results and financial position after the Merger may differ materially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects\nadjustments based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. The final acquisition accounting will\nbe based upon the actual consideration transferred and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of NuVasive as of the date of the completion of the\nMerger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\nreflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the section titled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial\nInformation.\u201d\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information provided in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus is based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and\ncompetition, general business, the medical device industry, and economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to Globus\u2019s or\nNuVasive\u2019s business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of the respective management teams of\nGlobus and NuVasive. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Important\nfactors that may affect actual results include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Globus\u2019s or NuVasive\u2019s business, as applicable\n(including each company\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and\neconomic conditions. See the section titled \u201cUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.\u201d\nGlobus\u2019s bylaws designate specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by Globus stockholders, which could\nlimit the ability of stockholders of the Combined Company to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Combined Company.\nGlobus\u2019s bylaws (which will govern the rights of NuVasive stockholders as stockholders of Globus following the Merger) provide that, unless\nGlobus consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on\nbehalf of Globus, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of Globus to Globus or\nGlobus stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against Globus or any director or officer or other employee of Globus arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the DGCL or the Globus charter or Globus bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), and (iv) any action asserting a claim against\nGlobus or any director or officer or other employee of Globus governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case, shall be the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). Globus\u2019s bylaws further\nprovide that unless Globus consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to\nthe fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act.\nThis Delaware forum provision and federal forum provision in the Globus bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in\npursuing any such claims. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may\n \n-33-\nTable of Contents\nlimit Globus stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with Globus or its directors, officers or\nemployees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against Globus and its directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful,\nmight benefit Globus stockholders. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates a concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits\nbrought concerning a duty or liability created by the securities laws, rules and regulations thereunder. While the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March\n2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under\nDelaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce its federal forum provision. If the federal forum provision is found to be\nunenforceable, Globus may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The federal forum provision may also impose additional\nlitigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the\nfederal district courts of the United States may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder\nconsidering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to Globus than\nits stockholders.\nThe financial forecasts are based on various assumptions that may not be realized.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d were based on assumptions of, and information\navailable to, NuVasive\u2019s and Globus\u2019s management when prepared and these estimates and assumptions are subject to uncertainties, many of which are\nbeyond NuVasive\u2019s and Globus\u2019s control and may not be realized. Many factors mentioned in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks\noutlined in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the events or circumstances described under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d\nwill be important in determining the Combined Company\u2019s future results. As a result of these contingencies, actual future results may vary materially from\nthe estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of financial estimates in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is not and should not be viewed\nas a representation that the forecasted results will necessarily reflect actual future results.\nThe financial estimates set forth in the forecasts included under the sections \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain NuVasive Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\u2014 Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d were not prepared with a view toward public\ndisclosure, and such financial estimates were not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of any regulatory or professional\nbody.

We\nrecommend you submit your vote by proxy prior to the date of the NuVasive Special Meeting even if you plan to attend the meeting\nvirtually via the internet.\nUnless revoked, all duly executed proxies representing shares of NuVasive Common Stock entitled to vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting will be\nvoted at the NuVasive Special Meeting and, where a choice has been specified on the proxy card, will be voted in accordance with such specification. If\nyou submit an executed proxy without providing instructions for any proposal, your shares will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Merger Proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d\nthe NuVasive Compensation Proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal. NuVasive does not expect that any matter other than the\nproposals listed above will be brought before the NuVasive Special Meeting.\nBeneficial (Street Name) Stockholders\nIf your shares of NuVasive Common Stock are held through a broker (typically referred to as being held in \u201cstreet name\u201d), you will receive separate\nvoting instructions from your broker. You must follow the voting instructions provided by your broker in order to instruct your broker on how to vote\nyour shares. Stockholders who hold shares in street name should generally be able to vote by returning the voting instruction form to their broker or by\ntelephone or via the internet. However, the availability of telephone or internet voting will depend on the voting process of your broker. If you hold\nshares in \u201cstreet name\u201d through a bank, broker or other nominee and intend to vote your shares online during the NuVasive Special Meeting, you must\nrequest and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and register to attend the NuVasive Special Meeting as a stockholder at\nwww.proxydocs.com/NUVA. See the section titled \u201cStockholders of Record.\u201d\nRevocability of Proxies\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the NuVasive Special Meeting by: (a) providing new\nvoting instructions by telephone or via the internet as described above\u037e (b) delivering a proxy revocation or another duly executed proxy bearing a later\ndate to the Secretary of NuVasive at NuVasive\u2019s principal executive offices located at 12101 Airport Way, Broomfield, CO 80021\u037e or\n \n-50-\nTable of Contents\n(c) voting during the NuVasive Special Meeting by following the instructions available on the NuVasive Special Meeting website. Attendance at the\nNuVasive Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy unless you actually vote at the NuVasive Special Meeting. If you beneficially hold shares in street\nname, you must contact the broker or other nominee holding your shares and follow their instructions to change your vote or revoke your proxy.\nProxy Solicitation Costs\nNuVasive is soliciting proxies on behalf of NuVasive and the NuVasive Board. NuVasive will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from NuVasive\nstockholders. Proxies may be solicited on behalf of NuVasive or the NuVasive Board by NuVasive directors, officers and other employees in person or by\nmail, telephone, facsimile, messenger, the internet or other means of communication, including electronic communication. NuVasive directors, officers and\nemployees will not be paid any additional amounts for their services or solicitation in this regard.\nNuVasive will request that banks, brokers and other nominee record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of NuVasive\nCommon Stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. NuVasive may be required to reimburse those banks, brokers and other nominees on\nrequest for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions.\nNuVasive has also retained Innisfree to assist in soliciting proxies and in communicating with NuVasive stockholders and estimates that it will pay\nInnisfree a fee of approximately $80,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. NuVasive also has agreed to indemnify Innisfree\nagainst various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions).\nHouseholding\nSEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to\ntwo or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This\nprocess, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d provides cost savings for companies. NuVasive has previously adopted householding for\nNuVasive stockholders of record. As a result, NuVasive stockholders with the same address and last name may receive only one copy of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Registered NuVasive stockholders (those who hold shares of NuVasive Common Stock directly in their name with NuVasive\u2019s\ntransfer agent) may opt out of householding and receive a separate joint proxy statement/prospectus or other proxy materials by sending a written\nrequest to NuVasive at the address below.\nSome brokers also household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple NuVasive stockholders sharing an address\nunless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be\nhouseholding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you\nno longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple\ncopies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker.\nIf you reside at the same address as another NuVasive stockholder and wish to receive a separate copy of the applicable materials, you may do so\nby contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record, or NuVasive by telephone at: (858) 210-2129 or by mail to: 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego,\nCalifornia 92121, Attn: Investor Relations Department. Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of the notice of the NuVasive\nSpecial Meeting and, if applicable, the proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these\ndocuments.\n \n-51-\nTable of Contents\nAdjournments\nIf a quorum is present at the NuVasive Special Meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the NuVasive Special Meeting to approve the\nNuVasive Merger Proposal, then NuVasive stockholders may be asked to vote on the NuVasive Adjournment Proposal. If a quorum is not present, the\nholders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, may adjourn the NuVasive Special Meeting, from time to time,\nwithout notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. The NuVasive Special Meeting may also be adjourned\nto another place, if any, date or time, even if a quorum is present.\nAt any subsequent reconvening of the NuVasive Special Meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have\nbeen transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the\nNuVasive Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened\nmeeting.\nAssistance\nIf you need assistance voting or completing your proxy card, or if you have questions regarding the NuVasive Special Meeting, please contact\nInnisfree, NuVasive\u2019s proxy solicitor for the NuVasive Special Meeting, at:\n \nInnisfree M&A Incorporated\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, New York 10022\nStockholders may call toll free: (877) 456-3524 \nBanks and Brokers may call collect: (212) 750-5833 \nNUVASIVE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR\nMORE DETAILED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER.

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nThe NuVasive Board regularly evaluates NuVasive\u2019s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view towards strengthening NuVasive\u2019s\nbusiness and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the NuVasive Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic\nalternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of, and potential improvements to, NuVasive\u2019s current business plan with NuVasive\nremaining an independent entity\u037e (2) capital allocation initiatives\u037e (3) potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions, partnerships or other\ncommercial relationships\u037e and (4) business combinations and other financial and strategic alternatives, including the sale of some or all of NuVasive.\nGlobus management and the Globus Board regularly evaluate the strategic opportunities available to Globus with a view towards strengthening\nGlobus\u2019s business, performance, industry positioning and prospects and enhancing stockholder value. As part of its ongoing evaluation, Globus has\nevaluated and considered from time to time various potential strategic transactions, including potential mergers with or acquisitions of other participants\nin the medical device industry. In January of 2021, the Globus Board contacted Goldman Sachs to evaluate potential acquisition targets in the medical\ndevice industry.\nAs active participants in the spine and orthopedics industry, NuVasive and Globus are well known to each other. From time to time, members of\nNuVasive management have met with members of Globus management to discuss their industry and their respective businesses. At various points in the\npast, NuVasive and Globus discussed consolidation in their industry and the potential for a business combination transaction between NuVasive and\nGlobus. These discussions were general in nature and did not advance beyond preliminary, exploratory conversations.\nOn September 24, 2021, at the request of Mr. David C. Paul, Executive Chairman of Globus, an in-person meeting was held to discuss the possibility\nof a business combination between NuVasive and Globus. Present at that meeting were Mr. Paul, Dave Demski, who was then the Chief Executive Officer\nof Globus, Daniel Wolterman, Chairman of the NuVasive Board, and Christopher Barry, the Chief Executive Officer of NuVasive.\n \n-57-Table of Contents\nOn October 1, 2021, the Globus Board held a meeting to discuss the opportunity with NuVasive, including the strategic rationale for the\ncombination, the relevant financial analysis, and the potential terms of a non-binding letter of intent.\nOn October 8, 2021, Globus sent a non-binding letter of intent (the \u201cOctober 2021 Letter\u201d), which proposed to combine NuVasive and Globus in an-\nall stock transaction. Among other terms, the October 2021 Letter offered consideration of 0.90 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of\nNuVasive Common Stock. On October 8, 2021, the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock was $58.03 and the closing price of Globus Class A Common\nStock was $76.07, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock of 18%.\nFollowing receipt of the October 2021 Letter, NuVasive contacted BofA Securities and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) to\ndiscuss and assess the risks and merits of the transaction proposed by the October 2021 Letter. BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton had previously\nprovided advisory services to NuVasive with respect to potential strategic transactions.\nShortly after NuVasive\u2019s receipt of the October 2021 Letter, Wachtell Lipton provided a draft mutual confidentiality agreement to facilitate\ndiscussions and the disclosure of information between NuVasive and Globus, and following negotiations and certain revisions thereof, NuVasive and\nGlobus entered into the mutual confidentiality agreement on October 22, 2021. The confidentiality agreement did not contain a standstill restriction on\nGlobus. At that time, and thereafter during the course of discussions between Globus and NuVasive until they entered into the Merger Agreement, no\nthird parties were subject to a standstill with NuVasive restricting them from making an acquisition proposal to NuVasive.\nOn November 1, 2021, the NuVasive Board held its regularly-scheduled quarterly meeting. The agenda for the November meeting included a session\nfocused on the industry and competitive landscape, a strategy review and a discussion of NuVasive\u2019s long-range business plan, and was updated to\ninclude consideration of the October 2021 Letter. At the meeting, representatives from BofA Securities presented an overview of various strategic\nalternatives and considerations for NuVasive, including with respect to the potential transaction with Globus contemplated by the October 2021 Letter. In\naddition, representatives from Wachtell Lipton discussed the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in the context of considering the potential transaction with\nGlobus and various considerations that should be included in the NuVasive Board\u2019s decision-making process. The NuVasive Board discussed NuVasive\u2019s\nstandalone strategy, as well as the potential risks and merits of a transaction with Globus and the potential value creation for NuVasive stockholders from\nsuch a transaction relative to NuVasive\u2019s long-range business plan. Following discussion, the NuVasive Board directed management to request a meeting\nbetween representatives of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Globus, and BofA Securities, financial advisor to NuVasive, to engage in discussions\nregarding potential risks and opportunities for a potential transaction.\nOn or about November 15, 2021, there were reports in the media that NuVasive and Globus were considering a potential transaction. These reports\nled to stock price volatility, as well as disruption impacting the companies\u2019 respective employees and other stakeholders. Given the very early stages of\ndiscussions between the parties, and the fact that no diligence information had yet been shared, Globus and NuVasive agreed on November 16, 2021 that\nengaging in more substantive interactions would lead to further unwanted disruption at that time. Therefore, the parties decided to cease further\ndiscussions with respect to a potential transaction and to pursue their standalone strategies instead.\nFrom the end of November 2021 through early October 2022, there were occasional communications between the parties, including communications\nabout industry trends and developments, as well as industry consolidation, but no substantive discussions regarding a possible strategic transaction.\nOn April 21, 2022, Mr. Demski resigned as Chief Executive Officer of Globus, and Mr. Daniel Scavilla was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of\nGlobus.\n \n-58-\nTable of Contents\nOn October 19, 2022, Mr. Paul called Mr. Wolterman to inquire if NuVasive would be open to receiving an indication of interest for a potential\ntransaction with Globus. Mr. Wolterman responded to Mr. Paul that NuVasive would give due consideration to an indication of interest.\nOn November 1, 2022, the Globus Board held a meeting with members of Globus management in attendance to discuss the opportunity with\nNuVasive including the strategic rationale, financial analysis, and terms of a non-binding letter of intent. The Globus Board recommended that Globus\nprovide NuVasive with a non-binding letter of intent reflecting the same terms as those in the October 2021 Letter, other than decreasing the exchange\nratio based on the current relative value of NuVasive Common Stock to Globus Class A Common stock.\nOn November 1, 2022, Mr. Paul sent Mr. Wolterman a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest (the \u201cNovember 1 Letter\u201d) setting forth certain\nterms under which Globus proposed to acquire NuVasive. The November 1 Letter offered consideration of 0.80 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock\nfor each share of NuVasive Common Stock. On November 1, 2022, the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock was $44.71 and the closing price of\nGlobus Class A Common Stock was $66.92, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock of 20%. The November 1 Letter also provided for\nthe expansion of the Globus Board to include up to 4 members of the NuVasive Board, a 60-day exclusivity period for negotiations between NuVasive and\nGlobus and a $120 million termination fee that would be payable by NuVasive in the event the parties entered into a definitive agreement and NuVasive\nsubsequently decided not to consummate the transaction.\nOn November 2, 2022, the NuVasive Board held its regularly-scheduled quarterly meeting. The agenda for the meeting included a session focused\non the industry and competitive landscape, a strategy review and a discussion of NuVasive\u2019s long-range business plan, and was updated to include\nconsideration of the November 1 Letter. Mr. Wolterman provided an overview of his communications with Mr. Paul, and members of management\nprovided their perspective on the merits and risks of engaging in further discussions with Globus. Following discussion, the NuVasive Board directed\nmanagement to engage with Globus to assess the potential opportunity afforded by a transaction, but to reject Globus\u2019s request for exclusivity (and, at\nno point prior to the signing of the merger agreement did NuVasive agree to such exclusivity). Thereafter, on November 3, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman, Paul,\nBarry and Scavilla engaged in communications about a potential transaction, and Messrs. Wolterman and Barry provided feedback from the NuVasive\nBoard on the November 1 Letter to Messrs. Paul and Scavilla.\nDuring the course of the negotiations with Globus following NuVasive\u2019s receipt of the November 1 Letter, members of NuVasive management\nprovided updates via email to the NuVasive Board regarding the terms proposed by Globus as well as ongoing communications between the parties.\nDuring the period between November 1, 2022 and November 15, 2022, the gap between the stock price of Globus Class A Common Stock and the\nstock price of NuVasive Common Stock generally continued to increase. The closing price of Globus Class A Common Stock increased approximately\n7.3% during such period, whereas the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock decreased by approximately 16.6% in the same period.\nOn November 14, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman and Paul discussed various matters pertaining to Globus\u2019s intent to submit a revised indication of\ninterest.\nOn the morning of November 16, 2022, Mr. Paul sent a revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest dated November 15, 2022 (the\n\u201cNovember 15 Letter\u201d) to Mr. Wolterman, which proposed an exchange ratio of 0.72 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of NuVasive\nCommon Stock. On November 16, 2022, the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock was $36.42 and the closing price of Globus Class A Common Stock\nwas $70.40, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock of 39%. The November 15 Letter also provided for the expansion of the Globus\nBoard to include up to 2 members of the NuVasive Board, and a 60-day exclusivity period for negotiations between NuVasive and Globus. The\n \n-59-\nTable of Contents\nNovember 15 Letter also proposed that if the parties executed a definitive agreement and a party subsequently decided not to consummate the\ntransaction, the terminating party would pay the other party a termination fee of $120 million. Thereafter, on November 16, 2022, Mr. Paul called Mr.\nWolterman to discuss the terms of this revised proposal. Among other things, Mr. Paul indicated that the recent stock price decline of NuVasive Common\nStock and the stock price increase of Globus Class A Common Stock had impacted Globus\u2019s perspective on the exchange ratio.\nOn November 18, 2022, Mr. Wolterman indicated to Mr. Paul that, in light of the macro-economic environment and continued stock price volatility,\nNuVasive would be pausing discussions to focus on other initiatives that were underway but that he was open to reconnecting later with Mr. Paul.\nOn November 28, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman and Barry met in person with Messrs. Paul and Scavilla. At that meeting, the parties discussed the\nmerits of a merger between NuVasive and Globus, including potential synergies that could be achieved from the merger. Messrs. Wolterman and Barry\nalso indicated to Messrs. Paul and Scavilla that the exchange ratio proposed in the November 15 Letter undervalued NuVasive and was thus not\nacceptable to NuVasive.\nThereafter, on December 2, 2022, Messrs. Wolterman and Paul engaged in further discussions regarding the relative stock prices of NuVasive and\nGlobus and the exchange ratio for the potential merger, as well as the possibility that Globus would submit a revised indication of interest.\nOn December 5, 2022, the NuVasive Board met with members of NuVasive management regarding various strategic initiatives underway, and Mr.\nWolterman noted that Globus and NuVasive were continuing to discuss the possibility of a merger. At the meeting, the NuVasive Board authorized\nmanagement to direct BofA Securities to engage in valuation discussions with Globus\u2019s financial advisor.\nThereafter, representatives of BofA Securities had calls with representatives of Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Globus, in which they\ndiscussed, among other things, the exchange ratio for the potential merger.\nOn December 8, 2022, the Globus Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, with members of Globus management in attendance, at which it\ndiscussed the status of the negotiations for the potential merger with NuVasive and the terms of the November 15 Letter. Following such discussion, the\nGlobus Board recommended to increase the proposed exchange ratio to 0.75 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of NuVasive\nCommon Stock.\nOn December 16, 2022, Mr. Paul sent a further revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest (the \u201cDecember 16 Letter\u201d) to Mr. Wolterman.\nThe December 16 Letter offered a revised exchange ratio of 0.75 shares of Globus Class A Common Stock for each share of NuVasive Common Stock, but\notherwise proposed substantially the same terms for a transaction as the November 15 Letter. On December 16, 2022, the closing price of NuVasive\nCommon Stock was $40.38 and the closing price of Globus Class A Common Stock was $71.63, reflecting an implied premium for NuVasive Common Stock\nof 33%.\nOn December 17, 2022, the NuVasive Board met with members of NuVasive management and representatives of BofA Securities. Representatives of\nBofA Securities reviewed with the NuVasive Board BofA Securities\u2019s preliminary financial analysis of the exchange ratio proposed to be received by\nNuVasive stockholders in the merger, and members of NuVasive management provided the NuVasive Board with their initial views of possible synergies\nfrom a combination of NuVasive and Globus. In addition, the NuVasive Board considered risks and opportunities relating to NuVasive\u2019s strategic plan,\nincluding the expected value creation opportunity from continued execution of NuVasive\u2019s standalone strategy. The NuVasive Board also discussed\nvarious considerations involved in soliciting indications of interest from other third parties for a potential transaction with NuVasive, including whether a\nhigher value could be obtained for NuVasive stockholders from a third party and whether increased competition could result in more attractive pricing or\nother terms for\n \n-60-\nTable of Contents\nNuVasive from Globus, as well as potential risks and disruption that could occur from exploratory outreaches and potential market rumors that may result,\nand a potential adverse reaction from Globus that could negatively impact its willingness to continue pursuing a transaction with NuVasive. Following\ndiscussions with NuVasive management and representatives of BofA Securities, the NuVasive Board was of the view that there was unlikely to be a third\nparty who would be able or willing to provide greater value for NuVasive stockholders as compared to the exchange ratio proposed by Globus in the\nDecember 16 Letter, and accordingly authorized NuVasive management to continue exploratory discussions with Globus, to work with BofA Securities\nand Wachtell Lipton and to concurrently commence a mutual diligence process.\nAlso in conjunction with the December 17, 2022 meeting of the NuVasive Board, the NuVasive Board was provided with certain information from\nBofA Securities regarding any material relationships between BofA Securities and Globus during the preceding two-year period as well as information\nregarding certain bond hedge and warrant arrangements that certain BofA Securities affiliates, acting as principals for their own accounts, had entered\ninto with NuVasive in connection with NuVasive\u2019s 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 (collectively, the Call Spread Transactions, as defined and\ndescribed further in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cThe Merger \u2014 Opinion of NuVasive\u2019s Financial Advisor \u2014 Call Spread\nTransactions\u201d). Given that the conversion price for the convertible notes was well in excess of the closing price of NuVasive Common Stock on December\n16, 2022, NuVasive management was of the view that the conversion right was unlikely to be exercised by noteholders and, accordingly, BofA Securities\u2019\npotential obligations pursuant to the hedging arrangements were immaterial.\nOn December 19, 2022, Mr. Wolterman called Mr. Paul to indicate NuVasive\u2019s desire to move forward with mutual diligence and that NuVasive was\nprepared to accept the exchange ratio proposed in the December 16 Letter but that the proposed termination fees and request for exclusivity were not\nacceptable to NuVasive and that NuVasive desired a number of directors on the board of the combined company that would be proportionate to the\nownership percentage of NuVasive stockholders in the combined company.\nOn December 21, 2022, the Globus Board held a meeting to discuss Mr. Paul\u2019s December 19th call with Mr. Wolterman, the terms of the December 16\nLetter, including the amount of the termination fee and the number of NuVasive Board members that could be appointed to serve on the Globus Board\npost-merger. Following such discussion, the Globus Board authorized Globus management to propose to NuVasive that Globus was willing to add an\nadditional NuVasive director to the Globus Board following the merger (for a total of up to three NuVasive directors) and recommended that Mr. Paul\nreiterate Globus\u2019s desire for a $120 million mutual termination fee if the merger agreement between the parties was terminated under certain circumstances.\nOn December 21, 2022, Mr. Paul stated in a call with Mr. Wolterman that Globus was willing to expand the Globus Board to eleven directors in order\nto allow three NuVasive directors to join the Globus Board at the closing of the proposed transaction, but reiterated Globus\u2019s view that the proposed\ntransaction should have a mutual termination fee of $120 million.\nOn December 22 and December 23, 2022, Messrs.

opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs, subsequently confirmed in writing dated as of February 8, 2023, to the Globus Board\nthat, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to Globus, as more fully described in the section titled \u201c\u2014Opinion

outside legal and financial advisors. Based on this review and consideration, the NuVasive Board unanimously concluded\nthat these factors, on balance, supported a determination that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of NuVasive stockholders, and to make its recommendation to NuVasive\nstockholders that they vote to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIn addition, the NuVasive Board was aware of and considered the fact that NuVasive\u2019s directors and executive officers may have certain interests in\nthe transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of NuVasive stockholders generally, as described in the section of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus titled \u201cInterests of NuVasive Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.\u201d\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the NuVasive Board considered is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive.

In view of the complexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the NuVasive Board considered in connection\nwith its evaluation of the transaction, the NuVasive Board did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or\nspecific weights or values to any\n \n-77-\nTable of Contents\nof the factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any\naspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the NuVasive Board.

        "Section Text": "Opinion of Globus\u2019s Financial Advisor\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nGoldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Globus Board that, as of February 8, 2023 and based upon and\nsubject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to\nGlobus.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 8, 2023, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services\nand its opinion for the information and assistance of the Globus Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is\nnot a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Globus Common Stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other\nthings:\n \n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n \n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Globus and NuVasive for the five years ended December 31,\n2021\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Globus and NuVasive\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Globus and NuVasive to their respective stockholders\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Globus and NuVasive\u037e\n \n\u2022\ncertain internal financial analyses and forecasts for NuVasive prepared by its management, which were referred to earlier as the\n\u201cNuVasive Standalone Projections\u201d\u037e and\n \n\u2022\ncertain financial analyses and forecasts for NuVasive (the \u201cGlobus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections\u201d) based on the\nNuVasive Standalone Projections, certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Globus standalone (which were referred to\nearlier as the \u201cGlobus Standalone Projections\u201d) and pro forma for the Merger based on the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone\nProjections and the Globus Standalone Projections (the \u201cGlobus Pro Forma Projections\u201d), in each case, as prepared by the\nmanagement of Globus and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Globus, including in the case of the Globus Pro Forma Projections\ncertain operating synergies and dis-synergies projected by the management of Globus to result from the Merger, as approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by Globus (which were referred to earlier as the \u201cGlobus Synergy Projections\u201d). See the section entitled\n\u201c\u2014Certain Globus Unaudited Prospective Financial Information\u201d.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Globus and NuVasive regarding their assessment of the past and\ncurrent business operations, financial condition and future prospects of\n \n-78-Table of Contents\nNuVasive and with the members of senior management of Globus regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial\ncondition and future prospects of Globus and the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits of, the Merger\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading\nactivity for the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock and the shares of NuVasive Common Stock\u037e compared certain financial and stock market\ninformation for Globus and NuVasive with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the\nfinancial terms of certain recent business combinations in the healthcare industry and in other industries\u037e and performed such other studies and analyses,\nand considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Globus\u2019s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of\nthe financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility\nfor independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Globus\u2019s consent that the Globus Standalone Projections, the Globus\nAdjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections and the Globus Pro Forma Projections, including the Globus Synergy Projections were reasonably prepared\non a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Globus. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent\nevaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Globus or\nNuVasive or any of their respective subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all\ngovernmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on\nGlobus or NuVasive or on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger will be\nconsummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in\nany way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Globus to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger\nas compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Globus\u037e nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to Globus, as of the date of the opinion, of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or\nthe Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection\nwith the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities,\ncreditors or other constituencies of Globus\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the\nofficers, directors or employees of Globus or NuVasive, or any class of such persons in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the Exchange\nRatio pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions\nas in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes no responsibility for\nupdating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In addition, Goldman\nSachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Globus Class A Common Stock or NuVasive Common Stock will trade at any time,\nas to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Globus or NuVasive or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on\nthe solvency or viability of Globus or NuVasive or the ability of Globus or NuVasive to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.\nSummary of Material Financial Analysis\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Globus Board in connection with rendering the\nopinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by\nGoldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the\nsummaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read\n \n-79-\nTable of Contents\ntogether with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the\nfollowing quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 7, 2023 and is\nnot necessarily indicative of current market conditions. For purposes of its analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated $58.41 as the implied consideration per\nshare of NuVasive Common Stock to be paid to holders of shares of NuVasive Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, by multiplying the\nExchange Ratio by $77.88, the closing price of shares of Globus Class A Common Stock on February 7, 2023.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\u2014NuVasive Standalone\nUsing the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on NuVasive\non a standalone basis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of NuVasive Common Stock. Using the mid-year convention for\ndiscounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 9.5%, reflecting estimates of NuVasive\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman\nSachs discounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for NuVasive for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 as\nreflected in the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for NuVasive, as of December 31, 2027,\nwhich were calculated by applying terminal year next twelve months\u2019 (\u201cNTM\u201d) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d)\nadjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses and settlements, costs related to licensing and acquisition of in-process research and\ndevelopment and non-recurring and other significant one-time items (the \u201cNuVasive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) exit multiples ranging from 10.0x to 11.0x, to a\nterminal year estimate of the NTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by NuVasive, as reflected in the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone\nProjections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 3.4% to 5.8%). The range of terminal year NTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA exit\nmultiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of NuVasive\nfor February 2020 through February 2023. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\u201cCAPM\u201d),\nwhich requires certain company-specific inputs, including NuVasive\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on\npermanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for NuVasive, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States\nfinancial markets generally.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for NuVasive by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman\nSachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for NuVasive the amount of NuVasive\u2019s net debt (including the net present\nvalue (\u201cNPV\u201d) of certain contingent liabilities relating to certain historical acquisitions, including the acquisition of Simplify Medical Pty Limited by\nNuVasive (collectively, the \u201cNuVasive Contingent Liabilities\u201d)) as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for NuVasive. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of\nillustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of NuVasive Common Stock, as provided by the management of\nNuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present\nvalues per share of NuVasive Common Stock ranging from $39.61 to $48.76.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\u2014NuVasive Standalone\nUsing the Globus Adjusted NuVasive Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an\nillustrative future value per share of NuVasive Common Stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value (\u201cEV\u201d) for\nNuVasive as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative EV to NTM NuVasive Adjusted\nEBITDA (\u201cNTM EV / NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) of 10.0x to 11.0x to estimates of NuVasive\u2019s NTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA for each of the fiscal\nyears 2023 through 2025. This illustrative range of NTM EV / NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical NTM EV / NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA multiples for NuVasive for\nFebruary 2020 through February 2023.\n \n-80-\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of NuVasive\u2019s net debt (including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities), for each of the fiscal\nyears 2023 through 2025, each as provided by the management of Globus and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, from the\nrespective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for NuVasive for each of the fiscal years 2023\nthrough 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of NuVasive\nCommon Stock for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, calculated using information provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of implied future values per share of NuVasive Common Stock. Goldman Sachs then\ndiscounted these implied future equity values per share of NuVasive Common Stock to December 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.2%,\nreflecting an estimate of NuVasive\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including a beta for NuVasive, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis\nresulted in a range of implied present values of $42.32 to $49.49 per share of NuVasive Common Stock.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the healthcare industry. For each of the selected\ntransactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration paid in\nthe transaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s last twelve months\u2019 (\u201cLTM\u201d) adjusted EBITDA based on information in public filings and press\nreleases. While none of the companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to NuVasive, the companies that participated\nin the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of NuVasive\u2019s results,\nmarket sizes and product profile.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\n \nSelected Transactions\nEV / LTM\nAnnouncement Date\nAcquiror\nTarget\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOctober 2022\nOrthofix Medical Inc.\nSeaSpine Holdings Corporation\nNA\nMay 2019\n3M Company\nAcelity, Inc.\n15.0x\nNovember 2018\nBoston Scientific Corporation\nBTG plc\n15.5x\nNovember 2018\nColfax Corporation\nDJO Global, Inc.\n11.7x\nSeptember 2018\nMedtronic plc\nMazor Robotics Ltd.\nNA\nAugust 2018\nStryker Corporation\nK2M Group Holdings, Inc.\nNA\nOctober 2017\nTPG Capital, L.P.\nExactech, Inc.\n16.9x\nJune 2016\nZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\nLDR Holding Corporation\nNA\nSeptember 2015\nDentsply International Inc.\nSirona Dental Systems, Inc.\n16.1x\nFebruary 2015\nCyberonics, Inc.\nSorin S.p.A.\n11.7x\nOctober 2014\nSteris Corporation\nSynergy Health plc\n13.0x\nOctober 2014\nWright Medical Group, Inc.\nTornier N.V.\nNA\nApril 2014\nZimmer Holdings, Inc.\nBiomet, Inc.\n12.1x\nFebruary 2014\nSmith & Nephew plc\nArthroCare Corporation\n16.9x\n \n-81-\nTable of Contents\nBased on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs\u2019 professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference\nrange of EV / LTM adjusted EBITDA multiples based on information in public filings of 11.7x to 16.9x to NuVasive\u2019s LTM NuVasive Adjusted EBITDA as\nof December 31, 2022, as provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, to derive a\nrange of implied enterprise values for NuVasive. Goldman Sachs then subtracted the net debt (including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities)\nof NuVasive as of December 31, 2022, as provided by the management of NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus,\nand divided the result by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of NuVasive Common Stock as of February 6, 2023, as provided by the\nmanagement of NuVasive and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a reference\nrange of implied values per share of NuVasive Common Stock of $45.56 to $72.21.\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-stock mergers announced from January 1,\n2013 through February 7, 2023 involving a public company based in the United States as the target where the disclosed equity values for the transaction\nwere between $0.5 billion and $5.0 billion and the acquiror had a pro forma ownership of the combined company between 60% and 75%. This analysis\nexcluded transactions in the banking, financial services, insurance, oil and gas, real estate and utilities industries. For the entire period, using publicly\navailable information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the eight transactions relative\nto the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 19.5% across\nthe period. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 14.9% and 75th percentile premium of 30.1% across the period, respectively. Using\nthis analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 14.9% to 30.1% to the undisturbed closing price per share of NuVasive\nCommon Stock of $46.91 as of February 7, 2023 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of NuVasive Common Stock of $53.89 to $61.03.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis \u2013 Globus Standalone\nUsing the Globus Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Globus on a standalone basis\nto derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and\ndiscount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, reflecting estimates of Globus\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value\nas of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Globus for the fiscal years 2023 through 2027 as reflected in the Globus Standalone\nProjections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Globus, as of December 31, 2027, which were calculated by applying terminal year NTM\nEBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses and settlements, costs related to acquisitions and costs related to licensing\nand acquisition of in-process research and development (the \u201cGlobus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) exit multiples ranging from 16.5x to 18.5x, to a\nterminal year estimate of the NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA to be generated by Globus, as reflected in the Globus Standalone Projections\n(which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from 4.6% to 6.9%). The range of terminal year NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA exit\nmultiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of Globus\nfor February 2020 through February 2023. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the CAPM which requires certain company-\nspecific inputs, including Globus\u2019s standalone target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if\nany, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Globus on a standalone basis, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial\nmarkets generally.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Globus on a standalone basis by adding the ranges of present values it derived\nabove. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative\n \n-82-\nTable of Contents\nenterprise values it derived for Globus on a standalone basis the amount of Globus\u2019s net debt (including the NPV of certain contingent liabilities relating\nto the acquisition of Excelsius Surgical and other transactions by Globus (collectively, the \u201cGlobus Contingent Liabilities\u201d)) on a standalone basis, as of\nDecember 31, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for\nGlobus. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus\nCommon Stock, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range\nof illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock ranging from $73.27 to $84.74.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis \u2013 Globus Standalone\nUsing the Globus Standalone Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future\nvalue per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value for Globus as of\nDecember 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative EV to NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted\nEBITDA (\u201cNTM EV / Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) of 16.5x to 18.5x to estimates of Globus\u2019s NTM Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA for\neach of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This illustrative range of NTM EV / Globus Standalone Adjusted EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by\nGoldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical NTM EV / Globus Standalone Adjusted\nEBITDA multiples for Globus for February 2020 through February 2023.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Globus\u2019s net debt (including the NPV of the Globus Contingent Liabilities) on a standalone basis, for\neach of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, each as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, from the respective\nimplied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values as of December 31 for Globus for each of the fiscal years 2023 through\n2025. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus Common\nStock for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, calculated using information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management\nof Globus, to derive a range of implied future values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied future\nequity values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock to December 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.8%, reflecting an estimate of\nGlobus\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs,\nincluding a beta for Globus, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of\nimplied present values of $67.60 to $76.35 per share of Globus Class A Common Stock.\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis \u2013 Globus Pro Forma\nUsing the Globus Pro Forma Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Globus pro forma for the\nMerger to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash\nflows and discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0%, reflecting estimates of Globus\u2019s pro forma weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs\ndiscounted to present value as of December 31, 2022 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Globus pro forma for the Merger for the fiscal years 2023\nthrough 2027, as reflected in the Globus Pro Forma Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Globus, as of December 31, 2027, which\nwere calculated by applying terminal year NTM EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses and settlements, costs\nrelated to acquisitions, costs related to licensing and acquisition of in-process research and development and non-recurring and other significant one-\ntime items (the \u201cGlobus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) exit multiples ranging from 13.5x to 15.5x, to a terminal year estimate of the NTM Globus Pro Forma\nAdjusted EBITDA to be generated by Globus on a pro forma basis, as reflected in the Globus Pro Forma Projections (which analysis implied perpetuity\ngrowth rates ranging from 3.9% to 6.4%). The\n \n-83-\nTable of Contents\nrange of terminal year NTM Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA exit multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and\nexperience, taking into account historical trading multiples of Globus and NuVasive for February 2020 through February 2023. Goldman Sachs derived\nsuch discount rates by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including Globus\u2019s pro forma target capital structure\nweightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for Globus pro\nforma for the Merger, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Globus pro forma for the Merger by adding the ranges of present values it\nderived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative pro forma enterprise values it derived for Globus, the pro forma net debt\n(including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities, the NPV of the Globus Contingent Liabilities and estimate transaction fees with respect to the\nMerger) of Globus as of December 31, 2022, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, to derive a range of\nillustrative equity values for Globus on a pro forma basis. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the pro forma\nnumber of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock, as provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of\nGlobus, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock ranging from $77.66\nto $93.53.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis \u2013 Globus Pro Forma\nUsing the Globus Pro Forma Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future\nvalue per share of Globus Class A Common Stock pro forma for the Merger. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value\nfor Globus pro forma for the Merger as of December 31 for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, by applying a range of multiples of illustrative EV to\nNTM Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (\u201cNTM EV / Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) of 13.5x to 15.5x to estimates of Globus\u2019s NTM Globus Pro\nForma Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. This illustrative range of NTM EV / Globus Pro Forma\nAdjusted EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and\nhistorical NTM EV / Globus Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA multiples for Globus and NuVasive for February 2020 through February 2023.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of Globus\u2019s pro forma net debt (including the NPV of the NuVasive Contingent Liabilities, the NPV of\nthe Globus Contingent Liabilities and estimate transaction fees with respect to the Merger), for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025, each as\nprovided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, from the respective implied enterprise values in order to derive a range\nof illustrative equity values as of December 31 for Globus on a pro forma basis for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided\nthese implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock on a pro forma basis for each\nof fiscal years 2023 through 2025, calculated using information provided by and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Globus, to\nderive a range of implied future values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock on a pro forma basis. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied\nfuture equity values per share of Globus Class A Common Stock to December 31, 2022, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.7%, reflecting an estimate of\nGlobus\u2019s pro forma cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific\ninputs, including a beta for Globus and NuVasive, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis\nresulted in a range of implied present values of $69.62 to $85.58 per share of Globus Class A Common Stock pro forma for the Merger.\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without\n \n-84-\nTable of Contents\nconsidering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness\ndetermination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered\nby it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results\nof all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Globus or NuVasive or the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs providing its opinion to the Globus Board as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view to Globus, as of February 8, 2023, of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Globus\nor the Globus Board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the Merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Globus Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Globus Board in\nmaking its determination to approve the Merger Agreement.

Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not\nentirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating\ncharacteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which NuVasive was compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of NuVasive to calculate the estimated present value\nof the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that NuVasive was\n \n-89-\nTable of Contents\nforecasted to generate during NuVasive\u2019s fiscal years 2023 through 2027 based on the Revised NuVasive Standalone Projections. BofA Securities\ncalculated terminal values for NuVasive by applying last-twelve-month EBITDA terminal multiples of 9.5x to 11.5x to NuVasive\u2019s fiscal year 2027 estimated\nadjusted EBITDA, which implied a perpetuity growth rate ranging between 5.2% and 6.4%. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to\npresent value as of December 31, 2022, assuming a mid-period convention for cash flows, using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.0%. From the\nresulting enterprise values, BofA Securities deducted net debt as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 (treating the amount of the 2023\nConvertible Notes, defined below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014Call Spread Transactions,\u201d and the amount of NuVasive\u2019s convertible senior notes due 2025,\nas debt) to derive equity values.

As noted above, the discussion set forth above under \u201c\u2014Summary of Material NuVasive Financial Analyses,\u201d \u201c\u2014Summary of\nMaterial Globus Financial Analyses\u201d and \u201c\u2014Summary of Material Relative Financial Analyses\u201d is a summary of the material financial analyses presented\nby BofA Securities to the NuVasive Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by BofA\nSecurities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the\nmost appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a\nfinancial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses summarized above must\nbe considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information\npresented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view\n \n-93-\nTable of Contents\nof the processes underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not\nmeant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many\nof which are beyond the control of NuVasive and Globus. The estimates of the future performance of NuVasive in or underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses\nare not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those\nsuggested by BofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, of the Exchange Ratio and were provided to the NuVasive Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not\npurport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade\nat any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are\ninherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual values of NuVasive or Globus.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between NuVasive and Globus, rather than by\nany financial advisor, and was approved by the NuVasive Board. The decision to enter into the Merger agreement was solely that of the NuVasive Board.\nAs described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the NuVasive Board in its evaluation of the\nproposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the NuVasive Board or management with respect to the Merger or the\nExchange Ratio.\nNuVasive has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee, which is estimated, based on the\ninformation available as of the date of announcement, to be approximately $27 million, $3 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and\nthe remainder of which is contingent upon the completion of the Merger. NuVasive also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its expenses incurred\nin connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any controlling person of BofA Securities and each of their respective\ndirectors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives\ntrading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset\nand investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,\ngovernments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Securities and its affiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of\ncustomers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity,\ndebt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of NuVasive, Globus and certain of their\nrespective affiliates.  \nBofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial\nbanking and other financial services to NuVasive and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services,\nincluding (i) having acted or acting as financial advisor to NuVasive in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions, (ii) having acted or\nacting as an administrative agent, bookrunner and/or arranger for, and/or as a lender under, certain letters of credit, credit facilities and other credit\narrangements of NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates, (iii) having provided or providing certain derivatives, foreign exchange and other trading\nservices to NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates, and (iv) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to\nNuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates. In addition, BofA Securities have maintained, currently are maintaining, and in the future may maintain,\ncommercial (including vendor and/or customer) relationships with NuVasive and/or certain of its affiliates. From February 1, 2021 through January 31,\n2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates\n \n-94-\nTable of Contents\nderived aggregate revenues from NuVasive and certain of its affiliates of approximately $6 million for investment and corporate banking services.\nIn addition, BofA Securities and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment banking,\ncommercial banking and other financial services to Globus and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these\nservices, including (i) having acted or acting as a lender under certain letters of credit, credit and leasing facilities and other credit arrangements of Globus\nand/or certain of its affiliates, (ii) provided or providing certain foreign exchange and other trading services to Globus and/or certain of its affiliates, and\n(iii) having provided or providing certain treasury management products and services to Globus and/or certain of its affiliates. From February 1, 2021\nthrough January 31, 2023, BofA Securities and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Globus and certain of its affiliates of approximately $3 million\nfor investment and corporate banking services.\nCall Spread Transactions\nConcurrent with NuVasive\u2019s issuance in June 2020 of $450 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023\nConvertible Notes\u201d), NuVasive entered into separate convertible bond hedge transactions (the \u201cConvertible Bond Hedge Transactions\u201d) and issuer\nwarrant transactions (the \u201cIssuer Warrant Transactions\u201d and, collectively with the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions, the \u201cCall Spread Transactions\u201d)\nwith four banks (each a \u201cCall Spread Counterparty\u201d and collectively, the \u201cCall Spread Counterparties\u201d), including Bank of America, N.A. (\u201cBANA\u201d), an\naffiliate of BofA Securities, acting as principal for its own account in respect of 20% of the Call Spread Transactions.\nThe Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions consisted of the purchase by NuVasive from the Call Spread Counterparties of call options in respect of\nthe number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock initially underlying the 2023 Convertible Notes, expiring when the Notes mature (i.e., June 1, 2023), and\nwith an initial strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the 2023 Convertible Notes of approximately $84.1907. The Issuer Warrant Transactions\nconsist of the sale by NuVasive to such Call Spread Counterparties of warrants in respect of the same number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock and\nwith an initial strike price of $104.8410. The strike prices of the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions and Issuer Warrant Transactions are subject to\ncertain adjustments. Because the Convertible Bond Hedges expire and the 2023 Convertible Notes mature on June 1, 2023, it is possible that neither the\nConvertible Bond Hedges nor the 2023 Convertible Notes will remain outstanding by the time the Merger is consummated. The Issuer Warrant\nTransactions expire over a series of expiration dates commencing September 1, 2023 and ending November 27, 2023.\nIf the Merger is consummated prior to maturity of the 2023 Convertible Notes, the 2023 Convertible Notes would become convertible into the\nacquirer\u2019s shares and the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions would similarly become exercisable for the acquirer\u2019s shares. To the extent that the post-\nmerger volatility of the acquirer\u2019s shares were to exceed the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock before the announcement of the merger, the fair value of\nthe Call Spread Counterparties\u2019 liabilities under the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions would increase, and to the extent the post-merger volatility of\nthe acquirer\u2019s shares were less than the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock before the announcement of the merger, the fair value of the Call Spread\nCounterparties\u2019 liabilities under the Convertible Bond Hedge Transaction would decrease.\nFollowing the announcement or consummation of the Merger, the Call Spread Counterparties may adjust the terms of the Issuer Warrant\nTransactions to preserve the fair value of the Transactions after taking into account the announcement or consummation. Each Call Spread Counterparty\nwill determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner as calculation agent with respect to its Issuer Warrant Transaction, the economic\neffect of such an announcement or consummation on the value of its Issuer Warrant Transaction and may take into account a number of factors,\nincluding, for example, the date of the announcement (and the remaining term of the Issuer Warrant Transactions at that time), the stock price and\nchanges in volatility, stock loan rate, liquidity and expected dividends of NuVasive Common Stock. Upon consummation of the Merger, the\n \n-95-\nTable of Contents\nIssuer Warrant Transactions will become convertible into the acquirer\u2019s shares. Each Call Spread Counterparty must also make additional adjustments to\nits Issuer Warrant Transaction following the announcement of a change to the Merger (including the withdrawal, abandonment or discontinuation of the\nMerger).\nUnder the Call Spread Transactions to which it is a counterparty, BANA has market exposure to the price of shares of NuVasive Common Stock. It is\nstandard industry practice, and BANA\u2019s ordinary practice, to engage in hedging activities to reduce market exposure to the price of the common stock\nunderlying derivative transactions such as the Call Spread Transactions. Such hedging includes BANA or its affiliates either purchasing or selling shares\nof the NuVasive Common Stock or related instruments to offset the exposure to the NuVasive Common Stock that BANA has under the Call Spread\nTransactions. BANA\u2019s hedging is intended to substantially reduce BANA\u2019s exposure under the Call Spread Transactions to changes in the price of shares\nof the NuVasive Common Stock.\nHedging does not fully offset every risk or change in market conditions. Hedging is designed to offset a range of normal price movements under a\nrange of typical market conditions, based on publicly available information, and thus might not fully offset extraordinary market events or conditions\n(such as the announcement or consummation of a merger transaction) that might have a material effect on the price, volatility or other characteristics of\nNuVasive Common Stock. BANA\u2019s hedging activity is at its own risk and might result in a loss or profit to BANA in an amount that might be less than or\ngreater than the expected contractual benefit or loss to BANA under the Call Spread Transactions it entered into. BANA\u2019s ultimate loss or profit with\nrespect to the Call Spread Transactions after taking into account its hedging activity would depend on many factors, including the original net premium\nreceived by BANA for the Call Spread Transactions, the price at which BANA established its initial hedge position in respect of the Call Spread\nTransactions, the deliveries or payments made or received pursuant to the Call Spread Transactions, the profit and loss realized by BANA in connection\nwith rebalancing its stock hedge positions during the term of the Call Spread Transactions (such rebalancing occurring as frequently as intra-day), and\nthe premium or other amounts paid, and payments received, in connection with entering into or maintaining any option position or other derivative\ntransaction used to hedge the Call Spread Transactions, the volatility of shares of the NuVasive Common Stock and the prices at which BANA would\nclose out these hedge positions. The amount of any loss or profit would not be known until all of the Call Spread Transactions to which BANA is a party\nhave been exercised, expired or terminated and BANA has completed all of its related hedge unwind activities. In accordance with industry practices,\nBofA Securities maintains an enterprise information wall reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by or to\nemployees in its investment banking division to or by employees on the \u201cpublic\u201d side of BofA Securities, including the employees who undertake these\nhedging and other market transactions. However, a portion of any gain or loss BANA experiences with respect to the Call Spread Transactions, including\nany termination payment, may be shared with BofA Securities\u2019 investment banking division.\nBANA has advised NuVasive that the announcement or occurrence of an acquisition transaction may cause BANA to recognize contractual\nbenefits or losses in connection with the Call Spread Transactions. In particular, BANA may recognize a benefit or loss owing to changes in the volatility\nof the shares of NuVasive Common Stock before announcement of the Merger relative to the volatility post announcement, (including of the acquiror\u2019s\nshares post consummation of the Merger) and the impact of such change on the value of the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions. However, as noted\nabove, under the Issuer Warrant Transaction, BANA is required to make an adjustment to preserve the transaction\u2019s fair value after taking into account\nthe Merger (or announcement thereof). As a result, BANA may suffer a contractual loss on its Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions, but have to forgo a\ncontractual benefit on the Issuer Warrant Transactions. For instance, BANA has advised NuVasive that, based on certain specified assumptions\n(including a share price of $55.00), if the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock increased as a result of the announcement or occurrence of the Merger by\n(including a share price of $55.00), if the volatility of NuVasive Common Stock increased as a result of the announcement or occurrence of the Merger by\n10% from 50% to 60%, BANA\u2019s portion of the liability under the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions could increase in value in favor of NuVasive (or its\nsuccessor) by approximately $566,000. By contrast, while the value of the Issuer Warrant Transactions to BANA on those same assumptions could\nincrease by approximately $1.1 million, BANA would be required to adjust the Issuer Warrant Transactions to preserve the fair value of\n \n-96-\nTable of Contents\nsuch transactions to NuVasive, thereby depriving BANA of such increase in value. As a further illustrative example, BANA has advised NuVasive that,\nbased on those same assumptions and assumed change in volatility but with an assumed stock price of $60.00, BANA\u2019s portion of the liability under the\nConvertible Bond Hedge Transactions could increase in value by approximately $857,000 and the value of the Issuer Warrant Transactions could increase\nby approximately $1.5 million.\nBANA advised NuVasive that, as the value changes described in the prior paragraph illustrate, the impact of any such changes to the Call Spread\nTransactions is likely to be limited because NuVasive\u2019s stock price was well below the strike prices for each Call Spread Transaction and, as noted above,\nthe Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions will expire in June 2023 and the Issuer Warrant Transactions expire in September to November 2023, all of which\nlimits the value of the Call Spread Transactions (and therefore the amount of any potential adjustments) as a whole. However, the amount of any such\ncontractual benefit or loss to BANA will depend on a number of factors as described above, including market conditions at the time, BANA\u2019s hedging\nactivities and when the Merger occurs relative to the maturities of the Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions and Issuer Warrant Transactions. There can\nbe no assurance that the market assumptions used in calculating such contractual benefit or loss to BANA will match or approximate actual market\nconditions and, thus, the actual magnitude of any benefit or loss to BANA may be greater or less than such estimate. The amount of any such\ncontractual benefit or loss will not be known until the Call Spread Transactions have been exercised, expired or terminated in accordance with their terms\nand BANA and its affiliates have completed all of their unwind activities.\nThe indenture governing the 2023 Convertible Notes and the confirmations containing the terms of the Call Spread Transactions were included as\nexhibits to NuVasive\u2019s report on Form 8-K filed by NuVasive with the SEC on May 27, 2020. All references in this section captioned \u201c\u2014Call Spread\nTransactions\u201d to share counts, conversion prices and strike prices may change from time to time in accordance with the terms of the relevant\nconfirmations.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters\nThe obligations of Globus and NuVasive to consummate the Merger are subject to, among other conditions, the expiration or earlier termination of\nany waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act.\nUnder the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed unless certain waiting period requirements have expired or\nbeen terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a notification and report form with the Antitrust Division of the United States\nDepartment of Justice (which we refer to as the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cFTC\u201d). A transaction\nnotifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties\u2019 filings of their respective\nnotification and report forms. If the Antitrust Division or the FTC issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (a \u201cSecond\nRequest\u201d) prior to the expiration of this initial 30-calendar-day waiting period, the transaction cannot close until the parties observe a second 30-calendar-\nday waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless such second waiting\nperiod is terminated earlier. The parties filed their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act on March 3, 2023. Unless extended or\nearlier terminated, the 30-calendar-day waiting period under the HSR Act will expire on April 3, 2023.\nAt any time before the Effective Time, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the\nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any state could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public\ninterest with respect to the Merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally approve the\nMerger upon the divestiture of assets, or to impose restrictions on the operations of NuVasive or Globus following the completion of the Merger. Private\nparties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the Merger will not be\nchallenged on antitrust grounds or, if such a challenge is made, that the challenge will not be successful.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Globus and NuVasive have agreed to use their respective reasonable best\nefforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to cause their respective directors, executive officers and other representatives to take, all actions, to file, or\ncause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or\nadvisable under applicable law to consummate and make effective the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as\nsoon as reasonably practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions, declarations,\napprovals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods from governmental bodies and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all\nsteps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval, clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a\nwaiting period by or from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental body in connection with any applicable law\u037e (ii) obtaining all\nnecessary consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties\u037e (iii) defending any lawsuit or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or\nadministrative, brought by any governmental body or third party challenging the Merger Agreement or seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit or\nmake illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and contesting any order that enjoins,\nrestrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,\nincluding, resolving any objections of or challenge made by any governmental body or third party to the merger or any other transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement under any antitrust law\u037e (iv) refraining from taking any other action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere\nwith, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger\u037e and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate\nthe Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n \n-108-Table of Contents\nIn furtherance of and consistent with Globus\u2019s obligation to use its reasonable best efforts, Globus has agreed to take, and to cause to be taken, all\nactions and things necessary, proper or advisable to eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law that is asserted by any governmental\nbody, to obtain the consent or cooperation of any other person, and to permit and cause the satisfaction of the closing relating to the expiration or earlier\ntermination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and the absence of legal restraints against the Merger, in each of the\nforegoing cases, to permit the closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, including:\n \n\u2022\nnegotiating, making proposals with respect to, committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,\nlease, license, divestiture or disposition of any assets, equity

any limitation or regulation on the ability of Globus or any of its affiliates to freely\nconduct their respective businesses or own such assets or limit or impair the ability of Globus or any of its affiliates to exercise full rights of\nownership of the shares of NuVasive Common Stock.\nHowever, (A) Globus is not required to propose, commit to, effect or agree to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,\ndivestiture, license, holding separate or other disposition of any business, asset, property or product line of NuVasive, Globus or any of their

action, or agree to any condition or restriction as requested by Globus if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or\nrestriction is binding on NuVasive only in the event the closing occurs. With respect to any action described in the bullet points immediately above,\nGlobus is required to consult with NuVasive and consider in good faith any efforts proposed by NuVasive to mitigate the adverse impact of any action on\nthe expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.",

Globus will be treated as the acquirer for accounting\npurposes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nOn March 16, 2023, a complaint, captioned O\u2019Dell v. NuVasive, Inc., et al., No. 1:23-cv-02262, was filed by a purported NuVasive stockholder in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York against NuVasive and its directors. The complaint alleges that the defendants filed or\ncaused to be filed a materially incomplete and misleading preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC which omitted material information\nrelating to the Merger in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff\u2019s requested relief,\namong others, includes an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger, requiring the defendants to disclose allegedly material\ninformation that was allegedly omitted from the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus, rescission of the Merger Agreement, rescissory damages,\nawarding costs and such other and further equitable relief as the court may deem just and proper. NuVasive and Globus believe that the claims asserted in\nthe complaint are without merit.\nAs of March 23, 2023, neither NuVasive nor Globus was aware of the filing of other lawsuits challenging the Merger or the joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. However, NuVasive and/or Globus stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger naming NuVasive, Globus, and\nmembers of their respective boards of directors and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits, including the\namount of costs associated with defending, settling, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of, such\nclaims.\nListing of Globus Common Stock\u037e Delisting and Deregistration of NuVasive Common Stock\nIt is a condition to the Merger that Globus Class A Common Stock to be issued to NuVasive stockholders in the Merger be approved for listing on\nNYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. If the Merger is completed, NuVasive Common Stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the\nExchange Act, following which NuVasive will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to NuVasive Common Stock.\n \n-110-\nTable of Contents",

No termination of the Merger Agreement will affect the\nobligations of the parties contained in the confidentiality agreement or the clean team agreement entered by NuVasive and Globus in connection with the\ntransaction, all of which will survive the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with their terms, except that the confidentiality agreement\nshall be deemed amended such that it will expire on the second anniversary of the termination of the Merger Agreement.\n \n-138-\nTable of Contents",

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Voting Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as\nAnnex B and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The description of the Voting Agreement in this section and elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Voting Agreement.\nVoting Commitment. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, until the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) a Globus Adverse Recommendation\nChange, (c) receipt of the approval of Globus stockholders for the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, and (d) such date and time as the Merger Agreement\nis validly terminated (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cExpiration Time\u201d), at every meeting of Globus stockholders at which the Globus Share\nIssuance Proposal is to be voted on (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), and on any action or approval of Globus stockholders by\nwritten consent with respect to the Globus Share Issuance Proposal, the Supporting Stockholders are required to vote all of their shares of Globus\nCommon Stock in accordance with the recommendation of the Globus Board as of the time of the Globus Special Meeting with respect to the Globus\nShare Issuance Proposal. Even though a special meeting is required to be held and all Globus stockholders of record on the Globus Record Date have a\nright to vote on the proposals presented at the Globus Special Meeting, the shares of Globus Class B Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement will\nbe sufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.\nUntil the Expiration Time, at every meeting of Globus stockholders (and at every adjournment or postponement thereof), the Supporting\nStockholders are required to be represented in person or by proxy at such meeting (or cause the holders of record on any applicable record date to be\nrepresented in person or by proxy at such meeting) in order for the Supporting Stockholders\u2019 shares of Globus Common Stock to be counted as present\nfor purposes of establishing a quorum.\nAs of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the shares of Globus Common Stock subject to the Voting Agreement represent\napproximately 70% of the total voting power of outstanding shares of Globus Common Stock and therefore such shares of Globus Common Stock are\nsufficient to approve the Globus Share Issuance Proposal and the Globus Adjournment Proposal.\nTransfer Restrictions. Until the Expiration Time, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed not to directly or indirectly transfer any of their shares of\nGlobus Common Stock, other than (i) with the prior written consent of NuVasive, or (ii) (a) to any member of their immediate family, or to a trust for the\nbenefit of the Supporting Stockholders or any member of their immediate family, or otherwise for estate planning purposes, (b) by will or under the laws of\nintestacy upon their death or (c) pursuant to a qualified domestic order\u037e provided, however, that the transfers described in clause (ii) are only permitted if\nthe transferee agrees in a written document, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to NuVasive, to be bound by all of the terms of the Voting\nAgreement.\nRegulatory Support. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger Agreement, the Supporting Stockholders are\nrequired to use their reasonable best efforts to assist and cooperate in obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any\nextension thereof) under the HSR Act, and have agreed not to take any action which would limit, impair or delay Globus in taking any action or making\nany commitment or otherwise complying with its regulatory efforts covenant set forth in the Merger Agreement (as described in the section of this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Regulatory Approvals\u201d). The Supporting Stockholders are not required to divest or agree to\nany restriction on any Globus Common Stock held by the Supporting Stockholders.\nNon-Solicitation. Until the Expiration Time, the Supporting Stockholders have agreed not to take any action that Globus is prohibited from taking\nunder the non-solicitation restrictions applicable to it under the Merger\n \n-142-Table of Contents\nAgreement (or permit any entity under their control to take such actions), as described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled \u201cThe\nMerger Agreement\u2014No Solicitation.\u201d\nTermination. The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate and will have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Time, except that the\nobligations described above under \u201cRegulatory Support\u201d will continue until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of the Merger\nAgreement.\nExclusive Remedy. The Voting Agreement provides that NuVasive\u2019s right to receive the one-time payment of the Globus Termination Fee (as\ndefined in the section titled \u201cMerger Agreement\u2014Termination Fees and Expenses\u201d) pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement will\nbe the sole and exclusive remedy available to NuVasive or any of its former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or\nrepresentatives against Globus or the Supporting Stockholders or any of Globus\u2019s respective former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers,\naffiliates, agents or representatives with respect to the Voting Agreement or any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Supporting Stockholders\ncontained in the Voting Agreement, and, upon such payment of the Globus Termination Fee, (i) in no event may NuVasive or any of its former, current or\nfuture equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or representatives seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on\na claim in law or equity with respect to any breach, termination or failure of or under the Voting Agreement and (ii) none of Globus or the Supporting\nStockholders or any of Globus\u2019s former, current or future equityholders, directors, officers, affiliates, agents or representatives will have any further\nliability relating to or arising out of the Voting Agreement. NuVasive has expressly waived the right to seek specific performance of the Supporting\nStockholders\u2019 obligations or covenants under the Voting Agreement and has agreed not to seek any injunction, order or other equitable remedy with\nrespect to the performance of the Supporting Stockholders\u2019 obligations under the Voting Agreement or the voting of their shares of Globus Common\nStock.\n \n-143-\nTable of Contents",

Under this method of accounting, the aggregate merger\nconsideration will be allocated to NuVasive\u2019s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of completion of\nthe Merger. The process of valuing the net assets of NuVasive immediately prior to the Merger, as well as evaluating accounting policies for conformity, is\npreliminary. Any differences between the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Accordingly, the aggregate Merger Consideration allocation and related adjustments reflected in this\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are preliminary and subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily\nindicative of what the Combined Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the combination occurred as of the\ndates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also should not be considered indicative of the future results of\noperations or financial position of Globus.\nThe pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information as required by SEC rules.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (amounts in thousands except per share amounts)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of SEC Regulation S-X as amended\nby the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 \u201cAmendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.\u201d Release No. 33-10786 replaces\nthe existing pro forma adjustment criteria with simplified requirements to depict the accounting for the transaction and present the reasonably estimable\nsynergies and other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (referred to as management adjustments). Globus has\nelected not to present management adjustments and will only be presenting transaction accounting adjustments related to the accounting for the Merger\n(the \u201cpro forma adjustments\u201d) in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The adjustments presented in the unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary to assist in understanding\nthe Combined Company upon consummation of the Merger.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been prepared by combining\nthe Globus and NuVasive statements of operations for the period and applying the related pro forma adjustments.\nThe pro forma adjustments have been prepared as if the Merger related to NuVasive occurred on December 31, 2022, for the unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined balance sheets and on January 1, 2022, for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The pro forma\nadjustments are based on currently available information and certain estimates and assumptions, and therefore the actual effects of these transactions\nwill differ from the pro forma adjustments.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Globus will control NuVasive, and accordingly will be the accounting acquirer. The unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information has been prepared by Globus using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. Under this method,\nthe aggregate consideration will be allocated to NuVasive\u2019s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their acquisition date estimated fair\nvalues. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be allocated to goodwill. The unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined financial information is based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets and liabilities to be acquired, which requires\nsignificant assumptions. Globus management believes that the assumptions used provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the\ntransactions and that the pro forma adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives appropriate effect to the\nassumptions. These assumptions may change upon the finalization of the fair value, which would have a corresponding impact on the pro forma financial\ninformation.\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the impact of any potential restructuring or integration\nactivities that have yet to be determined, nor the impact of possible cost or growth synergies expected to be achieved by the Combined Company, as no\nassurance can be made that such cost or growth synergies will be achieved.\nThe accounting policies followed in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are those used by Globus as set\nforth in the historical financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects any material adjustments known at\nthis time to conform NuVasive historical financial information to Globus\u2019s significant accounting policies based on Globus management\u2019s review of\nNuVasive\u2019s summary of significant accounting policies, as disclosed in the NuVasive historical financial statements. Globus does not have an existing\naccounting policy for ASU No. 2020-06, Debt\n \n-147-\nTable of Contents\nwith Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). Following the\nacquisition, Globus will adopt NuVasive\u2019s historical accounting policy, and amounts will be reflected within the condensed combined financial statements\naccordingly. Upon completion of the acquisition and a more comprehensive comparison and assessment, additional differences may be identified that\ncould have a material impact on the combined financial statements.\nThe consummation of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including NuVasive Stockholder Approval, Globus\nStockholder Approval, and regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the Merger will occur on or before a certain time on the terms\ndescribed herein, or at all.\n2. Preliminary Consideration\nThe preliminary consideration is calculated as follows:\n \n(In thousands, except share price and exchange ratio)\nShare Consideration:\nNuVasive shares outstanding\n53,208(i)\nGlobus exchange ratio\n0.75\nGlobus common shares to be issued in exchange for NuVasive shares\n39,906\nGlobus closing share price\n$\n60.50(ii)\n \n \n \n \nTotal estimated purchase price\n$2,414,314\n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\nThe NuVasive shares outstanding of 53,208 includes 52,192 shares of NuVasive Common Stock as of February 6, 2023 and 425 NuVasive RSU\nAwards and 591 NuVasive PRSU Awards expected to vest as of the merger date.\n(ii)\nThe share price is based on an assumed transaction date of February 16, 2023, and will be adjusted to reflect the estimated share price on the date\nof closing. Any change in the share price will have an associated impact on the total fair value of the consideration.\nThe estimated value of the consideration does not purport to represent the actual value of the total consideration that will be received by the\nNuVasive stockholders when the Merger is completed. The fair value of the equity securities issued as consideration will be measured on the closing date\nof the proposed Merger at the then-current market price per share of Globus Class A Common Stock. As a result of the subsequent fair value\nmeasurement of these securities, total consideration will likely change from what is presented in this calculation. For example, an increase or decrease of\n10% in the price of Globus Class A Common Stock on the closing date of the Merger compared to the price of Globus Class A Common Stock assumed in\nthe estimated fair value of the consideration would change the value of the preliminary consideration by approximately $241,431, which would be reflected\nas a corresponding increase or decrease to goodwill.\n3. Fair Value Estimate of Assets to be Acquired and Liabilities to be Assumed\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation based on management\u2019s preliminary estimate of their respective fair values is as follows:\n \n(In thousands)\nNuVasive\nFair Value\nAdjustment\nFair Value\nGoodwill\nCalculation\nTotal estimated purchase price\n$ 2,414,314\nInventory, net\n$\n338,601 $\n223,799\n(i)\n$\n562,400\nProperty & equipment, net\n346,510\n(21,898)\n(ii)\n324,612\nIntangible assets, net\n184,289\n924,285\n(iii)\n1,108,574\nAll other assets\n1,355,105\n(639,663)\n(iv)\n715,442\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal assets\n$ 2,224,505 $\n486,523\n$ 2,711,028\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-148-\nTable of Contents\n(In thousands)\nNuVasive\nFair Value\nAdjustment\nFair Value\nGoodwill\nCalculation\nDeferred income taxes\n$\n13,088 $\n252,285(v)\n$\n265,373\nSenior Convertible Notes\n892,258\n(45,414)(vi)\n846,844\nAll other liabilities\n450,269\n\u2014\n450,269\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal liabilities\n$ 1,355,615 $\n206,870\n$ 1,562,485\nFair value of net assets (excluding goodwill)\n$ 1,148,543\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEstimated Goodwill\n$ 1,265,771\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\nThe preliminary fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory utilizes a sales comparison approach which estimates the selling price\nof the inventory in completed condition less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.\n(ii)\nPreliminary fair value of property and equipment utilizes a combination of the cost approach, income approach, and sales comparison approach less\namounts for capitalized research and development costs existing on NuVasive\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n(iii)\nThe preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined using variations of the income approach, namely the multi-period\nexcess earnings and relief from royalty methodologies. The most significant assumptions applied in the development of the intangible asset fair\nvalues include: the amount and timing of future cash flows, the selection of discount and royalty rates, and the assessment of the asset\u2019s economic\nlife. Final identifiable intangible asset valuation results may differ from the pro forma estimates if the above assumptions and methodologies are\nmodified or if additional intangible assets are identified. The final valuation will be completed within 12 months of the completion of the merger.\n(iv)\nPreliminary fair value of other assets adjusted to eliminate historical goodwill from NuVasive\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n(v)\nPreliminary fair value of the deferred income tax liability was adjusted to reflect the estimated deferred tax impacts related to acquisition accounting\nadjustments primarily as a result of the step-up in fair value of intangible assets, inventory, and property and equipment. The incremental deferred\ntax impacts were calculated based on the tax effect of the estimated step-up in book basis of the net assets of NuVasive using an estimated\nstatutory tax rate of 24.0%. Tax expense was adjusted to record the income tax impacts of the merger adjustments using the same rate. This rate\ndoes not reflect the Combined Company\u2019s effective tax rate, which includes other items and may be significantly different than the rates assumed\nfor purposes of preparing these statements.\n(vi)\nPreliminary fair value of senior convertible notes due 2023 and 2025 was determined using trade price for note transactions on February 16, 2023.\nThe preliminary estimates were based on the data available to Globus and may change upon completion of the final purchase price allocation. Any\nchange in the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or the estimated fair value of the consideration will have a corresponding impact on\nthe amount of goodwill recorded. A change in identifiable intangible assets will have a direct impact on the amount of amortization recorded against\nincome in future periods. The impact of any changes in the purchase price allocation could have a material impact on the amounts presented in the\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in future periods.\n4. Pro forma Adjustments\n \n(A)\nReflects the impact on cash related to the Merger including the following:\n \n(In thousands)\nAmount\nPayment of transaction costs\n(i)\n$ 108,124\n \n \n \n \n \nPro forma adjustment\n$108,124\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\nRepresents the total estimated nonrecurring transaction costs.\n \n-149-\nTable of Contents\n(B)\nRepresents the impact of the preliminary purchase price allocation as described in Note 3, including:\n \n(i)\nIncrease in inventories to preliminary fair value, which considers book value for raw materials and margins and costs to complete for\nwork-in-process and finished goods. The fair value adjustment to inventories is estimated to be expensed over a period of 12 months,\nwhich is reflected as a pro forma adjustment in cost of sales. This charge will be included in the Combined Company\u2019s statement of\noperations subsequent to the merger and is expected to be released over the normal sales cycle, which is estimated to be\napproximately 12 months.\n \n(ii)\nRecognition of the property and equipment assets at the preliminary fair value, offset by the historical property and equipment assets\nof NuVasive and the associated impact on depreciation expense.

The goodwill, which is attributable to long-term advancements in Globus\u2019s technology, synergies in operations,\nthe assembled workforce, and growth through new channels to be achieved from the combined operations of Globus and NuVasive,\nrepresents the excess of total consideration over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe pro forma adjustments resulting from the purchase price allocation were based on preliminary estimates, as described above, and\nmay be revised upon finalization of the fair value estimates. The impact of such adjustments may have a material impact on the pro\nforma financial information. For example, an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair value of intangible assets on the closing date of\nthe Merger from the fair value of intangible assets assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information\nwould change the value of the intangible assets approximately by $166,286, which would be reflected as a corresponding increase or\ndecrease to straight-line amortization expense of $12,781 assuming an average useful life of 13,\n \n-150-\nTable of Contents\n14, and 10 years for developed technology, customer relationships, and tradenames and trademarks, respectively. Similarly, a change\nin the estimated purchase price of 10% would result in a change of $241,431 to the purchase price and a corresponding change in the\ngoodwill.\n \n(C)\nRepresents the impact of the amortization of the fair value adjustment into interest expense to NuVasive\u2019s 2023 convertible notes and 2025\nconvertible notes, over the remaining term of the respective notes.\n \n(In thousands, except years)\nPreliminary\nFair Value\nEstimated\nRemaining\nPeriod\n(in years)\nAmortization\nExpense\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\nSenior Convertible Notes due 2023\n$\n443,813\n1.4\n$\n3,002\nSenior Convertible Notes due 2025\n$\n403,031\n3.2\n$\n12,855\n \n(D)\nRepresents the elimination of NuVasive\u2019s historical equity balance and other adjustments, including the following:\n \n(In thousands)\nEliminate\nHistorical\nNuVasive\nShare\nConsideration\n(i)\nOther\nItems\n(ii)\nPro forma\nAdjustment\nCommon stock\n$\n(63)\n$\n2,414\n$\n\u2014\n$\n$2,351\nAdditional paid-in capital\n(1,469,411)\n2,411,899\n\u2014\n942,488\nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)\n3,249\n\u2014\n\u2014\n3,249\nRetained earnings\n(86,115)\n\u2014\n(95,149)\n(181,264)\nTreasury stock at cost\n683,450\n\u2014\n\u2014\n683,450\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n$ (868,890)\n$\n2,414,314\n$(95,149)\n$ 1,450,274\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\nRepresents the issuance of Globus shares as consideration based on the estimated share price of $60.50, which is the closing share\nprice on February 16, 2023 (See Note 2).\n \n(ii)\nRepresents the impact of the estimated nonrecurring transaction costs of $108,124, net of expected tax impact of $12,975.\n \n(E)\nReclassification of certain accounts to conform presentation between Globus and NuVasive, including:\n \n(i)\nReclassifies Globus\u2019s lease assets and liabilities under ASC 842 out of other assets for $5,988, accrued expenses for $2,536, and other\nliabilities for $3,475 and into operating lease right of use assets and the current and non-current portion of operating lease liabilities.\n \n(ii)\nReclassifies and aligns captions for NuVasive accrued expenses of $46,301 from accounts payable, and Globus accrued payroll and\nrelated expenses of $53,352 from accrued expenses, to align presentation for the Combined Company.\n \n(iii)\nReclassifies NuVasive\u2019s deferred revenue liability of $1,351 out of accounts payable and into deferred revenue.\n \n(iv)\nReclassifies and aligns the captions for prepaid income taxes of $7,118 and income taxes receivable to the same line.\n \n(v)\nReclassifies Globus\u2019s service sales of $16,945 and service cost of goods sold of $4,492 to the same line.\n \n(vi)\nReclassifies NuVasive\u2019s instrument and case depreciation out of selling, general, and administrative expense for $62,286 into product\ncost of goods sold.\n \n(vii)\nReclassifies NuVasive\u2019s freight expense of $30,586 related to the movement of inventory and instruments and cases out of selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expense into product cost of goods sold.\n \n-151-\nTable of Contents\n(viii) Reclassifies NuVasive\u2019s foreign currency transaction gain/(loss) for ($325) out of other income/(expense), net and into foreign\ncurrency transaction gain/(loss).\n \n(F)\nUnvested employee NuVasive RSU Awards and NuVasive PRSU Awards with double trigger change of control clauses will be assumed by\nGlobus and continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the award agreement, except that, instead of receiving NuVasive stock upon\nvesting, holders will receive shares of Globus stock based on the Exchange Ratio and revalued as of closing date under ASC 805. The pro\nforma adjustment of ($977) represents recurring stock-based compensation expense recognized under revalued awards based on the\nFebruary 16, 2023 Globus share price, as well as nonrecurring unrecognized expense of unvested nonemployee NuVasive RSU Awards and\nNuVasive PRSU Awards with single trigger change of control clauses.

        "Section Text": "INTERESTS OF NUVASIVE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER\nIn considering the recommendation of the NuVasive Board with respect to the NuVasive proposals, NuVasive stockholders should be aware that the\ndirectors and executive officers of NuVasive have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of NuVasive\nstockholders generally. The members of the NuVasive Board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating,\nnegotiating and approving the merger agreement and in determining to recommend that NuVasive stockholders approve the NuVasive Merger Proposal.\nFor more information, see the sections titled \u201cThe Merger\u2014Background of the Merger\u201d and \u201cThe Merger\u2014NuVasive\u2019s Reasons for the Merger and\nRecommendation of the NuVasive Board of Directors.\u201d Such interests are described in more detail below.\nThe NuVasive named executive officers included in the summary below are J. Christopher Barry, Chief Executive Officer\u037e Matthew K. Harbaugh,\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\u037e Nathaniel B. Sisitsky, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary\u037e and Dale Wolf,\nSenior Vice President, Global Operations. In addition, the one NuVasive executive officer who is covered by this summary who is not a named executive\nofficer is Michael Farrington, Senior Vice President, People and Culture. Massimo Calafiore and Brent J. Boucher are also deemed to be named executive\nofficers, but because they separated from employment with NuVasive on August 31, 2022 and September 1, 2021, respectively, they will not receive any\nbenefit that is payable or that may become payable that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger other than the Merger Consideration in respect of\nany shares of NuVasive Common Stock that they own, and they are not included in the disclosure below.  \nTreatment of NuVasive Equity Awards\nThe treatment of outstanding NuVasive equity awards held by NuVasive employees at the Effective Time is summarized below. The outstanding\nNuVasive equity awards held by NuVasive\u2019s executive officers will be treated in the same manner as those NuVasive equity awards held by other\nemployees of NuVasive and in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable to such awards before the Effective Time. The outstanding\nNuVasive equity awards held by NuVasive\u2019s non-employee members of the NuVasive Board will be treated in accordance with the terms and conditions\nthat were applicable to such awards before the Effective Time.\nTreatment of NuVasive RSU Awards. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each NuVasive RSU Award outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time will (1) if held by a non-employee member of the NuVasive Board, fully vest and be cancelled and converted into\nthe right to receive (without interest) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of NuVasive Common Stock underlying such NuVasive RSU\nAward, and (2) if not held by a non-employee member of the NuVasive Board, automatically be converted and assumed or replaced by Globus, in\naccordance with, and remaining subject to, the terms and conditions of the applicable NuVasive equity plan and award agreement by which it is\nevidenced, including any service-based vesting conditions, except that each such converted Globus award will be denominated in a number of shares of\nGlobus Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock subject to the applicable NuVasive RSU\nAward immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Globus Class A\nCommon Stock.\nTreatment of NuVasive PRSU Awards. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each NuVasive PRSU Award outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Effective Time (other than certain NuVasive PRSU Award held by consultants to NuVasive) will automatically be converted and\nassumed or replaced by Globus, in accordance with, and remaining subject to, the terms and conditions of the applicable NuVasive equity plan and award\nagreement by which it is evidenced as each is in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, including any service-based vesting conditions but\nexcluding any performance-based vesting conditions, except that each such assumed Globus award will be denominated in a number of shares of Globus\nClass A Common Stock equal to the product of (x) 100% of the target number of shares of NuVasive Common Stock subject to such NuVasive\n \n-154-Table of Contents\nPRSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to adjustment to reflect actual 2023 performance to the extent reasonably determinable prior\nto the Effective Time if the Effective Time occurs in the 2024 calendar year), multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of\nshares of Globus Class A Common Stock.\nThe estimated value of the unvested NuVasive equity awards held by each of the named executive officers is set forth below in \u201c \u2014Quantification\nof Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger.\u201d Based on the same assumptions set forth\nin such section (including the applicable footnotes to the table included in such section), (i) the estimated aggregate value that would be realized by the\nNuVasive executive officer who is not a named executive officer in respect of his unvested NuVasive equity awards upon a termination without \u201ccause\u201d or\nfor \u201cgood reason\u201d at the Effective Time is: NuVasive RSU Awards\u2014$1,127,694 and NuVasive PRSU Awards\u2014$251,090, and (ii) the estimated aggregate\nvalue that would be realized by the eight non-employee members of the NuVasive Board in respect of their unvested NuVasive RSU Awards is $1,353,680.\nChange in Control Agreements\nEach of NuVasive\u2019s executive officers is party to a change in control agreement that provides for certain severance benefits upon a termination of\nemployment by NuVasive other than for \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each, a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d) that occurs within two\nyears following a change in control. The Merger will constitute a change in control under the change in control agreements.\nThe change in control agreements provide for the following entitlements upon a qualifying termination within two years following a change in\ncontrol, subject to the executive officer\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims:\n \n\u2022\nReceive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of the following amounts:\n \n\u2022\nOne and one-half times (two times for Messrs. Barry and Harbaugh) the executive officer\u2019s \u201cannual compensation\u201d (defined as the\nsum of (x) one year of the executive officer\u2019s base salary at the highest rate at which the executive officer was paid at any time during\nthe 12 months prior to his separation from service and (y) the greater of (A) the executive officer\u2019s target annual bonus for the year in\nwhich the separation from service occurs and (B) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive officer out of the three prior bonuses\npaid to the executive officer prior to his separation from service)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nFor Messrs. Barry and Harbaugh, the product of (x) the highest grant date fair value of any long-term incentive award (cash and/or\nequity-based) granted to him in the three calendar year period prior to the calendar year of his separation from service and (y) a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial calendar months between January 1 of the year of separation from\nservice and the date of the executive officer\u2019s separation from service (provided that such numerator will not exceed six) and the\ndenominator of which is 12\u037e\n \n\u2022\nThe \u201cbenefit cash-out amount,\u201d meaning the product of (x) 229.56% and (y) the sum of (A) the total cost of the projected premiums\nfor group medical, dental and vision coverage, (B) the cost to NuVasive of providing the executive officer with group short- and long-\nterm disability, group term life, company-paid voluntary life and certain other benefits for a 24 month period, and (C) the cost to\nNuVasive of providing the executive officer with a qualified plan defined contribution match (assuming the executive officer makes the\nmaximum amount of employee contributions allowed under such plan), in each case for 24 months following the executive officer\u2019s\nseparation from service\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nThe product of (x) the greater of (A) the executive officer\u2019s target annual bonus amount for the year in which the separation of service\noccurs and (B) the highest annual bonus paid to the executive officer out of the three prior bonuses paid to him prior to his separation\nfrom service\n \n-155-\nTable of Contents\nand (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial calendar months between January 1 of the year of\nseparation from service and the date of the executive officer\u2019s separation from service, and the denominator of which is 12\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nBecome fully vested in all equity and long-term incentive awards granted to the executive officer, with the final number of units and/or\nshares payable under any performance shares or performance unit awards determined in accordance with the applicable grant\nagreement. In addition, pursuant to the applicable NuVasive RSU Award or NuVasive PRSU Award agreements, if the executive officer\nis terminated without cause at any time following a change in control, the award will become vested upon termination.\nThe change in control agreements also contain provisions relating to the length of the exercise period applicable to any stock options or stock\nappreciation rights held by the executive officer following a qualifying termination, however, none of the executive officers holds any NuVasive stock\noptions or stock appreciation rights. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to or in connection with the change in\ncontrol agreements, NuVasive will reimburse the executive officer for reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses incurred if the executive officer\nsubstantially prevails on the merits with respect to any breach of the agreement by NuVasive.\nFor an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to NuVasive\u2019s named executive officers under\ntheir change in control agreements upon a qualifying termination in connection with the Merger, see the section titled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential\nPayments and Benefits to NuVasive\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger.\u201d Based on the same assumptions set forth in such\nsection (including the applicable footnotes to the table included in such section), the estimated aggregate amount of the lump sum cash severance\npayment (including all components described above) that would be payable to the NuVasive executive officer who is not a named executive officer under\nhis change in control agreement is $1,241,761.\nNuVasive Excise Tax Gross-Up Plan\nIn connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, on February 8, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the NuVasive Board adopted the\nNuVasive, Inc. Excise Tax Gross-Up Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) to provide each executive officer with the right to receive a gross-up payment in the event that any\npayments or benefits provided to such executive officer in connection with the Merger become subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the\nInternal Revenue Code. The payments would generally place each participant in the same after-tax position that they would have been in if the excise tax\ndid not apply to such executive officer, subject to an aggregate $4 million cap on the total amount of gross-up payments that may be made to participants\nunder the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a participant\u2019s payments or benefits exceed his applicable Section 280G safe harbor amount\nby 10% or less, the participant will instead receive a reduction of payments and benefits to the extent necessary to cause the payments not to become\nsubject to the excise tax. The Plan was adopted solely in connection with the Merger and therefore will automatically terminate if the Merger Agreement is\nterminated without the consummation of the Merger.\nFor an estimate of the value of the gross-up payments described above that would be payable under the Plan to NuVasive\u2019s named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger, see the section titled \u201c \u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive\u2019s Named Executive\nOfficers in Connection with the Merger.\u201d Based on the same assumptions set forth in such section (including the applicable footnotes to the table\nincluded in such section), the estimated aggregate amount of the gross-up payments that would be payable to the NuVasive executive officer who is not a\nnamed executive officer under the Plan is $1,127,933.\n2023 Annual Bonus Plan\nGlobus and NuVasive have agreed that the Compensation Committee of the NuVasive Board is permitted to take action to determine the level of\nachievement of the applicable performance goals under the NuVasive 2023\n \n-156-\nTable of Contents\nannual bonus plan in respect of the portion of the 2023 performance year elapsed prior to the Effective Time, based on the greater of 75% of target\nperformance and actual performance for any fully completed performance period within the 2023 performance year (consisting of first half of 2023, third\nquarter of 2023, and fourth quarter of 2023) and based on target performance for the performance period within the 2023 performance year in which the\nEffective Time occurs. Such performance determination will govern the amount of the 2023 annual incentive awards to be paid after the Effective Time to\nemployees, including executive officers, who remain employed and eligible to receive a full year bonus.  \nMembership on the Globus Board and Post-Closing Services\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, Globus has agreed to take all necessary action to cause, as of the Effective Time, an increase in the size of the\nGlobus Board to eleven directors, and to authorize and effect the appointment of three additional directors from the NuVasive Board, proposed by the\nNuVasive Board and acceptable to the Globus Board. Each such additional NuVasive designated director will serve on the Globus Board until such\nindividual\u2019s successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law. One of each of the three additional NuVasive\ndesignated directors will be appointed as a member of each of the three classes of directors serving on the Globus Board. In the event any such NuVasive\nDirector is or becomes unable or unwilling prior to the Effective Time to serve on the Globus Board in the role identified, a replacement for such director\nwill be determined prior the Effective Time pursuant to the process set forth above. Non-employee members of the Globus Board will be compensated for\nsuch service. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no decisions have been made as to the members of the NuVasive Board who will\nserve on the Globus Board following the Effective Time. For additional information, see \u201cThe Merger\u2014Governance Matters After the Merger.\u201d\nIn addition, it is possible that certain of NuVasive\u2019s executive officers may continue to provide services to Globus after the Effective Time. Any of\nNuVasive\u2019s executive officers who become officers or employees or are otherwise retained to provide services to Globus or the Surviving Corporation\nmay, prior to, at or following the Effective Time, enter into new individualized compensation arrangements with Globus or the Surviving Corporation and\nmay participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Globus or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, it has not been determined which, if any, executive officers may continue as members of the Globus management team or the\npositions that such individuals may hold after the Merger, and no new individualized compensation arrangements between Globus and any of NuVasive\u2019s\nexecutive officers have been agreed or established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Globus agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or\nomissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of the present and former directors, officers, and employees of NuVasive or any of its\nsubsidiaries as provided in NuVasive\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 organizational documents, and specified indemnification agreements of NuVasive and its\nsubsidiaries in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their\nterms. Globus agreed to cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational documents of NuVasive\u2019s\nsubsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities of present\nand former directors, officers, and employees of NuVasive or its subsidiaries than are currently provided in NuVasive\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 organizational\ndocuments.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, Globus and the Surviving Corporation agreed to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person\nwho is or was a current or former director or officer of NuVasive or any of its subsidiaries against all obligations to pay any threatened, asserted, pending\nor completed judgment, damages, settlement, losses, liabilities, or fine or penalty, interest and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any\naction, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, and whether formal or\n \n-157-\nTable of Contents\ninformal, by reason of the fact that the indemnified party is or was an officer or director of NuVasive or its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior\nto, at, or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent provided for under applicable law, NuVasive\u2019s organizational documents, the organizational\ndocuments of NuVasive\u2019s subsidiaries and certain indemnification agreements of NuVasive and its subsidiaries.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, NuVasive may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a tail policy or policies under the current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019\nliability insurance policies maintained at such time by NuVasive, and if NuVasive does not obtain such tail policy or policies prior to the Effective Time,\nGlobus or the Surviving Corporation are required to obtain such policy or policies.\nThis indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section titled \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Indemnification of Officer and\nDirectors.\u201d\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to NuVasive\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\nThis section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each of NuVasive\u2019s named\nexecutive officers that is based on or that otherwise relates to the Merger. The Merger-related compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a\nnon-binding advisory vote of NuVasive\u2019s stockholders, as described above in \u201cNuVasive Proposal 2: Advisory Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related\nCompensation for Named Executive Officers.\u201d The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this Merger-related compensation disclosure, the amount\nof payments and benefits that each NuVasive named executive officer would receive, using the following assumptions:\n \n\u2022\nThe Effective Time occurs on March 6, 2023 (which is an assumed date solely for the purposes of the calculations in this section)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nEach named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment under his change in control agreement immediately\nfollowing the Effective Time (or a termination without cause under each applicable NuVasive RSU Award or NuVasive PRSU Award\nagreement immediately following the Effective Time)\u037e\n \n\u2022\nA price per share of NuVasive common stock of $44.67, the average closing price per share over the first five business days following the\nfirst public announcement of the Merger Agreement on February 9, 2023\u037e\n \n\u2022\nWith respect to the tax reimbursement payments under the Plan, assumes that the value of the non-competition covenants to which Messrs.\nBarry, Harbaugh and Wolf are subject is equal to 50% of such named executive officer\u2019s total target direct compensation for the restricted\nperiod applicable to such named executive officer, and that all such amounts are deemed to be reasonable compensation for purposes of\ndetermining the amount of the named executive officer\u2019s parachute payments for purposes of Section 280G of the Code.\nThe calculations in the table do not include amounts that NuVasive\u2019s named executive officers were already vested in as of the date of this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus. These amounts also do not reflect compensation actions that may occur after the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus but before the Effective Time, including any additional equity grants.\nAs a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions\ndescribed in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set\nforth below.\nFor purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, \u201csingle trigger\u201d refers to payments and benefits that arise solely as a result of the completion of\nthe Merger and \u201cdouble trigger\u201d refers to payments and benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the Merger and a qualifying\ntermination of employment.\n \n-158-\nTable of Contents\nGolden Parachute Compensation\n \nNamed Executive Officer(4)\nCash ($)(1)\nEquity ($)(2)\nTax\nReimbursement($)(3)\nTotal ($)\nJ.

        "Section Text": "MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER\nThe following discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of shares\nof NuVasive Common Stock that exchange their shares of NuVasive Common Stock for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock in the Merger. The\ndiscussion is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as\ncurrently in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) and differing interpretations. Any such\nchange or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Tax\nconsiderations arising under foreign, state or local laws, or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income tax (such as estate or gift\ntax laws), are not addressed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \u201cU.S. holder\u201d refers to a beneficial owner of NuVasive Common Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes:\n \n\u2022\nan individual citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n \n\u2022\na corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any of its political subdivisions\u037e\n \n\u2022\na trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more\nUnited States persons (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) such trust has made\na valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person\u037e or\n \n\u2022\nan estate that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its income regardless of its source.\nThis discussion applies only to U.S. holders of NuVasive Common Stock that hold their shares of NuVasive Common Stock as a capital asset within\nthe meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is not a complete description of all of the tax\nconsequences of the Merger and, in particular, does not address any consequences arising under the alternative minimum tax, unearned income Medicare\ncontribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the\nU.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith). This\ndiscussion also does not address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular U.S. holder in light of its personal circumstances\nor to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example:\n \n\u2022\nbanks, thrifts, mutual funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions\u037e\n \n\u2022\npartnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities (or investors in partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities)\u037e\n \n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations\u037e\n \n\u2022\ndealers or brokers in stocks, securities, commodities, or currencies\u037e\n \n\u2022\ntraders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting\u037e\n \n\u2022\nindividual retirement or other deferred accounts\u037e\n \n\u2022\npersons that hold shares of NuVasive Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedge, appreciated financial position, constructive sale,\nconversion, integrated or other risk reduction transaction\u037e\n \n\u2022\nregulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts\u037e\n \n\u2022\nU.S. holders whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n \n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates\u037e\n \n-160-Table of Contents\n\u2022\npersons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an \u201capplicable\nfinancial statement\u201d\u037e\n \n\u2022\nholders who, directly, indirectly or constructively own (or at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the Merger owned)\n5% or more of NuVasive Common Stock\u037e and\n \n\u2022\nstockholders who acquired their shares of NuVasive Common Stock through the exercise of employee stock options, as a restricted stock\naward or otherwise as compensation.\nIf a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of NuVasive Common\nStock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and partnership.\nPartnerships holding shares of NuVasive Common Stock and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors about the tax\nconsequences of the merger to them.\nThis discussion is not tax advice and does not purport to be a complete analysis or discussion of all U.S. federal income tax considerations\nrelating to the Merger. The actual tax consequences of the Merger to you may be complex and may depend on your specific situation and on factors not\nwithin Globus\u2019s or NuVasive\u2019s control. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Merger in your particular\ncircumstances, including any federal, state, local or foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\nGlobus and NuVasive intend for the Merger to qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. NuVasive and Globus must use reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion from external counsel, dated the closing date, to the\neffect that the Merger will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. That opinion will be based on representation\nletters provided by Globus and NuVasive and on any other information as external counsel determines for purposes of rendering such opinion. That\nopinion will not be binding on the IRS and neither Globus nor NuVasive has requested or intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a\nposition contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations, warranties, covenants or assumptions (including\nthe assumption that the Merger will be completed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and as described in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus) upon which the opinion described above will be based are inconsistent with the actual facts, or if any condition contained in the\nMerger Agreement and affecting the opinion is breached or is waived by any party, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger could be\nadversely affected.\nProvided the Merger qualifies as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of the Merger to U.S. holders generally are as follows. U.S. holders of NuVasive Common Stock who exchange their shares of NuVasive\nCommon Stock for shares of Globus Class A Common Stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with\nrespect to cash, if any, received in lieu of fractional shares of Globus Class A Common Stock (taxed in the manner described below). Each U.S. holder\u2019s\naggregate tax basis in the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock received in the Merger (including any fractional share deemed received and sold for\ncash, as discussed below) will equal such U.S. holder\u2019s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares of NuVasive Common Stock exchanged in the Merger.\nThe holding period of the shares of Globus Class A Common Stock received by a U.S. holder in the Merger (including any fractional share deemed\nreceived and sold for cash, as discussed below) will include such U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for the shares of NuVasive Common Stock exchanged in\nthe Merger. If a U.S. holder holds different blocks of NuVasive Common Stock (generally, NuVasive Common Stock acquired on different dates or at\ndifferent prices), such U.S. holder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the determination of the tax bases and/or holding periods of the particular\nshares of Globus Class A Common Stock received in the Merger.\n \n-161-\nTable of Contents\nA U.S. holder of shares of NuVasive Common Stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock generally will\nbe treated as having received the fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and then as having sold that fractional share\nfor cash. As a result, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the tax\nbasis in such fractional share (determined as described above). Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital\ngain or loss if, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, the holding period for the shares (including the holding period of the NuVasive Common Stock\nsurrendered therefor) is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPayments of cash to U.S. holders in lieu of a fractional share of Globus Class A Common Stock in connection with the Merger generally will be\nsubject to information reporting and may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 24%). To prevent backup withholding, U.S.\nholders of NuVasive Common Stock should (1) furnish the exchange agent for the Merger (or other payor) with a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or an\napplicable substitute or successor form) certifying such U.S. holder\u2019s correct taxpayer identification number and that such U.S. holder is not subject to\nbackup withholding and otherwise comply with all the applicable backup withholding rules or (2) otherwise establish an applicable exemption from\nbackup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder of shares of NuVasive Common\nStock under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against such U.S. holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that such U.S.\nholder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.\nThe preceding discussion is intended only as an overview of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger and is not tax\nadvice. It is not a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax considerations that may be important to you. Thus, you are strongly encouraged to\nconsult your tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences resulting from the Merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability\nand effect of federal, state, local and other tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.\n \n-162-\nTable of Contents",

        "Section Text": "COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 RIGHTS\nThis section describes the material differences between the rights of holders of shares of NuVasive Common Stock and the rights of holders of\nshares of Globus Class A Common Stock. NuVasive and Globus are each incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and, accordingly, the\nrights of NuVasive stockholders and Globus stockholders are both governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

As a\nresult of the Merger, holders of shares of NuVasive Common Stock that receive shares of Globus Class A Common Stock will become stockholders of\nGlobus. Accordingly, following the Merger, the rights of NuVasive stockholders who become Globus stockholders will continue to be governed by the\nlaws of the State of Delaware and will also then be governed by the Globus charter and Globus bylaws.\nThis section does not include a complete description of all of the differences between the rights of NuVasive stockholders and Globus\nstockholders, nor does it include a complete description of the specific rights referred to below.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this\nAgreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of\nParent Class A Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the aggregate net cash\nproceeds as determined below and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is such fractional part of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock, and the\ndenominator is the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all\nfractional entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock. As promptly as possible following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell at\nthen-prevailing prices on the NYSE such number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents\nthe aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock, with the cash proceeds (net of all commissions, transfer taxes and\nother out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sales) of such sales to be used by the Exchange Agent\nto fund the foregoing payments in lieu of fractional shares. The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional\nshares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Article III was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents mechanical\nrounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of\nParent Class A Common Stock.\n \nA-24\nTable of Contents\n(b) All calculations performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be calculated to four decimal places (e.g. 0.0001), where\napplicable.\n(c) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to the Company Stockholders in connection with the\nMerger.\nSection 3.06.

Any such withheld or deducted amounts as are timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body shall be treated as though such\namount had been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was determined to be necessary.\nSection 3.07. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the\nnumber of shares Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common\nStock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time, in either case, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock\ndividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the consideration paid in\naccordance with this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change\u037e provided, that nothing in this Section 3.07 shall be construed to\npermit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.\nSection 3.08. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Company to be necessary or\ndesirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to rights and\nproperty of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of Parent shall be further authorized to take such action.
