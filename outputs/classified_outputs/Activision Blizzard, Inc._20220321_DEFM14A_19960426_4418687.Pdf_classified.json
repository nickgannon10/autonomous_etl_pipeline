You will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of\nActivision Blizzard common stock you owned as of the close of business on the record date.\nQuorum\nThe presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding\nshares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum at\nthe special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 780,922,900 shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a validly executed proxy\nby mail, telephone or the Internet, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In addition, abstentions will\nbe counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of\nestablishing a quorum. As a result, 390,461,451 shares of Activision Blizzard common stock must be\nrepresented, in person or by proxy, to have a quorum. In the event that a quorum is present at the special\nmeeting and there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal,\nit is expected that the special meeting would be adjourned to allow time to solicit additional proxies if the\nholders of a majority of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in\nperson or by proxy, approve an adjournment. If a quorum is not present, the special meeting may be (and it is\nexpected that the special meeting would be) adjourned by the presiding person of the meeting pursuant to\nthe authority granted in Activision Blizzard\u2019s bylaws until a quorum is obtained, subject to the terms of the\nmerger agreement.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\noutstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger proposal, which we refer to as\n\u201cstockholder approval.\u201d This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d\nthat proposal is greater than 50% of the total number of shares of our outstanding common stock as of the\nrecord date. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger\nproposal.\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\nentitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present, is required to\napprove, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related compensation proposal. This means\nthat the proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d that proposal is greater than 50% of\nthe total number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in\n4 \n",

If you wish to vote your shares by virtual ballot at our special meeting, you must\nobtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or similar institution, granting you authorization to\nvote your shares.\nIf you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your\nproxy, your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be voted in accordance with your\ninstructions.\nEven if you plan to virtually attend the special meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your\nshares of Activision Blizzard common stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain\na valid legal proxy to vote shares which you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock by virtual ballot at the special meeting even if you have previously\nauthorized your vote by proxy. If you are present at the special meeting and vote by virtual ballot, your\nprevious vote by proxy will not be counted.\nCan I change or revoke my proxy?\nFor stockholders of record: Yes. A proxy may be changed or revoked at any time prior to its exercise at\nthe special meeting by submitting a later-dated proxy (including a proxy submitted via the Internet or by\ntelephone) or by giving written notice to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at\n17 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nActivision Blizzard, Inc., 2701 Olympic Boulevard, Building B, Santa Monica, CA 90404. You may not\nchange your vote over the Internet or by telephone after 8:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 27, 2022. You\nmay also attend the special meeting and vote your shares by virtual ballot.\nFor holders in street name: Yes. You must follow the specific voting instructions provided to you by\nyour broker, bank or other nominee to change or revoke any instructions you have already provided to\nthem.\nHow will my shares be voted if I do not provide specific instructions in the proxy card or voting instruction form\nthat I submit?\nIf you are a stockholder of record and if you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not provide\nspecific voting instructions, your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the\nmerger proposal, \u201cFOR\u201d the merger-related compensation proposal and \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment\nproposal.\nIf your shares are held in street name at a broker, bank or similar institution, your broker, bank or similar\ninstitution may, under certain circumstances, vote your shares on \u201cdiscretionary\u201d matters if you do not\ntimely provide voting instructions in accordance with the instructions provided by them. However, if\nyou do not provide timely instructions, your broker, bank or similar institution does not have the\nauthority to vote on any \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d proposals at the special meeting and a \u201cbroker non-vote\u201d\nwould occur, as explained in the following question and explanation.\nWhat is \u201cbroker discretionary voting\u201d?\nIf you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other nominee may be able to vote your\nshares without your instructions depending on whether the matter being voted on is \u201cdiscretionary\u201d or\n\u201cnon-discretionary.\u201d Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have\ndiscretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals, if a beneficial owner of shares\nof Activision Blizzard common stock does not give voting instructions to the applicable broker, bank or\nother nominee with respect to any of the proposals, then those shares will not be present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at the special meeting. If there are any broker non-votes, then such broker non-\nvotes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal, but will not have any effect\non the merger-related compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal (assuming there is a quorum).\nTherefore, it is important that you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote\nyour shares.\nI understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the special meeting. What constitutes a\nquorum?\nThe presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding\nshares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum\nat the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 780,922,900 shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. If you submit a properly executed\nproxy by mail, telephone or the Internet, or attend the special meeting, you will be considered a part of\nthe quorum. In addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-\nvotes will not be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. As a result, 390,461,451 shares must be\nrepresented, in person or by proxy, to have a quorum. In the event that a quorum is present at the\nspecial meeting and there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the\nmerger proposal, it is expected that the special meeting would be adjourned to allow time to solicit\nadditional proxies if the holders of a majority of the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled\nto vote which are present, in person or by proxy, approve an adjournment. If a quorum is not present,\nthe special meeting may be (and it is expected that the special meeting would be) adjourned by the\npresiding person of the meeting pursuant to the authority granted in Activision Blizzard\u2019s bylaws until a\nquorum is obtained, subject to the terms of the merger agreement.\n18 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhat is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the annual meeting?\nThe merger proposal: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Activision\nBlizzard common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger\nproposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted \u201cFOR\u201d that\nproposal is greater than 50% of the total number of the votes that can be cast as of the record date in\nrespect of outstanding shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes\nwill have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger proposal.\nThe merger-related compensation proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the\nshares of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy,\nprovided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the\nmerger-related compensation proposal. This means that the proposal will be approved if the number of\nshares voted \u201cFOR\u201d that proposal is greater than 50% of the shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present.\nAbstentions will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the merger-related compensation proposal,\nand broker non-votes will not have any effect on the merger-related compensation proposal (assuming a\nquorum is present).\nThe adjournment proposal: The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock entitled to vote which are present, in person or by proxy, provided a\nquorum is present, is required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting. Whether or not\nthere is a quorum, the presiding person at the special meeting has the power to adjourn the special\nmeeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote\n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the adjournment proposal, and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the\nadjournment proposal (assuming a quorum is present).\nHow can I obtain a proxy card or voting instruction form?\nIf you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card or a voting instruction form, please follow\nthe applicable procedure below.\nFor stockholders of record: Please contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 687-\n1871 from the U.S. or Canada or at +1 (412) 232-3651 from other locations.\nFor holders in street name: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other\nnominee.\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will or may become\npayable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?\nSEC rules require Activision Blizzard to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive officers in connection\nwith the merger.\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive officers\nin connection with the merger for purposes of this advisory vote?\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by Activision Blizzard to its named executive\nofficers in connection with the merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and\npayable to certain of Activision Blizzard\u2019s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and\narrangements that are contractual in nature, including amounts payable in accordance with the terms of\nthe merger agreement. Compensation that will or may become payable by Microsoft to Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger is not subject to this advisory vote.\nFor further detail, see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 2: Advisory Vote on Merger-\nRelated Executive Compensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page 95.\nShould I send in my stock certificates now?\nNo. After the merger is completed, under the terms of the merger agreement, you will receive shortly\nthereafter the letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificates or surrender your\nbook-entry shares to the paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration\nfor\n19 \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\neach share of your Activision Blizzard common stock represented by the stock certificates or book-entry\nshares. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment\nto which you are entitled upon completion of the merger. Please do not send in your stock certificates\nnow.\nI do not know where my stock certificates are. How will I get the merger consideration for my shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock?\nIf the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger\nwill include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificates. This will\ninclude an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may\nalso be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss.\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Activision Blizzard common stock after the close of\nbusiness on the record date but before the special meeting?\nThe record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be\ncompleted. If you sell or transfer your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock after the close of\nbusiness on the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the\nprovision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your\nshares and each of you notifies Activision Blizzard by giving written notice to our Corporate Secretary\nat our principal executive offices at Activision Blizzard, Inc., 2701 Olympic Boulevard, Building B, Santa\nMonica, CA 90404 of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share\nmerger consideration if the merger is completed to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares\nof Activision Blizzard common stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the special\nmeeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock after the\nclose of business on the record date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed\nproxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone.\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nWe are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete\nthe merger in Microsoft\u2019s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. However, the exact timing of completion of\nthe merger cannot be predicted because the completion of the merger is subject to conditions, including\nthe adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not\ncompleted for any other reason, Activision Blizzard stockholders will not receive any payment for their\nshares of Activision Blizzard common stock. Instead, Activision Blizzard will remain an independent\npublic company, Activision Blizzard common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and\nregistered under the Exchange Act, and Activision Blizzard will continue to file periodic reports with the\nSEC.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Activision Blizzard will be required to pay Microsoft a\ntermination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 92.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Microsoft will be required to pay Activision Blizzard a reverse\ntermination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fReverse Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 93.\nAre there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?\nYes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See the section\nentitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 24.\n20 \nQ: \nA: \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nDo any of Activision Blizzard\u2019s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of\nActivision Blizzard stockholders generally?\nYes.

Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory\nvote, if the merger is completed, Activision Blizzard may still pay such compensation to its named\nexecutive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such compensation.\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement\nand multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nPROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT\nTHE MERGER\nThis discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is\nattached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You\nshould read the entire merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.\nCertain Effects of the Merger on Activision Blizzard\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the applicable\nprovisions of the DGCL, on the closing date and at the effective time, Sub will merge with and into Activision\nBlizzard, with Activision Blizzard continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of\nMicrosoft. Activision Blizzard expects to delist its common stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable\nafter the effective time and deregister its common stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable\nafter such delisting. Thereafter, Activision Blizzard will no longer be a publicly traded company. If the merger\nis completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation, and instead will\nonly be entitled to receive the merger consideration, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the\nMerger Agreement - Conversion of Shares - Common Stock\u201d beginning on page 75.\nThe effective time will occur upon the filing and acceptance of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of\nState of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sub may agree in\nwriting and specify in the certificate of merger).\nEffect on Activision Blizzard if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not adopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not completed\nfor any other reason, Activision Blizzard stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock. Instead, Activision Blizzard will remain an independent public company,\nActivision Blizzard common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the\nExchange Act and Activision Blizzard will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger\nnot to be consummated, it is likely that the price of Activision Blizzard common stock will decline\nsignificantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Activision Blizzard common stock\nwould return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Activision Blizzard common stock. If the merger is not\nconsummated, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s business operations, assets and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are\ndeemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the merger agreement is not\nadopted by Activision Blizzard stockholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there\ncan be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Activision Blizzard or its stockholders will be\noffered or that Activision Blizzard\u2019s business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely\nimpacted.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Activision Blizzard will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee\nof $2,270,100,000 upon the termination of the merger agreement, as described under the section entitled\n\u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 92.\nUnder certain specified circumstances, Microsoft will be required to pay Activision Blizzard a reverse\ntermination fee of an amount ranging from $2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 upon the termination of the\nmerger agreement, as described under the section entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement - Reverse\nTermination Fee\u201d beginning on page 93.\n31 ",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nBackground of the Merger\nThe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors and senior management team regularly review Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s performance, future growth prospects and overall strategic direction and consider potential\nopportunities to strengthen Activision Blizzard\u2019s business and enhance stockholder value. These reviews\nhave included consideration of whether the continued execution of Activision Blizzard\u2019s strategy or possible\nstrategic opportunities, including acquisitions, dispositions, commercial partnerships or combinations with\nthird parties, offered the best avenue to maximize stockholder value. In addition, the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors and senior management from time to time have been approached by third parties\nexpressing an interest in exploring a potential strategic combination with or acquisition of Activision\nBlizzard, but, since the reduction of Vivendi\u2019s ownership stake in Activision Blizzard in 2013, no such\ndiscussions have advanced beyond preliminary discussions gauging each party\u2019s respective interest in\npursuing a transaction or resulted in any specific proposal on price, structure or other material terms.\nFor over 20 years, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft have maintained an ongoing commercial relationship.\nWhile the companies have certain commercial arrangements relating to the licensing of various products and\nservices, their principal business relationship relates to the publishing of products and services for the Xbox\ngaming platform. This relationship began over 20 years ago, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive officer of\nActivision Blizzard, and Phil Spencer, the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming, maintain a regular\ndialogue about the commercial relationship and the gaming industry generally. From time to time, Satya\nNadella, the chief executive officer of Microsoft, and Mr. Kotick have also spoken about similar matters.\nOn November 19, 2021, in the course of a conversation on a different topic between Mr. Spencer and Mr.\nKotick, Mr. Spencer raised that Microsoft was interested in discussing strategic opportunities between\nActivision Blizzard and Microsoft and asked whether it would be possible to have a call with Mr. Nadella the\nfollowing day. Mr. Kotick agreed to participate in such discussion. Following this call, Mr. Kotick promptly\nreported the conversation to Robert Morgado, the lead independent director on the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors, and Brian Kelly, the chairman of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. Messrs.\nKotick and Kelly subsequently spoke with Allen & Company LLC, which we refer to as \u201cAllen & Company,\u201d\nwhich had provided strategic financial advice to Activision Blizzard on other occasions, regarding the call\nwith Mr. Spencer.\nIn a call on November 20, 2021, between Messrs. Kotick and Nadella, Mr. Nadella indicated that Microsoft\nwas interested in exploring a strategic combination with Activision Blizzard. Following this call, Mr. Kotick\npromptly discussed the call with Messrs. Morgado and Kelly and, thereafter, with a representative of\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, outside legal counsel to Activision Blizzard, which we refer to as\n\u201cSkadden.\u201d\nOn November 22, 2021, a call was held with Messrs. Spencer, Kotick and Kelly, during which call Mr. Spencer\nnoted that, while Microsoft already had a significant amount of information about Activision Blizzard and its\nbusiness as a result of the commercial relationship between the companies, Microsoft would need additional\ninformation regarding Activision Blizzard\u2019s long-range financial plan and prospects in order to advance its\nanalysis. Subsequently, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly indicated to Mr. Spencer that Activision Blizzard was not\nwilling to provide such information without an indication of the proposal that Microsoft would be prepared\nto make that could then be shared with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to gauge the Board\u2019s level\nof interest in engaging in additional discussions. Following this call, Robert Corti, chair of the Audit\nCommittee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, was also informed of Microsoft\u2019s expressed interest\nin potentially pursuing a transaction.\nOn November 26, 2021, Mr. Spencer again spoke with Messrs. Kotick and Kelly, indicating that, based on the\ninformation available to Microsoft, Microsoft was preliminarily considering making an all-cash acquisition\nproposal for Activision Blizzard at $80.00 per share. Thereafter, Messrs. Kotick, Kelly, Corti and Morgado\ndiscussed potential ranges at which the full Activision Blizzard Board of Directors may be willing to consider\nan acquisition proposal taking into consideration, among other factors, Activision Blizzard\u2019s historical\ntrading prices, selected research analysts\u2019 estimates for Activision Blizzard and relative trading multiples of\nActivision Blizzard and its peers.\n32 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn November 28, 2021, based on discussions with Messrs. Kelly, Corti and Morgado, Mr. Kotick\ncommunicated to Mr. Spencer that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors might be willing to entertain a\nproposal, and potentially to engage in discussions relating to a potential strategic combination, if Microsoft\nwas prepared to propose a transaction in a range of $90.00-$105.00 per Activision Blizzard share, rather than\nthe $80.00 per share valuation that Mr. Spencer had indicated.\nFollowing that discussion, on November 29, 2021, Mr. Spencer communicated to Messrs. Kotick and Kelly\nthat Microsoft was willing to negotiate a potential transaction within the $90.00-$105.00 per share range,\nalbeit noting that Microsoft would be more comfortable at the lower end of the range. Mr. Spencer also noted\na desire to move quickly in advance of a previously scheduled near-term meeting of Microsoft\u2019s board of\ndirectors at which Mr. Spencer wished to discuss the potential transaction between Microsoft and\nActivision Blizzard. Following this discussion, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly reported the call to Mr. Morgado\nand Mr. Corti as well as to Hendrik Hartong III and Peter Nolan, the remaining members of the Audit\nCommittee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors.\nOn December 1, 2021, Mr. Kotick spoke with Mr. Spencer regarding introductions between the parties\u2019\nrespective legal teams and potential financial advisors, as well as timing of Activision Blizzard\u2019s delivery of\nthe Long-Range Plan (as defined below) following execution of a mutual non-disclosure agreement and\nscheduling of a meeting between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft executives to discuss the Long-Range\nPlan.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with\nmembers of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, Sard Verbinnen\n& Co., Activision Blizzard\u2019s strategic communications firm, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, which\nwe refer to as \u201cWilmerHale,\u201d and Skadden, in attendance for portions of the meeting. At the meeting,\nfollowing the departure of the representatives of Sard Verbinnen & Co., Mr. Morgado provided an update to\nthe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on the discussions with representatives of Microsoft regarding a\npotential acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Following the departure of the representatives of\nAllen & Company, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed the potential formal engagement of\nfinancial advisors to assist Activision Blizzard in connection with a potential transaction with Microsoft and\nother potential alternatives available to Activision Blizzard. After discussing the relevant experience and\nqualifications of various potential financial advisors, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors decided to\nwork with Allen & Company. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors selected Allen & Company on the\nbasis of, among other factors, Allen & Company\u2019s qualifications and reputation, extensive experience in\nadvising software companies in connection with potential strategic transactions (including in which\nMicrosoft was a counterparty), its knowledge and understanding of Activision Blizzard\u2019s business and\nindustry from its previous work with Activision Blizzard, and the absence of any known material conflicts\nwith respect to Microsoft.\nAt the same meeting, a representative of Skadden discussed the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in the context of\nconsidering a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard and various considerations that should be included\nin the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 decision-making process. The Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors, senior management and representatives of Skadden then discussed the potential process the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors might pursue in exploring a potential strategic transaction with\nMicrosoft or other companies potentially interested in and capable of undertaking a strategic transaction\nwith Activision Blizzard, and potential regulatory considerations in connection with any such strategic\ntransaction.\nLater on December 3, 2021, following the conclusion of the meeting of the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors earlier in the day, Messrs. Kotick and Kelly received an unsolicited email from the chief executive\nofficer of another gaming company, which we refer to as \u201cCompany A,\u201d addressed to the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors, expressing interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction with Activision Blizzard,\nbut without any details regarding the terms of such transaction. Subsequently, Mr. Kotick received an\nadditional communication from the chief executive officer of Company A, expressing a desire to meet in\nperson the following week.\nOn December 6, 2021, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement in\norder to facilitate Activision Blizzard sharing with Microsoft certain confidential information,\n33 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nincluding at a meeting to be held the following day. Activision Blizzard is not a party or subject to any non-\ndisclosure or other agreement with a party other than Microsoft, including with Companies A, C, D or E or\nIndividual B (each as defined below), with respect to a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard nor is any\nother party subject to any standstill or \u201cdon\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-waive\u201d provision that would inhibit such party from\nmaking a proposal.\nAlso on December 6, 2021, at the request of Activision Blizzard senior management, in advance of the\nmeeting scheduled for the following day, Activision Blizzard\u2019s long-range plan (which we refer to as the\n\u201cLong-Range Plan\u201d), together with \u201cstretch\u201d goals and objectives of the management teams of Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s franchises and business units included as an appendix (as described below), was shared with\nrepresentatives of Microsoft, and subsequently shared by Microsoft with representatives of Goldman Sachs\n& Co. LLC, Microsoft\u2019s financial advisor, which we refer to as \u201cGoldman Sachs.\u201d The Long-Range Plan was\napproved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on November 2, 2021 as the plan to be used for\ninternal business planning purposes for Activision Blizzard\u2019s performance for its fiscal years 2021 through\n2024.\nAlso on December 6, 2021, Mr. Kelly received an unsolicited email from an individual, who we refer to as\n\u201cIndividual B,\u201d indicating a desire to explore the potential acquisition of the Company\u2019s Blizzard business\nunit or potentially a full (or partial) take-private transaction with unidentified potential co-investors.\nOn December 7, 2021, a meeting was held between representatives of Activision Blizzard, including Messrs.\nKelly and Kotick and Armin Zerza, chief financial officer of Activision Blizzard, together with representatives\nof Allen & Company and Skadden, and representatives of Microsoft, including Mr. Spencer as well as\nindividuals in the corporate development, finance and legal functions within Microsoft, representatives of\nGoldman Sachs and representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, outside legal counsel to Microsoft,\nwhich we refer to as \u201cSimpson.\u201d During the meeting, the representatives of Activision Blizzard discussed\nwith the representatives of Microsoft the Long-Range Plan and long-term opportunities for Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s business. The attendees also discussed various other aspects of Activision Blizzard\u2019s business.\nOn December 8, 2021, Mr. Spencer informed Mr. Kotick that a potential transaction with Activision Blizzard\nwas considered at a meeting of Microsoft\u2019s Board of Directors on December 8, 2021, and that, as authorized\nby Microsoft\u2019s Board of Directors, Activision Blizzard should expect to receive a proposal from Microsoft for\na potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard shortly.\nOn December 10, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with\nmembers of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale\nand Skadden, in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Kelly provided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors on the meeting between representatives of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, the conversation\nbetween Messrs. Kotick and Spencer, and the communications with the chief executive officer of Company A\nand Individual B. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors then discussed timing and structuring,\nregulatory, and process considerations should the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors decide to engage in\nfurther discussions with Microsoft following receipt of a proposal from Microsoft. The Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors also discussed other technology and/or gaming companies that might have interest in\npursuing a transaction with Activision Blizzard, including Company A, as well as Activision Blizzard\ncontinuing on a standalone basis. With respect to such other parties, the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors considered their potential strategic interest, ability to deliver greater value for Activision Blizzard\nstockholders than an all-cash proposal from Microsoft, and potential regulatory hurdles in a transaction with\nsuch parties. With respect to Company A, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed, among other\nthings, that a transaction with Company A would necessarily include a very significant stock component,\nwhich would not be directly comparable to an all-cash transaction, would not likely yield significant cost\nsynergies and would need to be premised on the belief that the long-term value of the combined company\nwould achieve greater value than Activision Blizzard\u2019s stand-alone plan. The Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors also discussed the relative size and trading multiples of Activision Blizzard and Company A and the\nimplications for how a combined company might trade. Allen & Company and Skadden also provided their\nrespective views to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on such considerations. While noting that it\nwas unlikely that a transaction with Company A could be as attractive or competitive as an all-cash proposal\nfrom Microsoft, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors determined that, particularly in light of the\nanticipated proposal from Microsoft, it would make\n34 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nsense for Mr. Kotick to meet with the chief executive officer of Company A and learn the parameters of\nCompany A\u2019s interest in a potential transaction. Accordingly, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\ndirected Mr. Kotick to meet with the chief executive officer of Company A and to report back on the results of\nsuch meeting.\nIn addition, Mr. Kelly reported to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on the email he received from\nIndividual B. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed the ability of Individual B to credibly\npursue a transaction of the size and complexity that such a transaction would entail, as well as the disruption\nthat might ensue were it to become known that Activision Blizzard was exploring strategic alternatives, which\nmight occur if Activision Blizzard engaged in discussions with Individual B in light of prior dealings between\nActivision Blizzard and Individual B. After discussions, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors concluded\nthat Mr. Kelly should not engage with Individual B unless instructed to do so at a later date.\nLater on December 10, 2021, Mr. Spencer requested an additional discussion with Mr. Kotick. Mr. Kotick\nconsulted with Messrs. Kelly and Morgado and with a representative of Skadden about the potential\ntransaction prior to the telephone call with Mr. Spencer.\nLater that afternoon, on a telephone call among Mr. Kotick, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer informed\nMr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly that Microsoft would be sending a written non-binding indication of interest to\nacquire Activision Blizzard later that evening at a purchase price of $90.00 per share in cash. Messrs. Kotick\nand Kelly expressed their disappointment in the proposed price but stated that they would report the\nproposal to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors.\nLater that evening on Friday, December 10, 2021, a representative of Simpson, on behalf of Microsoft, sent to\na representative of Skadden a non-binding indication of interest to acquire Activision Blizzard for $90.00 per\nshare in cash, together with a draft exclusivity agreement providing for exclusive discussions with Microsoft\nthrough January 15, 2022. The letter requested a response to the proposal by Monday, December 13, 2021.\nOn December 12, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with\nmembers of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale\nand Skadden, in attendance. At the meeting, Mr. Morgado outlined the terms of the non-binding indication\nof interest received from Microsoft and described Messrs. Kotick\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s recent conversations with\nMr. Spencer. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed that in addition to the $90.00 per share\ncash purchase price, the indication of interest (i) requested a response by December 13, 2021, (ii) proposed a\nperiod of exclusive negotiation through January 15, 2022 pursuant to the terms of an accompanying\nexclusivity agreement, (iii) stated that the transaction would be all-cash and not subject to any financing\ncondition and (iv) noted that Activision Blizzard, post-acquisition, would be led by the Gaming leadership of\nMicrosoft. Representatives of Allen & Company and Skadden also reported that, in conversations with their\nrespective counterparty advisors to Microsoft, each had conveyed a desire on the part of Microsoft to move\nexpeditiously.\nAt the meeting, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed that, in determining how to respond to\nMicrosoft\u2019s non-binding indication of interest, it would be helpful for the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors to have a sense of other parties that might be interested in pursuing a transaction with Activision\nBlizzard. Allen & Company suggested a number of potential third parties for consideration, including which\nof those third parties, in Allen & Company\u2019s view, would likely be most able to acquire Activision Blizzard in\na transaction that could potentially deliver greater value to stockholders of Activision Blizzard than the non-\nbinding indication of interest received from Microsoft. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed\nthe potential strategic rationale for a transaction with such third parties, including the potential ability of\neach such third party to successfully complete an acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the ability of each such\nthird party to submit an offer to acquire Activision Blizzard for consideration consisting solely of cash,\nequity or a combination of cash and equity, the relative advantages and disadvantages of the form of\nconsideration in a transaction and tactical considerations with respect to conducting an outreach to such\nthird parties. Allen & Company indicated that, in its view, Companies C, D and E (each as defined below)\nwere most likely to be able to acquire Activision Blizzard in a transaction that could potentially deliver\ngreater value to Activision Blizzard\u2019s stockholders than Microsoft\u2019s proposal.\n35 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt the meeting, Mr. Kotick also provided an update on his communications with the chief executive officer of\nCompany A, noting that an upcoming meeting had been scheduled for December 14, 2021, and that he would\nreport back after such meeting.\nAlso at the meeting, a representative of Skadden provided an overview of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties in\nconnection with their evaluation of a potential sale of Activision Blizzard in general and Microsoft\u2019s non-\nbinding indication of interest specifically. In addition, a representative of Skadden discussed with the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors other considerations relating to deal timing and certainty.\nThe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also discussed various considerations involved in soliciting third-\nparty indications of interest in a potential transaction with Activision Blizzard. The Activision Blizzard Board\nof Directors discussed the potential benefits of assessing third parties\u2019 interest, including the potential to\nobtain a higher value for stockholders from a third party and the potential that increased competition could\nresult in an increased purchase price and better overall terms for Activision Blizzard from Microsoft in the\nevent that one or more other parties expressed interest. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also\ndiscussed the significant downside and disruption that could occur from market rumors regarding\nexploratory outreaches, including a potential adverse reaction from Microsoft that could negatively impact\nits willingness to proceed with a transaction with Activision Blizzard. In addition, the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors discussed the most effective approach in the event of such outreach, including who\nspecifically was best positioned to conduct such outreach and attract serious interest. After discussions, the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized and directed Mr. Kotick, along with other members of\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s management and/or advisors as needed, to contact Companies C, D and E (each as\ndefined below) initially, and, in the event of insufficient interest on the part of those three parties, to contact\none other potential strategic counterparty, to gauge interest in a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nAt this meeting and in other meetings throughout the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 consideration\nof the potential transaction with Microsoft, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors met in executive\nsession with only non-employee directors, outside counsel and the Secretary of the meeting in attendance to\nallow the non-employee directors to confer about the matters discussed at the meeting.\nThat same day, as authorized by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors at the earlier meeting, Mr. Kotick\ncontacted the chief executive officer of a potential strategic acquiror, which we refer to as \u201cCompany C.\u201d The\nchief executive officer of Company C stated that Company C was potentially interested in acquiring\nActivision Blizzard. Mr. Kotick subsequently spoke with another senior executive of Company C. The\nfollowing day, at Company C\u2019s request and in accordance with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019\ndirectives, representatives of Allen & Company sent to Company C a draft mutual non-disclosure agreement\nthat had been prepared by Skadden and contained substantially similar terms to those in the non-disclosure\nagreement entered into between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft. As described below, Company C\ndetermined not to proceed with a potential transaction involving Activision Blizzard. Accordingly, the mutual\nnon-disclosure agreement was never negotiated or executed between Activision Blizzard and Company C or\ntheir respective advisors.\nAlso on December 12, 2021, after the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors meeting authorizing the outreach,\nMr. Kotick contacted the chairperson of the board of a potential strategic acquiror, which we refer to as\n\u201cCompany D.\u201d The chairperson of the board of Company D stated that Company D was potentially\ninterested in acquiring Activision Blizzard and that Company D would initially evaluate the viability of a\npotential acquisition of Activision Blizzard internally and revert to Mr. Kotick.\nThe following day, December 13, 2021, Mr. Kotick spoke to the chief executive officer of another potential\nstrategic acquiror, which we refer to as \u201cCompany E,\u201d as authorized by the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors the previous day, regarding Company E\u2019s potential interest in acquiring Activision Blizzard. The\nchief executive officer of Company E indicated an interest in a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard,\nbut expressed concerns regarding the ability to execute a transaction between the parties. The chief\nexecutive officer of Company E stated that Company E would need to further consider internally any\npotential business combination. Mr. Kotick also spoke with another senior executive from Company E later\nthe same day, who indicated that Company E would discuss potential strategic opportunities internally and\nrevert to Mr. Kotick. A few days later, Mr. Kotick spoke with that senior executive of Company E who\n36 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ninformed Mr. Kotick that Company E was not in a position to pursue a full acquisition of Activision Blizzard\nalthough Company E would be interested in considering other potential transactions between the parties.\nBased on the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 direction that Mr. Kotick not reach out to the fourth\nparty if there appeared to be potential interest on the part of Company C, Company D and/or Company E, Mr.\nKotick did not reach out to the fourth party pending further developments with Company C, Company D, and\nCompany E.\nAlso on December 13, 2021, representatives of Allen & Company received an inquiry from a senior executive\nof Company C about a potential transaction with Activision Blizzard. In accordance with the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors\u2019 directives, representatives of Allen & Company followed up with Company C\nand communicated to a Company C representative that for an offer to be attractive to Activision Blizzard, it\nshould be structured as an all-cash acquisition of the entire company and that Company C should be\nprepared to move expeditiously.\nOn December 14, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with\nmembers of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale\nand Skadden, in attendance. Activision Blizzard\u2019s senior management presented to the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors updated financial forecasts regarding Activision Blizzard\u2019s long-term financial\nperformance for Activision Blizzard\u2019s fiscal years 2021 through 2024, which had been downwardly adjusted\nfrom the Long-Range Plan by Activision Blizzard management to account for, among other things, the\npassage of time since the Long-Range Plan was approved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on\nNovember 2, 2021, execution risk in the Long-Range Plan, and further insight into Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nperformance in the fourth quarter of 2021\u202f-\u202fparticularly the underperformance of the recently launched \u201cCall\nof Duty: Vanguard\u201d and the potential effects of that underperformance in 2022. Senior management noted\nthat the updated financial forecasts were not intended to constitute a revised Long-Range Plan, and did not\nreflect any adjustments that Activision Blizzard might make in its strategy in response to Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021. Activision Blizzard\u2019s senior management further noted\nfor the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that, in the ordinary course, Activision Blizzard would assess\nits performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 to refresh Activision Blizzard\u2019s outlook for the entirety of 2022,\nand would not typically refresh the outlook for years beyond 2022 at this stage of Activision Blizzard\u2019s\ntypical financial planning process, although it had done so at this time in order to provide the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors with an updated risk-adjusted view of Activision Blizzard\u2019s potential prospective\nfinancial performance as it considered the potential transaction with Microsoft. The Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors then considered and further discussed these updated risk-adjusted financial forecasts.\nFollowing such discussion, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors approved use of such updated risk-\nadjusted financial forecasts for purposes of considering the potential transaction with Microsoft.\nAt the meeting, Mr. Kotick provided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on his\ncommunications with representatives of Company C, Company D and Company E and representatives of\nAllen & Company provided an update on their communications with Company C. The Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors discussed the need to further ascertain the interest levels of Company C, Company D and\nCompany E in a potential transaction and timing considerations in relation to responding to Microsoft\u2019s non-\nbinding indication of interest in view of Microsoft\u2019s request for a response by December 13, 2021. Also at the\nmeeting, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed certain information provided by Allen &\nCompany regarding Allen & Company\u2019s material relationships with Activision Blizzard and Microsoft during\nthe preceding two-year period as previously provided to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. After\nconsulting with Activision Blizzard\u2019s legal advisors, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors determined\nthat, based on such information, there were no material conflicts that would preclude Allen & Company from\ncontinuing to serve as financial advisor to Activision Blizzard.\nLater on December 14, 2021, Mr. Kotick met with the chief executive officer of Company A. During the\nmeeting, the chief executive officer of Company A expressed that a strategic combination between the\ncompanies would be beneficial for both companies and their stockholders, but did not provide a proposal for\na potential transaction. During the meeting, the chief executive officer of Company A did not communicate\nany requests to, or propose any specific actions from, Activision Blizzard.\n37 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAlso on December 14, 2021, Mr. Spencer spoke with Mr. Kotick to request an update on Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nresponse to Microsoft\u2019s non-binding indication of interest. Following this conversation on December 14,\n2021, in accordance with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 directives, representatives of Allen &\nCompany updated representatives of Goldman Sachs that additional meetings of the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors were planned in advance of Activision Blizzard delivering a response to Microsoft\u2019s non-\nbinding indication of interest.\nOn December 15, 2021, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held a meeting by videoconference, with\nmembers of Activision Blizzard senior management, and representatives of Allen & Company, WilmerHale\nand Skadden, in attendance.

Representatives of Allen & Company\nprovided an update to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on their communications with\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Microsoft\u2019s stated areas of focus in due diligence should the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors authorize continued engagement with Microsoft.\nThe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors discussed a range of potential alternative responses in\nconnection with the non-binding indication of interest received from Microsoft and the relative advantages\nand disadvantages of a combination with Microsoft compared to other potential counterparties, as well as\ncontinuing on a standalone basis, and also considered additional factors, including, among other things, the\neconomic and competitive landscape of the current gaming and technology sectors. After discussions, the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors directed Messrs. Kotick and Kelly and representatives of Allen &\nCompany to convey to Microsoft a request to increase its proposed purchase price from $90.00 per share to\n$100.00 per share. At the same time, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized management to\nproceed with its negotiations with Microsoft, without the need for further Board authorization, in the event\nmanagement was able to increase Microsoft\u2019s proposal to at least $95.00 per share.\nLater that day on December 15, 2021, a senior executive of Company C communicated to representatives of\nAllen & Company that Company C would not be in a position to proceed with discussing a potential\nbusiness combination with Activision Blizzard.\nLater that evening on December 15, 2021, Messrs.

During\nthe call later that morning with Mr. Kotick, Mr. Nadella inquired whether Activision Blizzard would consider a\nproposal below the $100.00 per share amount previously communicated to Microsoft. Mr. Kotick suggested\nto Mr. Nadella that Microsoft should provide its best and final offer and reiterated that Activision Blizzard\nwas focused on taking actions that were in the best interests of its stockholders. Mr. Nadella reiterated\nMicrosoft\u2019s desire to move expeditiously.\nMessrs. Kotick and Nadella had a series of telephone calls over the course of December 16, 2021. Mr. Nadella\ninitially communicated Microsoft\u2019s willingness to increase the price contemplated by Microsoft\u2019s non-\nbinding indication of interest from $90.00 to $93.00 per share on the condition that Activision\n38 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBlizzard grant Microsoft a 30-day exclusivity period. Mr. Kotick informed Mr. Nadella that he was not\nauthorized to proceed at a price below $95.00 per share, but he was authorized to consider a $95.00 per share\nprice with a 30-day exclusivity commitment at that price level and also would need an agreement from\nMicrosoft on certain other key terms, particularly related to a reverse termination fee. Mr. Nadella responded\nthat he would have to discuss further internally. Subsequently, Mr. Nadella proposed to increase the price\nprovided for in Microsoft\u2019s non-binding indication of interest to $95.00 per share and expressed willingness\nto engage in discussions on whether Microsoft would agree to a reverse termination fee and the quantum of\nsuch fee, as well as other transaction terms, at the appropriate time.\nLater in the evening of December 16, 2021, representatives of Skadden sent a markup of the exclusivity\nagreement, which included a term sheet, to representatives of Simpson. Subsequently, representatives of\nSimpson contacted representatives of Skadden to discuss the exclusivity agreement and term sheet.

Mr. Kotick discussed that Activision Blizzard\ncould represent an attractive strategic combination for Company D, but explained that circumstances had\nchanged since he first spoke with Company D\u2019s chairperson and that it now was likely that, very shortly,\nActivision Blizzard would not be in a position to engage in additional discussions for some period of time.\nMr. Kotick also suggested that Company D could readily perform due diligence on Activision Blizzard in the\nmeantime based on publicly available information. The representatives of Company D expressed that\nCompany D was not prepared to proceed expeditiously on the basis of publicly available information and\nimplied that Company D would only be interested in relaying an indication of interest if provided with an\nopportunity to review confidential information. Following this call, no further discussions were held with\nCompany D.\nAlso on December 20, 2021, Messrs.

Also at this\nmeeting, Allen & Company reviewed with the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors its financial analysis of\nthe merger consideration, and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated\nJanuary 17, 2022, to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to the effect that, as of such date and based\non and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications\nand limitations on the review undertaken as set forth in such opinion, the merger consideration to be\nreceived by holders of Activision Blizzard common stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft, Sub\nand their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to\nsuch holders. After discussions, including as to the matters described below under \u201c- Recommendation of\nthe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u037e Activision Blizzard\u2019s Reasons for the Merger,\u201d the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors unanimously determined to delegate the final resolution of the dividend issue to\nan ad hoc committee of directors of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, consisting of Messrs.\nMorgado, Kelly and Corti, and (i) determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Activision Blizzard and its\nstockholders\u037e (ii) declared advisable, approved and authorized in all respects the execution and delivery of\nthe merger agreement by Activision Blizzard, the performance by Activision Blizzard of its obligations\nthereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby upon the terms and conditions\nset forth therein\u037e (iii) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting\nof the stockholders of Activision Blizzard\u037e and (iv) recommended that Activision Blizzard stockholders adopt\nthe merger agreement.\nFollowing the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the\nmerger) by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft finalized the merger\nagreement, including the resolution of the outstanding dividend issue, which Mr. Nadella and Mr. Kotick\ndiscussed during the evening of January 17, 2022, and the resolution of which was approved by the ad hoc\ncommittee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger\nagreement and to recommend that Activision Blizzard stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including, but not limited to the\nfollowing (which are not necessarily presented in order of their relative importance to the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors):\nPremium to Market Price. The fact that the merger consideration of $95.00 per share in cash to be\nreceived by the holders of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock in the merger represents a\nsignificant premium over the market price at which shares of Activision Blizzard common stock traded\nprior to the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, including the fact that the\nmerger consideration represents a premium of:\napproximately 19.8% over the volume-weighted average closing stock price of shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock for the one-year period ended January 14, 2022\u037e\napproximately 45.3% over the closing stock price of Activision Blizzard common stock on\nJanuary 14, 2022, the last trading day prior to the approval of the transaction\u037e and\napproximately 50.3% over the volume-weighted average stock price of shares of Activision\nBlizzard common stock during the 30 trading days ended January 14, 2022.\nForm of Consideration. The fact that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, which provides\nstockholders certainty of value and liquidity for their shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\nwhile eliminating long-term business and execution risks.\nFair Value. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the merger represents fair\nvalue for the shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, taking into account the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors\u2019 familiarity with Activision Blizzard\u2019s current and historical financial condition,\nresults of operations, business, competitive position and prospects, as well as Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nfuture business plan and potential long-term value.\nGrowth Opportunities. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, based on discussions\nbetween Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and Microsoft\u2019s transaction history, that Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s business will be an important focus of Microsoft\u2019s growth strategy, which would create\nprofessional growth opportunities for many of Activision Blizzard\u2019s employees.\nBenefits to Customers. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, based on discussions\nbetween Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio and transaction\n43 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nhistory, that Activision Blizzard\u2019s customers will benefit from Microsoft\u2019s complementary product\nofferings and its greater resources and capabilities to expand the business of Activision Blizzard as\npart of Microsoft.\nIndustry Dynamics. The potential for the merger to enhance the combined company\u2019s ability to\ncompete effectively in the highly competitive market environments in which Activision Blizzard and\nMicrosoft operate by combining Activision Blizzard\u2019s creative DNA and library of premium franchises\nwith Microsoft\u2019s technological and distribution capabilities, including the ability to capitalize on new\ngrowth opportunities and to compete for customers and key employee talent.\nLoss of Opportunity. The possibility that, if the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors declined to\nadopt the merger agreement, there may not be another opportunity for Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nstockholders to receive a comparably priced transaction with a comparable level of closing certainty.\nRisks Inherent in Activision Blizzard\u2019s Business Plan. Activision Blizzard\u2019s short-term and long-term\nfinancial projections and the perceived challenges and risks associated with Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nability to meet such projections, including Activision Blizzard\u2019s past track record of meeting internal,\nlong-term projections, the financial results for Activision Blizzard for the year ended December 31,\n2021 and the implications of Activision Blizzard\u2019s fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021 for\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s outlook for 2022 and subsequent years and the competitive threats facing\nActivision Blizzard, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in the \u201crisk factors\u201d and \u201cforward\nlooking statements\u201d sections of Activision Blizzard\u2019s disclosures filed with the SEC, including the\nfact that Activision Blizzard\u2019s actual financial results in future periods could differ materially and\nadversely from the projected results.\nCompany Knowledge. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 knowledge of, and discussions\nwith Activision Blizzard management regarding, Activision Blizzard\u2019s business, operations, financial\ncondition, earnings, strategy and future prospects, including Activision Blizzard\u2019s opportunities to\ncreate stockholder value in the future on a standalone basis and potential risks in the execution of\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s strategic plan.\nArm\u2019s-Length Negotiations. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors and Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s senior management, in coordination with Activision Blizzard\u2019s legal and financial advisors,\nvigorously negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis with Microsoft with respect to price and other terms\nand conditions of the merger agreement, including obtaining a price increase by Microsoft from its\ninitial indication of interest at $80.00 per share to a price of $95.00 per share as well as the stated\nposition of Microsoft that the agreed price was the highest price per share to which Microsoft was\nwilling to agree.\nDerivative Litigation. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 consideration of the potential value\nto Activision Blizzard (and derivatively to Activision Blizzard stockholders) of pending derivative\nlitigation claims that have been brought against the Activision Blizzard\u2019s officers and directors, and,\neven assuming such litigation claims had material value, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019\ndetermination that the merger consideration of $95.00 per share provided more than adequate value\nfor such litigation claims.\nOther Potential Strategic Alternatives. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 consideration,\nfrom time to time, with the assistance of Activision Blizzard\u2019s senior management and legal and\nfinancial advisors, of the various potential strategic alternatives available to Activision Blizzard,\nincluding remaining an independent public company and continuing to execute on Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s strategic plan and the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 belief that the merger presents\na more favorable opportunity for Activision Blizzard stockholders than the potential value that may\nresult from remaining a standalone public company or pursuing other potential strategic alternatives.\nBoard Review of Transaction. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors met, along with\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s senior management and legal and financial advisors, to evaluate and discuss the\nstructure of the merger and the financial and other terms and conditions of, and other matters related\nto, the merger, multiple times between November 26, 2021, which was the date on which Microsoft\nfirst indicated that it would be willing to discuss an acquisition of Activision Blizzard at $80.00 per\nshare and January 18, 2022, which was the date the merger agreement was signed.\n44 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOther Strategic Parties. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors authorized and\ndirected management to contact three other strategic parties to assess their interest in a potential\nacquisition of Activision Blizzard that were viewed, with input from Activision Blizzard\u2019s senior\nmanagement and legal and financial advisors, as the most likely potential counterparties that could\ntransact at a level that could potentially deliver greater value to Activision Blizzard stockholders than\nthe Microsoft transaction and that could potentially obtain required regulatory approval and that\nnone of the parties contacted by Activision Blizzard\u2019s management determined to proceed with\nsubstantive discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nOpinion of Activision Blizzard\u2019s Financial Advisor. The opinion, dated January 17, 2022, of Allen &\nCompany to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview and as of such date, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft, Sub and their respective affiliates)\npursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to the various\nassumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the\nreview undertaken as set forth in such opinion and is more fully described below in the section\nentitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202fOpinion of Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d beginning on page 52.\nTerms of the Merger Agreement. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the\nprovisions of the merger agreement, including the respective representations, warranties and\ncovenants and termination rights of the parties and termination fees payable by Activision Blizzard,\nare reasonable and customary. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors also believed that the terms\nof the merger agreement include the most favorable terms reasonably attainable from Microsoft.\nConditions to the Consummation of the Merger\u037e Likelihood of Closing. The fact that the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger agreement in light of the conditions in the merger agreement\nto the obligations of Microsoft, including the exceptions to the events that would constitute a\nmaterial adverse effect on Activision Blizzard for purposes of the merger agreement, as well as\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s ability to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger\nagreement, including to cause the merger to be consummated if all of the conditions to Microsoft\u2019s\nobligations to effect the merger closing have been satisfied or waived.\nRegulatory Approvals. The fact that the merger agreement requires that Microsoft use its reasonable\nbest efforts to take certain actions necessary to obtain regulatory clearance and satisfy the regulatory\nconditions, including the fact that Microsoft agreed to accept potential remedies in order to obtain\nregulatory approval, including Microsoft\u2019s commitment to divest or take other actions with respect to\nbusinesses or assets of Activision Blizzard, unless such additional remedies would reasonably be\nexpected to result in a material adverse impact on Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries, taken as a\nwhole, have a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or\nhave more than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Microsoft, and that, if the\nmerger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain antitrust\napprovals, Microsoft will be required to pay a reverse termination fee of $2,000,000,000 if the notice\nregarding the termination of the merger agreement is delivered during the first 12 months post-\nsigning, $2,500,000,000 if the notice regarding the termination of the merger agreement is delivered\nduring months 13 to 15 post-signing, or $3,000,000,000 if the notice regarding the termination of the\nmerger agreement is delivered after month 15 post-signing. For a more complete description of\nMicrosoft\u2019s obligations to obtain required regulatory approvals and the reverse termination fee, see\nthe sections below entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fEfforts to Close the Merger\u201d beginning\non page 88 and \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fReverse Termination Fee\u201d beginning on page 93.\nThe merger agreement also provides an appropriate \u201ctermination date\u201d by which time it is reasonable\nto expect that the regulatory conditions are likely to be satisfied, which is subject to automatic\nextension for certain periods if the regulatory conditions are the only conditions not satisfied or\ncapable of being satisfied at such time. For a more complete description of the termination date, see\nthe section below entitled \u201cTerms of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fTermination of the Merger Agreement\u201d\nbeginning on page 91.\n45 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNo Financing Condition. The fact that Microsoft\u2019s representations contained in the merger\nagreement include a representation that Microsoft has and will have available at the effective time the\nfunds necessary for the payment of the aggregate merger consideration and the fact that the merger is\nnot subject to a financing condition.\nAbility to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. The fact that, while the merger\nagreement prohibits Activision Blizzard from actively soliciting competing bids to acquire it, the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors has rights, under certain circumstances, to engage in\ndiscussions with, and provide information to, third parties submitting unsolicited written takeover\nproposals and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition\nagreement that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors determines to be a superior proposal\u037e\nprovided that Activision Blizzard pays a $2,270,100,000 termination fee. The Activision Blizzard Board\nof Directors further considered that the timing of the merger would provide ample opportunity for\nsuch third parties to submit proposals.\nChange of Recommendation. The fact that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors has the right to\nchange its recommendation that Activision Blizzard stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement\nin response to a superior proposal or certain intervening events, subject to certain conditions, and\nthe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\u2019 view that the termination fee of $2,270,100,000 payable to\nMicrosoft under certain circumstances is customary and reasonable and would not preclude or deter\na willing and financially capable third party from making an acquisition proposal for an alternative\ntransaction.\nTermination Fee. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that the termination fee of\n$2,270,100,000 is reasonable in amount, including in comparison with the range of termination fees in\nproportion to equity value payables in comparable third-party transactions considered by the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors.\nRetention of Key Employees. The belief of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that a retention\nprogram and an enhanced severance plan for certain employees of Activision Blizzard that Activision\nBlizzard would be permitted to implement in connection with the merger would help assure the\ncontinuity of management and other key employees, and increase the likelihood of the successful\noperation of Activision Blizzard during the period prior to closing.\nAppraisal Rights. The availability of appraisal rights with respect to the merger for Activision Blizzard\nstockholders who properly exercise their rights under the DGCL, which would give these\nstockholders the ability to seek and be paid a judicially determined appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of\ntheir shares at the completion of the merger.\nIn the course of its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors also considered a variety of risks, uncertainties and other potentially negative factors, including\nthe following (which are not necessarily presented in order of their relative importance to the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors):\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The fact that Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nstockholders will lose the opportunity to realize additional potential long-term value through\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s successful execution as an independent public company.\nImpact of Announcement on Activision Blizzard. The fact that the announcement and pendency of\nthe merger, or the failure to complete the merger, may result in significant costs to Activision Blizzard\nand cause substantial harm to Activision Blizzard\u2019s relationships with its employees (including\nmaking it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management\nand other personnel) and its customers, partners, providers and suppliers, particularly in the event\nthat the merger is not consummated.\nDiversion of Management Attention. The substantial time and effort of management required to\nconsummate the merger, which could disrupt Activision Blizzard\u2019s business operations and may\ndivert employees\u2019 attention away from Activision Blizzard\u2019s day-to-day operations, and the impact of\nsuch efforts on Activision Blizzard\u2019s business in the event that the merger is not consummated.\n46 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTax Treatment. The fact that the all-cash transaction would be taxable to holders of shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nRegulatory Risks. The possibility that regulatory agencies may delay, object to or challenge the\nmerger or may impose terms and conditions on their approvals that adversely affect the business or\nfinancial results of Activision Blizzard or Microsoft and the fact that Microsoft is not required to\nagree to remedies that would reasonably be expected to (x) result in a material adverse impact on\nActivision Blizzard and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) have a material impact on the benefits\nexpected to be derived from the merger by Microsoft or (z) have more than an immaterial impact on\nany business or product line of Microsoft.\nStockholder Approval. The risk that the holders of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock may\nnot approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the Activision Blizzard special meeting.\nClosing Certainty. The fact that there can be no assurance that, even if approved by the holders of\nshares of Activision Blizzard common stock, the merger will be completed on the anticipated timeline\nor at all.\nPre-Closing Covenants. The restrictions on Activision Blizzard\u2019s conduct of business prior to\ncompletion of the merger contained in the merger agreement, including that Activision Blizzard is\nrequired to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business, subject to specific limitations,\nwhich could delay or prevent Activision Blizzard from pursuing certain business opportunities that\nmay arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations during the pendency of the merger\nwithout Microsoft\u2019s consent, and the impact of such delay or loss of business opportunities on\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s business in the event that the merger is not consummated, including on existing\nbusiness and employee relationships.\nNo Solicitation and Termination Fee. The provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the ability\nof Activision Blizzard to solicit or negotiate alternative transactions and that such provisions and the\npotential requirement to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $2,270,100,000 may deter a potential\nacquirer from proposing an alternative transaction for Activision Blizzard that would provide\nActivision Blizzard stockholders with greater value than the merger.\nPotential Litigation. The potential for litigation relating to the merger and the associated costs,\nburden and inconvenience involved in defending any such proceedings.\nLoss of Key Personnel. The risk that, despite retention efforts prior to consummation of the merger,\nActivision Blizzard may lose personnel and the impact of such losses during the period prior to the\nclosing and also in the event that the merger is not consummated.\nTransaction Costs. The transaction costs and retention costs to be incurred in connection with the\nmerger, regardless of whether the merger is completed.\nTiming of Closing. The amount of time it could take to complete the merger, including that completion\nof the merger depends on factors outside of the control of Activision Blizzard or Microsoft, and the\nrisk that the pendency of the merger for an extended period of time following the announcement of\nthe execution of the merger agreement could have an adverse impact on Activision Blizzard, including\nits customer, supplier and other business relationships and potentially impact the trading price of its\ncommon stock, and the fact that an extended period of time may exacerbate the impact of other risks\nconsidered by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors described herein.\nThe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors considered the factors described above as a whole, including\nthrough engaging in discussions with Activision Blizzard\u2019s senior management and legal and financial\nadvisors. Based on this review and consideration, the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors unanimously\nconcluded that these factors, on balance, supported a determination that the terms of the merger agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Activision\nBlizzard and its stockholders, and to make its recommendation to Activision Blizzard stockholders that they\nvote to adopt the merger agreement.\nIn considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that Activision Blizzard\nstockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, Activision Blizzard stockholders should be\n47 \n",

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\naware that Activision Blizzard\u2019s directors and executive officers may have certain interests in the merger that\nare different from, or in addition to, the interests of Activision Blizzard stockholders generally, including the\ntreatment of equity awards held by such directors and executive officers in the merger. For a description of\nthe interests of our directors and executive officers in the merger, see \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement - The Merger - Interests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision\nBlizzard in the Merger\u201d beginning on page 59. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and\ntook these interests into account when approving the merger agreement and determining that the terms of\nthe merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable, fair to and in the best\ninterests of Activision Blizzard and its stockholders.\nThe foregoing discussion of the information and factors that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\nconsidered is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors\ncollectively reached the conclusion to approve the merger agreement and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, in light of the various factors described above\nand other factors that the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors believed were appropriate. In view of the\ncomplexity and wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, that the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors did not find it useful to, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or\nspecific weights or values to any of the factors it considered in reaching its decision and did not undertake\nto make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular\nfactor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different\nweights to different factors. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature\nand should be read in light of the factors set forth in \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page\n24.\nFinancial Forecasts\nActivision Blizzard does not, as a matter of course, normally publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal\nprojections as to its future performance, revenue, earnings or other results given, among other reasons, the\nuncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates, including the\ndifficulty of predicting general economic and market conditions, other than, from time to time, estimated\nranges of certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current year and certain future\nyears in its regular earnings press releases and other investor materials. However, in connection with the\nproposed merger, Activision Blizzard\u2019s management provided certain unaudited prospective financial\ninformation to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors for purposes of considering and evaluating the\nmerger and the merger agreement and to Activision Blizzard\u2019s financial advisor, Allen & Company. Certain of\nsuch prospective financial information also was shared with Microsoft and its financial advisor in\nconnection with Microsoft\u2019s due diligence review and discussions regarding the merger. Set forth below is a\nsummary of the material unaudited prospective financial information provided by the management of\nActivision Blizzard in connection with the merger. We refer in this proxy statement to such unaudited\nprospective financial information, collectively, as the \u201cprospective financial information.\u201d\nThe prospective financial information was not prepared with a view to public disclosure and is included in\nthis proxy statement only because such information was made available as described above. The prospective\nfinancial information was not prepared with a view to compliance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC\nregarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial\ninformation. The prospective financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is\nthe responsibility of, Activision Blizzard\u2019s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited,\nreviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying\nprospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an\nopinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report\nincorporated by reference in this document relates to Activision Blizzard\u2019s previously issued financial\nstatements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.\nAlthough a summary of the prospective financial information is presented with numerical specificity, the\nprospective financial information reflects numerous forecasts, variables, assumptions and estimates as to\n48 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nfuture events made by management of Activision Blizzard, many of which are difficult to predict and subject\nto significant economic and competitive uncertainties beyond Activision Blizzard\u2019s control, that management\nof Activision Blizzard believed in good faith were reasonable and supportable at the time the prospective\nfinancial information was prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to, and reflecting\nthe best currently available estimates and judgments of, the management of Activision Blizzard at the time.\nHowever, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future\nresults nor construed as financial guidance, given the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such\nforecasts. The prospective financial information is subjective in many respects and, thus, subject to\ninterpretation. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the prospective financial\ninformation not to be achieved include general economic, regulatory, market, financial, competitive, seasonal,\ncyclical and other conditions, trends and developments, industry performance, accuracy of certain\naccounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, the ability to\nattract and retain highly skilled employees, the ability to execute day-to-day operations and other strategic\ninitiatives and other factors described or referenced under the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking\nStatements\u201d beginning on page 24. Because the prospective financial information covers multiple years,\nsuch information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. In addition, the\nprospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the\ndate that it was prepared and does not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that\nthe prospective financial information will or would be realized, and actual results may be materially better or\nworse than those contained in the prospective financial information.\nNone of Activision Blizzard or its directors, officers, affiliates, advisors or other representatives makes any\nrepresentation to readers of this proxy statement, and has not made any such representation to Microsoft,\nconcerning the ultimate performance of Activision Blizzard or the combined company compared to the\nprospective financial information. The inclusion of the prospective financial information in this proxy\nstatement does not constitute an admission or representation by Activision Blizzard or any of its directors,\nofficers, affiliates, advisors or other representatives that the information is material nor has such information\nbeen included to influence your decision on how to vote on any proposal. The prospective financial\ninformation should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other\ninformation regarding Activision Blizzard contained in our public filings with the SEC. Financial measures\nprovided to a board of directors or a financial advisor are excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and, therefore, are not subject to SEC rules regarding disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures,\nwhich would otherwise require, among other information, a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure\nto a GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors or Allen & Company in connection with the merger. Accordingly, a\nreconciliation of the financial measures included in the financial projections is not provided.\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, ACTIVISION\nBLIZZARD DOES NOT INTEND, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY, TO UPDATE OR\nOTHERWISE REVISE THE PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES\nEXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN\nIN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT\nREALIZED AND EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE PROSPECTIVE\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE SHOWN TO BE INAPPROPRIATE.\nLong-Range Plan\nAs part of Activision Blizzard\u2019s ordinary course annual financial planning process, and not in contemplation\nof the merger, the Long-Range Plan for Activision Blizzard\u2019s fiscal years 2021 through 2024 was presented by\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s management to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on October 28, 2021. The\nLong-Range Plan was not prepared or extrapolated for Activision Blizzard\u2019s fiscal years 2025 through 2026. In\nconnection with the Long-Range Plan process (and as is typical in Activision Blizzard\u2019s annual financial\nplanning process), the management teams of various Activision Blizzard franchises and business units\nprovided preliminary inputs regarding estimated financial results of such franchises and business units\nbased on the \u201cstretch\u201d goals and objectives of such franchises\u2019 and\n49 \n(1) \n(2) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbusiness units\u2019 management teams which were aggregated by Activision Blizzard\u2019s management into a\ncompilation of \u201cbottom-up\u201d franchise and business unit inputs. Activision Blizzard\u2019s management then\napplied certain risk assessments and judgments to the franchise and business unit inputs in arriving at the\nLong-Range Plan. The Long-Range Plan, as risk-adjusted by Activision Blizzard\u2019s management, was\napproved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on November 2, 2021 as the plan to be used for\ninternal business planning purposes for Activision Blizzard\u2019s performance for the fiscal years 2021 through\n2024, as described in the section entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f-\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202f\nBackground of the Merger\u201d beginning on page 32. The Long-Range Plan, which included as an appendix the\npre-risk-adjusted franchise and business unit inputs, was provided to Microsoft on December 6, 2021 and\nsubsequently shared by Microsoft with Goldman Sachs.\nThe following table reflects selected metrics (in millions) included in the Long-Range Plan as approved by\nthe Activision Blizzard Board of Directors on November 2, 2021:\nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\nLong-Range Plan\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\nRevenue\n$8,856\n$9,174\n$11,725\n$ 12,405\nOperating Income\n$3,718\n$3,886\n$ 4,849\n$ 5,597\nRevenue excludes the impact of deferrals from Activision Blizzard\u2019s accounting treatment under GAAP\non certain of Activision Blizzard\u2019s online-enabled products. Revenue (in millions) from the franchise and\nbusiness unit inputs before applying Activision Blizzard management\u2019s risk assessments and judgments\nincluded as an appendix to the Long-Range Plan was: 2021E: $8,856\u037e 2022E: $9,546\u037e 2023E: $12,654\u037e\n2024E: $13,394.\nOperating Income was calculated in a manner consistent with EBIT (Pre-SBC) as described below in the\nmanagement forecasts. Operating Income (in millions) from the franchise and business unit inputs\nbefore applying Activision Blizzard management\u2019s risk assessments and judgments included as an\nappendix to the Long-Range Plan was: 2021E: $3,718\u037e 2022E: $4,082\u037e 2023E: $5,596\u037e 2024E: $6,391.\nManagement Forecasts\nAt meetings of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held on December 14, 2021, and December 15, 2021,\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s senior management presented to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors updated\nfinancial forecasts for Activision Blizzard\u2019s long-term financial performance (which we refer to in this proxy\nstatement as the \u201cDecember 2021 management forecasts\u201d), which had been extended for fiscal years 2025 and\n2026 based on potential Activision Blizzard longer-term initiatives and downwardly adjusted from the Long-\nRange Plan for fiscal years 2021 through 2024 by Activision Blizzard\u2019s management to account for, among\nother things, the passage of time since the Long-Range Plan was presented to the Activision Blizzard Board\nof Directors on October 28, 2021 and approved by Activision Blizzard\u2019s Board of Directors on November 2,\n2021, further insight into Activision Blizzard\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021\u202f-\u202fparticularly the\nunderperformance of the recently launched version of Call of Duty and the potential effects of that\nunderperformance in 2022, and execution risk in the Long-Range Plan. The updated management forecasts\nwere intended to provide the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors with an updated and risk-adjusted view\nof Activision Blizzard\u2019s potential prospective financial performance in light of the foregoing as it considered\nthe proposed transaction with Microsoft. The updated management forecasts were not intended to, and do\nnot, constitute a revised Long-Range Plan, and do not reflect any adjustments that Activision Blizzard might\nmake in its strategy in response to Activision Blizzard\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021. The\nDecember 2021 management forecasts were subsequently further updated in mid-January 2022, prior to the\napproval of the merger agreement by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors, to reflect forecasted financial\nresults of Activision Blizzard for the fourth quarter of 2021 and other immaterial adjustments (which we refer\nto in this proxy statement as the \u201cJanuary 2022 forecasts\u201d). On January 14, 2022, the Activision Blizzard\nBoard of Directors directed Allen & Company to use and rely upon the January 2022 forecasts in connection\nwith its opinion and related financial analyses summarized under \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger\nAgreement\u202f-\u202fThe Merger\u202f-",

In connection with this engagement, Activision Blizzard requested that Allen & Company\nrender an opinion to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors regarding the fairness, from a financial point\nof view, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of Activision Blizzard common stock pursuant\nto the merger agreement. On January 17, 2022, at a meeting of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors held\nto evaluate the merger, Allen & Company rendered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a\nwritten opinion dated January 17, 2022, to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors to the effect that, as of\nthat date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and\nqualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in its opinion, the merger consideration to\nbe received by holders of Activision Blizzard common stock (other than, to the extent applicable, Microsoft,\nSub and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,\nto such holders.\nThe full text of Allen & Company\u2019s written opinion, dated January 17, 2022, which describes the assumptions\nmade, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken,\nis attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The\ndescription of Allen & Company\u2019s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full text of Allen & Company\u2019s opinion. Allen & Company\u2019s opinion and advisory services were\nintended for the benefit and use of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection\nwith its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other terms,\naspects or implications of the merger. Allen & Company\u2019s opinion did not constitute a recommendation as to the\ncourse of action that Activision Blizzard (or the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors or any committee thereof)\nshould pursue in connection with the merger or otherwise address the merits of the underlying decision by Activision\nBlizzard to engage in the merger, including in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available\nto Activision Blizzard or which Activision Blizzard might engage in or consider. Allen & Company\u2019s opinion does not\nconstitute advice or a recommendation to any securityholder or other person as to how to vote or act on any matter\nrelating to the merger or otherwise.\nAllen & Company\u2019s opinion reflected and gave effect to Allen & Company\u2019s general familiarity with\nActivision Blizzard and the industry in which Activision Blizzard operates as well as information that Allen &\nCompany received during the course of its assignment, including information provided by the management\nof Activision Blizzard in the course of discussions relating to the merger as more fully described below. In\narriving at its opinion, Allen & Company neither conducted a physical inspection of the properties or\nfacilities of Activision Blizzard or any other entity nor made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the\nassets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of Activision Blizzard or\nany other entity, or conducted any analysis concerning the solvency or fair value of Activision Blizzard or\nany other entity. Allen & Company did not investigate, and expressed no opinion or view regarding, any\nactual or potential litigation, proceedings or claims involving or impacting Activision Blizzard or any other\nentity and Allen & Company assumed, with Activision Blizzard\u2019s consent, that there would be no\ndevelopments with respect to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to its analyses or\nopinion.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company, among other things:\nreviewed the financial terms of a draft, dated January 17, 2022, of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nreviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to Activision\nBlizzard, including public filings of Activision Blizzard, and historical market prices for Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock\u037e\nreviewed certain financial information relating to Activision Blizzard, including certain internal financial\nforecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data relating to Activision Blizzard, provided to or\ndiscussed with Allen & Company by the management of Activision Blizzard\u037e\nheld discussions with the management of Activision Blizzard relating to the operations, financial condition\nand prospects of Activision Blizzard\u037e\n52 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nreviewed and analyzed certain publicly available information, including certain stock market data and\nfinancial information, relating to selected companies with businesses that Allen & Company deemed\ngenerally relevant in evaluating Activision Blizzard\u037e\nreviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial information relating to selected transactions that\nAllen & Company deemed generally relevant in evaluating the merger\u037e and\nconducted such other financial analyses and investigations as Allen & Company deemed necessary or\nappropriate for purposes of its opinion.\nIn rendering its opinion, Allen & Company relied upon and assumed, with Activision Blizzard\u2019s consent and\nwithout independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax,\naccounting and other information available to Allen & Company from public sources, provided to or\ndiscussed with Allen & Company by the management and other representatives of Activision Blizzard or\notherwise reviewed by Allen & Company. With respect to the financial forecasts, estimates and other\nfinancial and operating data relating to Activision Blizzard that Allen & Company was directed to utilize for\npurposes of its analyses and opinion, Allen & Company was advised by the management of Activision\nBlizzard and Allen & Company assumed, at Activision Blizzard\u2019s direction, that such financial forecasts,\nestimates and other financial and operating data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting\nthe best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to, and were a reasonable basis\nupon which to evaluate, the future financial and operating performance of Activision Blizzard and the other\nmatters covered thereby. Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any financial forecasts,\nestimates or other financial or operating data or the assumptions on which they were based.\nAllen & Company relied, at Activision Blizzard\u2019s direction, upon the assessments of the management of\nActivision Blizzard as to, among other things, (i) the potential impact on Activision Blizzard of certain market,\ncompetitive, macroeconomic, seasonal, cyclical and other conditions, trends and developments in and\nprospects for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative policies and matters relating to or otherwise\naffecting, the interactive entertainment industry, (ii) existing and new products, franchises and related\nintellectual property and other technology of Activision Blizzard (including associated risks), (iii) workforce\nmatters and related litigation, investigations, consent decrees and other proceedings, including the potential\nimpact thereof on Activision Blizzard, (iv) implications for Activision Blizzard and its operations of the global\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and (v) existing and future agreements and arrangements involving, and the ability to\nattract, retain and/or replace, key employees and contractors, customers, third-party developers,\nmanufacturers, distributors and other commercial relationships of Activision Blizzard. With Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s consent, Allen & Company assumed that there would be no developments with respect to any\nsuch matters that would have an adverse effect on Activision Blizzard or the merger or that otherwise would\nbe meaningful in any respect to its analyses or opinion.\nFurther, Allen & Company\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other\nconditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Allen & Company as of, the date of its\nopinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion expressed in\nAllen & Company\u2019s opinion and that Allen & Company assumed no responsibility for advising any person\nof any change in any matter affecting Allen & Company\u2019s opinion or for updating or revising its opinion\nbased on circumstances or events occurring after the date of such opinion. As the Activision Blizzard Board\nof Directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, the industry in which Activision Blizzard\noperates and the securities of Activision Blizzard have experienced and may continue to experience volatility\nand Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on\nActivision Blizzard or the merger.\nAllen & Company assumed, with Activision Blizzard\u2019s consent, that the merger would be consummated in\naccordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements,\nwithout waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement, and that, in the\ncourse of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, releases,\nwaivers, decrees and agreements for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any\ndivestiture or other requirements or remedies, amendments or modifications, would be imposed or occur that\nwould have an adverse effect on Activision Blizzard or the merger or that otherwise would be meaningful in\nany respect to Allen & Company\u2019s analyses or opinion. In addition, Allen & Company assumed, with\n53 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s consent, that the final executed merger agreement would not differ from the draft\nreviewed by Allen & Company in any respect meaningful to its analyses or opinion.\nAllen & Company\u2019s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of\nsuch opinion, of the merger consideration (to the extent expressly specified in such opinion), without regard\nto individual circumstances of specific holders of Activision Blizzard common stock (whether by virtue of\ncontrol, voting, liquidity, contractual arrangements or otherwise) that may distinguish such holders or the\nsecurities of Activision Blizzard held by such holders, and Allen & Company\u2019s opinion did not in any way\naddress proportionate allocation or relative fairness. Allen & Company\u2019s opinion also did not address any\nother terms, aspects or implications of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the\nmerger, any repurchase, payoff or similar transaction, cloud-related agreements or arrangements or any other\nagreements, arrangements or understandings entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by\nthe merger or otherwise. Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to the fairness, financial or\notherwise, of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation or other consideration payable to\nany officers, directors or employees of any party to the merger or any related entities, or any class of such\npersons or any other party, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Allen & Company did not\nexpress any opinion or view as to the prices at which Activision Blizzard common stock or any other\nsecurities of Activision Blizzard may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including following\nannouncement or consummation of the merger. In addition, Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view\nwith respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters, including, without limitation, as to tax or\nother consequences of the merger or otherwise or changes in, or the impact of, accounting standards, tax\nand other laws, regulations and governmental and legislative policies affecting Activision Blizzard or the\nmerger, and Allen & Company relied, at Activision Blizzard\u2019s direction, upon the assessments of\nrepresentatives of Activision Blizzard as to such matters. Allen & Company\u2019s opinion did not constitute a\nrecommendation as to the course of action that Activision Blizzard (or the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors or any committee thereof) should pursue in connection with the merger or otherwise address the\nmerits of the underlying decision by Activision Blizzard to engage in the merger, including in comparison to\nother strategies or transactions that might be available to Activision Blizzard or which Activision Blizzard\nmight engage in or consider.\nIn connection with its opinion, Allen & Company performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses,\nincluding those described below. The summary of the analyses below and certain factors considered is not a\ncomprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by Allen & Company. The\npreparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various determinations as to the\nmost appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the\nparticular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion and analyses are not readily susceptible to\nsummary description. Allen & Company arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken\nand assessed as a whole, and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or\nmethod of analysis. Accordingly, Allen & Company believes that the analyses and factors summarized below\nmust be considered as a whole and in context. Allen & Company further believes that selecting portions of\nthe analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all\nanalyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or\nincomplete view of the processes underlying Allen & Company\u2019s analyses and opinion.\nIn performing its financial analyses, Allen & Company considered industry performance, general business\nand economic, market and financial conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many\nof which are beyond the control of Activision Blizzard. No company, business or transaction reviewed is\nidentical or directly comparable to Activision Blizzard, its businesses or the merger and an evaluation of\nthese analyses is not entirely mathematical\u037e rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and\njudgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public\ntrading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed. The assumptions\nand estimates of the future performance of Activision Blizzard in or underlying Allen & Company\u2019s analyses\nand the implied reference ranges derived from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual\nvalues or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or\nthose suggested by such analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of Allen & Company\u2019s\nanalysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration and were provided to the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors in connection with the delivery of Allen &\n54 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCompany\u2019s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company\nmight actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future.\nAccordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the reference ranges resulting from, any particular\nanalysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as the\nviews of Allen & Company regarding the actual value of Activision Blizzard.\nAllen & Company did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate\nconsideration in the merger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined\nthrough negotiations between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, rather than by any financial advisor, and\napproved by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was\nsolely that of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. Allen & Company\u2019s opinion and analyses were only\none of many factors considered by the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors in its evaluation of the merger\nand the merger consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors or management with respect to the merger or the consideration payable in the\nmerger.\nFinancial Analyses\nThe summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled \u201c- Financial Analyses\u201d is a summary\nof the material financial analyses provided by Allen & Company in connection with its opinion, dated\nJanuary 17, 2022, to the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors. The summary set forth below is not a\ncomprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Allen & Company in connection with its opinion, nor does\nthe order of the analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other\nanalysis. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully\nunderstand the financial analyses performed by Allen & Company, the tables must be read together with the text of\neach summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Allen\n& Company. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the\nfinancial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Allen & Company. Future results may differ from those\ndescribed and such differences may be material. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, (i) the\nterm \u201cActivision Blizzard forecasts\u201d refers in this section to the internal financial forecasts, estimates and\nother financial and operating data relating to Activision Blizzard prepared by the management of Activision\nBlizzard as reflected in the January 2022 forecasts, and (ii) the term \u201cEBITDA\u201d means earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain one-time non-\nrecurring items, as applicable (referenced in the January 2022 forecasts as \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nSelected Public Companies Analysis. Allen & Company reviewed certain publicly available financial and\nstock market information relating to Activision Blizzard and the following three selected publicly traded\ncompanies with operations in the interactive entertainment industry that Allen & Company considered\ngenerally relevant for purposes of analysis, collectively referred to as the \u201cselected companies:\u201d\nTake-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\nElectronic Arts Inc.\nUbisoft Entertainment SA\nAllen & Company reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values\nbased on closing stock prices on January 14, 2022, which is the last unaffected trading day prior to public\nannouncement of the merger (except in the case of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., which was based on\nits unaffected closing stock price on January 7, 2022, prior to the announcement of its pending acquisition of\nZynga Inc.) plus total debt and non-controlling interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents\nand unconsolidated assets, as applicable, as a multiple of calendar years 2022 and 2023 estimated EBITDA.\nFinancial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019\nestimates, public filings and other publicly available information.

Financial data for the selected transactions were based on publicly available Wall Street\nresearch analysts\u2019 estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of\nActivision Blizzard was based on the Activision Blizzard forecasts, public filings and other publicly available\ninformation.\nThe overall low to high latest 12 months EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 5.6x\nto 29.9x.

Allen & Company observed certain additional information that was not\nconsidered as part of its financial analyses for its opinion but was noted for informational reference only,\nincluding the following:\nhistorical trading prices of Activision Blizzard common stock during the 52-week period ended\nJanuary 14, 2022, which indicated low to high intraday prices for Activision Blizzard common stock\nduring such period of approximately $56.40 to $104.53 per share\u037e and\npublicly available Wall Street research analysts\u2019 forward stock price targets for Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock, which indicated an overall low to high target price range for Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock of $54.00 to $125.00 per share (with a mean of $90.52 per share and a median of $90.00\nper share).\nMiscellaneous\nActivision Blizzard selected Allen & Company as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based\non, among other things, Allen & Company\u2019s reputation, experience and familiarity with Activision Blizzard\nand the industry in which Activision Blizzard operates. Allen & Company, as part of its investment banking\nbusiness, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers\nand acquisitions, private placements and related financings, negotiated underwritings, secondary\ndistributions of listed and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. As the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware, although during the two-year period prior to the date of its\nopinion Allen & Company did not provide investment banking services to Activision Blizzard unrelated to\nthe merger or to Microsoft for which Allen & Company received compensation, Allen & Company in the\nfuture may provide such services to Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and/or their respective affiliates, for\nwhich Allen & Company would expect to receive compensation. In the ordinary course, Allen & Company as\na broker-dealer and certain of its affiliates, directors and officers have invested or may invest, hold long or\nshort positions and may trade, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, for their own or\nbeneficiaries\u2019 accounts or for those of Allen & Company\u2019s clients, in the debt and equity securities (or\nrelated derivative securities) of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and/or their respective affiliates. The issuance\nof Allen & Company\u2019s opinion was approved by Allen & Company\u2019s opinion committee.\nFor Allen & Company\u2019s financial advisory services, Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay Allen & Company\nan aggregate cash fee of $65 million, of which $10 million was payable upon delivery of Allen & Company\u2019s\nopinion and $55 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. Activision Blizzard also has\nagreed to reimburse Allen & Company\u2019s reasonable expenses and to indemnify Allen & Company and related\nparties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its\nengagement.\nTreatment of Equity Compensation\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, we have granted equity awards with respect to Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock in the form of stock options and stock units (i.e., RSUs and PSUs). Our executive officers hold\noptions, RSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock based on\nservice over a time-based vesting schedule, and PSUs, which represent a right to receive shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock ranging from 0 to 125% (and, in some cases, up to 250%) of the target\n57 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nnumber of shares based on both service over a time-based vesting schedule and achievement of specified\nperformance goals over a specified performance period. Our non-employee directors hold options and RSUs,\nwhich represent a right to receive shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, subject to vesting\nrequirements of the underlying equity award, on a specified future date or event, such as a separation from\nservice. The merger agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to outstanding equity\nawards:\nStock Options\nEach outstanding option to purchase Activision Blizzard common stock granted pursuant to our\nequity incentive plans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, or (ii) will become\nvested by its terms at the effective time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the\nmerger consideration for each share of Activision Blizzard common stock that would have been\nissuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the effective time, less the applicable\noption exercise price for each such share of Activision Blizzard common stock underlying such option\nand any applicable withholding taxes.\nEach option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, and is not cancelled and\nconverted as described above, and has an exercise price per share of Activision Blizzard common\nstock that is less than the merger consideration, will be, as of the effective time and as determined by\nMicrosoft, (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a nonqualified stock option or (y) converted\ninto a nonqualified stock option granted pursuant to Microsoft\u2019s equity incentive plans, in either\ncase, in respect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\nsubject to such assumed option as of immediately prior to the effective time (determined based on\ntarget performance levels, as applicable) multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the\nmerger consideration and (B) the denominator of which is Microsoft\u2019s stock price (i.e., the volume\nweighted average price per share rounded to four decimal places (with amounts of 0.00005 and above\nrounded up) of common stock of Microsoft on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending\nwith the last trading day ending immediately prior to the closing date) (which we refer to as the\n\u201cexchange ratio\u201d), at an exercise price per share of common stock of Microsoft equal to (i) the exercise\nprice of such option divided by (ii) the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)\nrounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. In each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this\nparagraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting and exercisability will remain the same with\nrespect to Activision Blizzard options subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to Activision\nBlizzard options subject to performance-based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting\noptions (determined based on target performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the\noriginal performance period.\nIn the event that the exercise price per share under any option is equal to or greater than the merger\nconsideration, such option will be cancelled as of the effective time without payment therefor and will\nhave no further force or effect.\nStock Units\nEach outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs granted pursuant to Activision Blizzard\u2019s equity incentive\nplans that (i) is vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) will become vested by its terms\nat the effective time or (iii) is granted to a non-employee member of the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors, will, as of the effective time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger\nconsideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to such award,\nless any applicable withholding taxes.\nEach outstanding award of RSUs or PSUs that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective\ntime and is not cancelled and converted as described above, will, as of the effective time, be, as\ndetermined by Microsoft (x) assumed by Microsoft and converted into a stock-based award or (y)\nconverted into a stock-based award pursuant to Microsoft\u2019s equity incentive plans, in either case, in\nrespect of a number of shares of common stock of Microsoft equal to the product (rounded down to\nthe nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock\n58 \n",

In each case of clauses (x) and (y)\nof this paragraph, the terms and conditions relating to vesting will remain the same with respect to\nequity awards subject to time-based vesting, and with respect to equity awards subject to\nperformance-based vesting will be converted into time-based vesting equity awards (determined\nbased on target performance levels) that will vest at the conclusion of the original performance\nperiod.\nNotwithstanding the treatment of outstanding unvested options, RSUs and PSUs described above, prior to\nthe closing date, Microsoft may elect to treat some or all of the awards that would otherwise be converted as\nset forth herein as if they were vested (i.e., by cancelling and converting an award into the right to receive\nthe merger consideration with respect to each share of Activision Blizzard common stock subject to the\naward (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of options), less any applicable withholding taxes\u037e\nprovided that for options, such election may apply only to those options that are otherwise scheduled to\nvest within 120 days following the closing date).\nIf the treatment described above of an award of stock units or options held by a non-U.S. employee would be\nprohibited or subject to onerous regulatory requirements or adverse tax treatment under the laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction (in each case, as reasonably determined by Microsoft), Microsoft will provide\ncompensation to the employee that is equivalent in value to the value that otherwise would have been\nprovided to the employee under the treatment described above, to the extent practicable and as would not\nresult in the imposition of additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code. This compensation will be\nprovided in the form of a cash payment (less applicable taxes) or a new equity award, as reasonably\ndetermined by Microsoft.\nInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the Merger\nWhen considering the recommendation of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors that you vote to\napprove the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our non-employee directors\nand executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your\ninterests as a stockholder. The Activision Blizzard Board of Directors was aware of and considered these\ninterests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing\nthe negotiation of the merger agreement, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and in\nrecommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Activision Blizzard.\nAccelerated Vesting of Equity Compensation Upon Certain Terminations\nNone of the Activision Blizzard outstanding equity awards provide for \u201csingle trigger\u201d vesting immediately\nat the effective time (i.e., as a result of the merger without a termination of employment). However, under the\nterms of the merger agreement, outstanding RSUs held by non-employee directors at the time of the closing\nof the merger will vest in full and the holder will receive the consideration described above under the section\nentitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement  -  The Merger -  Treatment of Equity\nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 57.\nMicrosoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee of the\nActivision Blizzard Board of Directors (which we refer to as the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) has approved,\nthat options, RSUs and PSUs that were granted prior to the date of the merger agreement and certain awards\ngranted after the date of the merger agreement that will be outstanding as of closing, as further detailed\nbelow, that are converted at the effective time of the merger to Microsoft unvested options and unvested\nRSUs pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (such conversion is described above under \u201cTreatment\nof Equity Compensation\u201d), will vest in full on a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d basis (i.e., upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment after a specified period following the effective time of the merger), as follows:\nAny such award that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement, including to our\nexecutive officers, and certain awards granted after the date of the merger agreement that will be\noutstanding as of closing, will vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the\neffective time, the employee\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their\nrespective subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d or by the employee for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where \u201ccause\u201d is\ndefined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined\n59 \u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nbelow) and provided that such acceleration will not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in\nan arrangement already entered into with such employee.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the merger agreement (as modified by the confidential disclosure letter to\nthe merger agreement), Activision Blizzard and Microsoft agreed that certain of our employees,\nincluding executive officers Grant Dixton, Brian Bulatao and Armin Zerza, will be entitled to terminate\ntheir employment within 60 days following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, which will\nbe deemed a termination by the executive for \u201cgood reason,\u201d entitling the executive officer to the\nequity acceleration benefits described directly above and the severance benefits under their\nindividual arrangements or, if greater, the enhanced severance plan, each as described below.\nManagement RSUs\nMicrosoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may grant, and the Compensation Committee has approved the\ngrant of up to $50 million in the aggregate of, RSUs to certain members of senior management, including our\nexecutive officers (but excluding the Chief Executive Officer), which we refer to as \u201cmanagement RSUs.\u201d No\nmanagement RSUs have yet been granted as of the date of this proxy statement. To the extent granted,\nmanagement RSUs would vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the effective time,\nthe employee\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or by the employee for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where \u201ccause\u201d is defined in the confidential\ndisclosure letter to the merger agreement and \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined below) and provided that such\nacceleration would not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in an arrangement already entered into\nwith such employee.\nRetention RSUs\nMicrosoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may grant RSUs up to a certain aggregate grant date value, and\nthe Compensation Committee has approved that grants of RSUs may be made, to certain employees (but\nexcluding any individual who receives a grant of management RSUs) for retention purposes and to\nincentivize employees to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (which we\nrefer to as \u201cretention RSUs\u201d). No retention RSUs have yet been granted as of the date of this proxy\nstatement. To the extent granted, retention RSUs would vest in full if, during the 18-month period\nimmediately following the effective time, the employee\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision\nBlizzard or their respective subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d or by the employee for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where\n\u201ccause\u201d is defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined\nbelow) and provided that such acceleration would not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in an\narrangement already entered into with such employee.\nEmployee RSUs\nPrior to the effective time, Activision Blizzard may grant RSUs, up to a certain aggregate grant date value, to\nemployees other than the Chief Executive Officer in the ordinary course of business consistent with past\npractice of the applicable business unit or functional business unit (which we refer to as \u201cemployee RSUs\u201d).\nNo employee RSUs have yet been granted as of the date of this proxy statement. To the extent employee\nRSUs are granted, certain of the employee RSUs that are granted to certain new employees hired before\nSeptember 1, 2022, would vest in full if, during the 18-month period immediately following the effective time,\nthe employee\u2019s employment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or by the employee for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where \u201ccause\u201d is defined in the confidential\ndisclosure letter to the merger agreement and \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined below) and provided that such\nacceleration would not modify any more favorable acceleration terms in an arrangement already entered into\nwith such employee.\n\u201cGood Reason\u201d means, subject to certain notice and cure periods, in each case without the prior written\nconsent of the holder: (A) solely for those holders who are eligible for the enhanced severance plan, a\nmaterial diminution in authorities, duties and responsibilities, as measured in the aggregate, as compared to\nthose prior to the effective time (provided, that the following will not constitute \u201cgood reason\u201d: (1) the\nholder\u2019s continued employment with substantially the same responsibility with respect to Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s business and operations (e.g., the holder\u2019s title is revised to reflect the holder\u2019s placement within\n60 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe overall corporate hierarchy or the holder provides services to a subsidiary, business unit or otherwise) or\n(2) changes resulting solely from Activision Blizzard ceasing to be a stand-alone public corporation)\u037e (B) a\nmaterial diminution in base salary as in effect immediately prior to the effective time\u037e or (C) a relocation of\nprimary office location by more than 50 miles (provided, that requiring the holder to return to work in the\nholder\u2019s primary office location after working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic or continuing to work\nremotely rather than a primary office location shall not constitute a relocation).\nArrangements with Mr. Kotick\nActivision Blizzard previously announced on October 28, 2021 Mr. Kotick\u2019s intent that his base salary would\nbe reduced to California\u2019s minimum annual salary (which is approximately $62,500 for 2022) and that he not\nbe awarded any bonuses or equity grants until the Workplace Responsibility Committee of the Activision\nBlizzard Board of Directors has determined that Activision Blizzard has made appropriate progress toward\nachievement of the transformational gender-related goals and other commitments described in such\nannouncement.\nIn connection with the merger, Activision Blizzard and Microsoft agreed that if the Workplace\nResponsibility Committee of the Activision Blizzard Board of Directors concludes and reports\npublicly that Activision Blizzard has made appropriate progress toward the achievement of the\ntransformational gender-related goals and other commitments described in Activision Blizzard\u2019s press\nrelease on October 28, 2021 (e.g., launching new zero-tolerance harassment policy, increasing the\npercentage of women and non-binary people in Activision Blizzard\u2019s workforce by 50%, investing\n$250,000,000 to accelerate opportunities for diverse talent, waiving arbitration of individual sexual\nharassment claims and increasing visibility on pay equity), then the Activision Blizzard Board of\nDirectors may, no earlier than six months after the date of the merger agreement, in its discretion:\ngrant an annual equity award to Mr. Kotick as set forth in his employment agreement (as may be\nextended)\u037e provided, that any such award may be granted solely in the form of time-based\nrestricted stock units and will have a grant value on the date of grant equal to no greater than\nthe lesser of (x) the 50th percentile of Activision Blizzard\u2019s then applicable group of peer\ncompanies\u2019 chief executive officer long-term incentive grants and (y) $22,000,000\u037e and/or\nprovide cash compensation to Mr. Kotick under the existing terms of his employment agreement\n(as may be extended) and without regard to any waiver of compensation by Mr. Kotick\u037e\nprovided, that (x) his annualized base salary will not exceed $875,000 and (y) his target annual\ncash bonus would not exceed 200% of his base salary (pro-rated). Any salary increase would be\nprospective following the Workplace Responsibility Committee\u2019s conclusion and will not be\nretroactively applied and any bonus in respect of the calendar year in which the compensation is\nreinstated will be based on 200% of such increased base salary and prorated in respect of the\nperiod following the Workplace Responsibility Committee\u2019s conclusion.\nValue of Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers\nThe estimated aggregate amount of the merger consideration payable with respect to shares of Activision\nBlizzard common stock, including vested stock options, held by our non-employee directors and executive\nofficers, as a group (inclusive of such persons who have served at any time since the beginning of 2021),\nassuming the merger closed on March 8, 2022, is approximately $707 million.\nThe estimated aggregate value of unvested equity awards held by our non-employee directors and executive\nofficers, including our named executive officers and including such persons who have served at any time\nsince the beginning of 2021, that would accelerate in connection with the merger, assuming the merger closed\non March 8, 2022, and, immediately thereafter, the executive officer\u2019s employment was terminated by\nMicrosoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries without \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive officer for\n\u201cgood reason\u201d  (where \u201ccause\u201d is defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and\n\u201cgood reason\u201d is defined above) is approximately $1 million for our non-employee directors, and\napproximately $56 million for our executive officers. These values do not include any new Activision Blizzard\nequity awards that may be granted after the date of this proxy statement. These values are calculated by\nmultiplying the number of shares underlying awards by the per share merger consideration (assuming\n61 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ntarget performance for PSUs and performance options), less the exercise price for options.

In the case of each of our executive officers other than Mr. Kotick, the\nseverance benefits under the enhanced severance plan described below will be greater than the benefits that\nthey would receive under their respective employment agreements.\nMr. Kotick\u2019s executive employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by\nActivision Blizzard without \u201ccause\u201d or if he resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (as each such terms are\ndefined in his agreement), in either case within 12 months after a change of control (which will occur\nat the effective time),

favor of Activision Blizzard and its\naffiliates and to continue to comply with certain post-termination covenants in favor of Activision Blizzard\nand its affiliates.\n280G Mitigation Actions\nThe employment agreements of Messrs. Kotick, Zerza, Alegre, Dixton and Bulatao provide for a \u201cbest net\u201d\napproach such that if the payment of any amounts to the executive would subject the executive to the excise\ntax provisions of Section 280G of the Code, the payments would be reduced to an amount below the\nthreshold at which such penalty tax provisions apply if such a reduction (and the avoidance of such penalty\ntaxes) would be more favorable to the executive on an after-tax basis. While Activision Blizzard may be\npermitted to take certain actions to reduce the amount of any potential \u201cexcess parachute payments\u201d for\n\u201cdisqualified individuals\u201d  (each as defined in Section 280G of the Code), the Compensation Committee has\nnot yet approved any specific actions to mitigate the anticipated impact of Section 280G of the Code on\nActivision Blizzard and any disqualified individuals. Executives are not entitled to receive gross-ups or tax\nreimbursements from Activision Blizzard with respect to any potential excise taxes.\nEnhanced Severance Plan\nMicrosoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee has approved\nthe key terms of, an enhanced severance plan, which provides that a limited number of covered\n64 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nemployees, including our executive officers, would be entitled to the following benefits in the event their\nemployment is terminated by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or by the executive for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where \u201ccause\u201d is defined in the confidential\ndisclosure letter to the merger agreement and \u201cgood reason\u201d is defined above), in either case, within 18\nmonths following the effective time (subject to the executive\u2019s execution of Activision Blizzard\u2019s customary\nrelease of claims): (i) the greater of (A) either one or two times (depending on level) the sum of the\nexecutive\u2019s base salary and target annual cash incentive bonus (excluding any milestone or special bonus\npayments) and (B) the severance payable under the executive\u2019s employment agreement\u037e (ii) a pro-rated target\nannual cash incentive bonus payment based on the percentage of the year completed as of the termination\ndate\u037e and (iii) reimbursement of COBRA premiums for a certain period. In the case of each of our executive\nofficers (other than Mr. Kotick), the severance benefits under the enhanced severance plan will be greater\nthan the benefits that they would receive under their respective employment agreements.\nThe estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance benefits our executive officers, including our named\nexecutive officers, would have received upon a qualifying termination of employment under the enhanced\nseverance plan, assuming the merger closed on March 8, 2022, and a qualifying termination of employment\noccurred immediately thereafter, is approximately $31 million. For estimates of the amounts of such cash\nseverance that each of our named executive officers would have received under the enhanced severance plan\nindividually, see the section below entitled \u201cProposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement\u202f\u202f-\u202f\u202fThe Merger\u202f-\u202f\nInterests of the Non-Employee Directors and Executive Officers of Activision Blizzard in the\nMerger\u202f-\u202f\u201cGolden Parachute Compensation\u201d beginning on page 65.\nOmnibus Severance Plan\nMicrosoft has agreed that Activision Blizzard may approve, and the Compensation Committee has approved\nthe key terms of, an omnibus severance plan, which include that employees of Activision Blizzard as of the\neffective time (other than those covered under the enhanced severance plan) would be entitled to the\nfollowing benefits in the event their employment is terminated by Activision Blizzard or its affiliates\n(including Microsoft) other than for cause within 12 months following the effective time (subject to the\napplicable employee\u2019s execution of Activision Blizzard\u2019s customary release of claims): (i) the greater of (A)\nup to 52 weeks\u2019 salary, plus 60 days\u2019 pay, for covered individuals in positions of vice president and above\n(or, for individuals in positions of senior director and below up to 26 weeks\u2019 salary, plus 60 days\u2019 pay), and\n(B) the severance payable under any other agreement with the employee, if any\u037e (ii) a pro-rated target annual\ncash incentive bonus based on the percentage of the year completed as of the termination date\u037e and (iii)\nreimbursement of one year of COBRA premiums.\nOther Arrangements with Microsoft\nExcept as otherwise set forth herein, as of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has\nentered into any agreement with Microsoft regarding employment with, or compensation to be received from,\nthe surviving corporation or Microsoft on a going-forward basis following the closing of the merger and\nthere have been no discussions of any such arrangements between Microsoft and any of our executive\nofficers.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the estimated amounts of the\npayments and benefits that each named executive officer of Activision Blizzard would have received in\nconnection with the merger, assuming the merger closed on March 8, 2022 and, immediately thereafter, the\nemployment of the named executive officer was terminated by Activision Blizzard or its affiliates (including\nMicrosoft) without \u201ccause\u201d or the named executive officer resigned for \u201cgood reason\u201d  (where, for Mr.\nKotick, each such term has the meaning set forth in his employment agreement with Activision Blizzard and,\nfor the other executives, \u201ccause\u201d is defined in the confidential disclosure letter to the merger agreement and\n\u201cgood reason\u201d is defined above). This compensation is subject to an advisory vote of Activision Blizzard\u2019s\nstockholders, as described below under the section entitled \u201cProposal 2: Advisory Vote on Merger-Related\nExecutive Compensation Arrangements\u201d beginning on page 95.\n65 \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nThe calculations in the tables below do not include any new Activision Blizzard equity awards or other\ncompensation increases that may be granted to the named executive officers before the effective time,\nincluding management RSUs. In addition to the assumptions regarding the closing date of the merger and\ntermination of the employment of the named executive officers, these estimates are based on certain other\nassumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the tables below. In addition to the named\nexecutive officers set forth in the table below, Chris Walther, Dennis Durkin and Claudine Naughton also\neach served as a named executive officer during fiscal year 2021\u037e however, these individuals would not\nbecome entitled to any accelerated payment, vesting or benefits or other compensation as a result of the\nclosing of the merger. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in\nconnection with the merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.\nOfficer\nCash \n($)\nEquity \n($)\nPerquisites/\u200b\nBenefits\n($)\nTotal \n($)\nRobert A.

Walther and Durkin and Ms. Naughton also each served as named executive officers during\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s last fiscal year and these former executive officers are not entitled to any amounts\nin connection with any compensation arrangement as a result of or in connection with the merger.\nCash. The amounts in this column reflect the value of the cash severance payments payable to each\nnamed executive officer, including a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination. For Mr. Kotick,\nthe amount in this column represents severance and, pursuant to his employment agreement with\nActivision Blizzard, is equal to three times the sum of his current annual base salary and his 2016 target\nbonus. For Messrs. Zerza, Alegre, Bulatao and Dixton, the amounts in this column represent severance\nand a prorated annual bonus payable under the enhanced severance plan. The breakdown of the\namounts in this column for Mr. Alegre are $5,400,000 for severance and $247,808 for prorated annual\nbonus. The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Zerza are $4,000,000 for severance and\n$220,274 for prorated annual bonus. The breakdown of the amounts in this column for Mr. Bulatao are\n$4,000,000 for severance and $183,562 for prorated annual bonus. The breakdown of the amounts in this\ncolumn for Mr. Dixton are $2,625,000 for severance and $103,253 for prorated annual bonus. The\nseverance and prorated bonus payments are all \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which means that payment of\nthese amounts is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or following the closing\nof the merger. Messrs. Zerza, Bulatao and Dixton are each entitled to terminate their employment within\n60 days following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, which will be deemed a qualifying\ntermination. Under their employment agreements, each of Messrs. Kotick, Zerza, Alegre, Bulatao and\nDixton are subject to post-termination covenants, including non-solicitation covenants, in favor of\nActivision Blizzard and its affiliates.\nEquity. The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate values of the accelerated vesting of the RSUs\nwhich would be assumed by Microsoft for Messrs. Zerza, Alegre, Bulatao and Dixton (and for PSUs,\nassumes target performance). These amounts are \u201cdouble trigger\u201d in nature, which means that the\naccelerated vesting is conditioned upon a qualifying termination of employment on or after the closing\nof the merger. Messrs. Zerza, Bulatao and Dixton are each entitled to terminate their employment within\n60 days following the six-month anniversary of the effective time, which will be deemed a qualifying\ntermination. Mr. Kotick does not currently hold any equity awards for which vesting would accelerate\nupon the closing of the merger or upon a termination of employment following the closing of the merger.\nPerquisites/Benefits. The amounts in this column reflect the value of continued Activision Blizzard-paid\nhealth insurance coverage for Mr. Kotick for two years and supplemental life insurance benefits through\nOctober 2026 pursuant to his employment agreement with Activision Blizzard, and for Messrs. Zerza,\nAlegre, Bulatao and Dixton reimbursement of COBRA premiums for two years under\n66 \n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n",

This discussion is based upon the Code,\nthe regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department and judicial authorities and published positions of the\nInternal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the \u201cIRS,\u201d all as currently in effect on the date of this proxy\nstatement. These laws may change or be subject to differing interpretations, possibly retroactively, and any\nchange or differing interpretation could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought\nand do not intend to seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. This discussion\nassumes that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the merger agreement and as described in\nthis proxy statement.\nIf a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nholds shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, the tax treatment of a person treated as a partner in such\npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Such partnerships and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax\nadvisors about the tax consequences of the merger to them.\nHolders are urged to consult with their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the merger to them in light\nof their particular situations, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Activision Blizzard common stock\nthat is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\na corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or\norganized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\na trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more United States\npersons (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be\ntreated as a United States person\u037e or\nan estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.\nThis discussion assumes that U.S. Holders of Activision Blizzard common stock hold their shares as a capital\nasset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this\ndiscussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to U.S. Holders\nin light of their particular circumstances or that may be applicable to U.S. Holders if such holders are subject\nto special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including any holder that is:\n67 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na bank or other financial institution\u037e\na tax-exempt or governmental organization\u037e\na partnership, subchapter S corporation or other pass-through entity or an investor in the foregoing\u037e\nan insurance company\u037e\na regulated investment company or real estate investment trust\u037e\na mutual fund\u037e\na broker or dealer in securities, stocks, commodities or currencies\u037e\na trader in securities who elects the mark-to-market method of accounting for securities\u037e\na U.S. expatriate, former citizen or long-term resident of the United States\u037e\na person who actually or constructively owned more than five percent (5%) (by vote or value) of the\noutstanding shares of Activision Blizzard common stock at any time during the five-year period\nending on the date of the merger\u037e\nan Activision Blizzard stockholder who received Activision Blizzard common stock through the\nexercise of employee stock options or through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as\ncompensation\u037e\na person that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar\u037e\na person subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect\nto Activision Blizzard common stock being taken into account in an \u201capplicable financial statement\u201d\nas defined in Section 451(b) of the Code\u037e\na holder of options granted under any Activision Blizzard benefit plan\u037e or\nan Activision Blizzard stockholder who holds Activision Blizzard common stock as part of a hedge,\nstraddle or a constructive sale or conversion transaction.\nActivision Blizzard stockholders that are not U.S. Holders may have different U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences than those described below and are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the\ntax treatment of the merger to them under U.S. and non-U.S. laws.\nThe following discussion does not address the tax consequences of any transactions effectuated before,\nafter or at the same time as the merger, whether or not in connection with the merger, including, without\nlimitation, the tax consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to purchase shares of\nActivision Blizzard common stock.\nTax Consequences of the Merger\nThe receipt of the merger consideration by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nTherefore, a U.S. Holder who receives the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Activision Blizzard\ncommon stock pursuant to the merger generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if\nany, between (i) the amount of cash received in the merger and (ii) the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its\nActivision Blizzard common stock exchanged therefor.\nA U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will generally equal the\nprice the U.S. Holder paid for such shares. Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be\neligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that are applicable to long-term capital gains if the U.S.\nHolder has held its Activision Blizzard common stock for more than one year as of the effective date of the\nmerger. Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to short-term capital gains (and\ntaxed at ordinary income tax rates) if the U.S. Holder has held its Activision Blizzard common stock for one\nyear or less as of the date of the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S.\nHolder acquired different blocks of Activision Blizzard common stock at different times or different prices,\nthe U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis and holding period separately for each block of Activision\nBlizzard common stock.\n68 \n",

Microsoft will, after good faith consultation with\nActivision Blizzard and after considering, in good faith, Activision Blizzard\u2019s views and comments, control\nand lead all communications, negotiations, timing decisions and strategy on behalf of the parties relating to\nregulatory approvals.\nIf and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Microsoft, Sub and, solely to the\nextent requested by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent\ndecree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of assets\n(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Activision Blizzard\u037e and (B) any other\nrestrictions on the activities of Activision Blizzard\u037e and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal\nproceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of\nthe merger.

The effect of the Second Request is to\nextend the waiting period imposed under the HSR Act until the 30th day after substantial compliance by\nActivision Blizzard and Microsoft with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by\nthe FTC or as otherwise agreed between the parties and the FTC. Completion of the transaction remains\nsubject to the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the satisfaction or\nwaiver of the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement. The parties expect to complete the\ntransaction in Microsoft\u2019s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting\nperiod under the HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the\nantitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to\nlicense, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before\nor after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the\nHSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the\npublic interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the\nantitrust laws under certain circumstances.\nForeign Competition Laws\nEuropean Union. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard conduct business across the European Union in\nmultiple Member States. Under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of January 2004, as amended, and the\nrules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which we refer to as the \u201cEU Merger Regulation,\u201d mergers and\nacquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and individual European Union sales exceeding specified\nthresholds must be notified to, and approved by, the European Commission before they are implemented.\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard meet the thresholds set out in the EU Merger Regulation and are therefore\nobligated to (i) notify the European Commission of Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and (ii) wait\nto implement the merger until after the European Commission has issued a decision declaring the merger\ncompatible with the common market (and/or if the European Commission has referred any aspect of the\nmerger to one or more competent authorities of a European Union member state under Article 9 of the EU\nMerger Regulation or an EFTA state under Article 6 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement, until each\ncompetent authority has issued a clearance or a confirmation that the merger may proceed). As is customary,\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard intend to file a formal notification as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nUnited Kingdom. With respect to the United Kingdom, the parties intend to notify the merger to the\nCompetition and Markets Authority, which we refer to as the \u201cCMA,\u201d under the Enterprise Act 2002. The\nCMA may issue an order that, among other things, prevents the completion of the merger or prevents the\nintegration of the parties\u2019 businesses. The practical effect of this is typically that the merger may not be\ncompleted until the merger has been notified to the CMA and the merging parties have obtained clearance.\nMicrosoft and Activision Blizzard intend to file a formal notification as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nChina. In addition, under the Antimonopoly Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, transactions involving\nparties with sales above certain revenue levels cannot be completed until they are reviewed and approved by\nthe State Administration for Market Regulation, which we refer to as \u201cSAMR.\u201d Microsoft and Activision\nBlizzard have sufficient revenues to exceed SAMR\u2019s statutory thresholds for review, and completion of the\nmerger is therefore conditioned upon SAMR approval. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard intend to submit a\ndraft notification to SAMR as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nThe merger is also subject to clearance or approval by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions.\nThe merger cannot be completed until Microsoft and Activision Blizzard obtain clearance to\n70 \n",

Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, in consultation and cooperation\nwith each other, will file notifications, as required by competition authorities in certain other jurisdictions, as\npromptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement. The relevant competition authorities could\ntake such actions under applicable competition laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking\ndivestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or\nto terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs,\ndivestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the completion, or reduce the anticipated benefits, of\nthe merger. There is no assurance that Microsoft and Activision Blizzard will obtain all required regulatory\nclearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain the necessary clearances in any of these\njurisdictions could substantially delay or prevent the consummation of the merger, which could negatively\nimpact both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.\nForeign Direct Investment Laws\nCompletion of the merger is further subject to receipt of certain other foreign direct investment review\napprovals, including notification, clearance and/or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period\nin certain specified countries.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nOne or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation\nwhen it grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene\nin the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could\nsignificantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to\npredict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will\nultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by Activision\nBlizzard stockholders and the completion of the merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure\nyou that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the\ngranting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional\nconditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement. These\nconditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.\nLegal Proceedings Regarding the Merger\nFollowing the announcement of the transaction, complaints were filed in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California, the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against\nActivision Blizzard and its directors: Stein v. Activision Blizzard, Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-01560 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e\nPerry v. Activision Blizzard, Inc. et al., No. 1:22-cv-02074 (S.D.N.Y.)\u037e Whitfield v.

The complaints each assert violations of Section\n14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and allege that the preliminary proxy statement filed in\nconnection with the proposed transaction between Activision Blizzard and Microsoft omitted certain\npurportedly material information which rendered the preliminary proxy statement incomplete and misleading.\nSpecifically, the complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement failed to disclose material information\nregarding the sales process, Activision Blizzard\u2019s projections and the financial analyses of Activision\nBlizzard\u2019s financial advisor. The complaints seek, among other things, an order to enjoin the transaction\nunless and until additional disclosures are issued\u037e and, if the transaction closes, damages. The Watson\ncomplaint also alleges that Activision Blizzard\u2019s directors entered into the transaction for self-interested\nreasons, including receipt of personal benefits in the transaction.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\n2021, three putative shareholder derivative actions were filed in California Superior Court, County of Los\nAngeles, and those cases have now been consolidated in an action entitled York County on Behalf of\nCounty of York Retirement Fund v. Robert A. Kotick, et al., No. 21STCV28949 (Cal. Super. Ct., L.A. Cty.). On\nNovember 15, 2021, a putative shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court,\nCentral District of California, entitled Luke Kahnert v. Robert A. Kotick, et al., No. 2:21-cv-08968-PA-JEM\n(C.D. Cal.). The putative derivative actions collectively assert claims on Activision Blizzard\u2019s behalf against\nthirteen current or former officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust\nenrichment, misappropriation, contribution, and alleged violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act based\non allegations similar to those in the DFEH Matter and in the securities class action. Activision Blizzard is\nnamed as a nominal defendant. In addition, the plaintiffs in the Kahnert action sought leave to amend their\ncomplaint to assert putative class claims for breach of fiduciary duty against Activision Blizzard\u2019s directors\nin connection with the proposed acquisition by Microsoft, along with an aiding and abetting claim against\nMicrosoft. Specifically, the proposed amended complaint alleges that Activision Blizzard\u2019s directors entered\ninto the transaction pursuant to a flawed and conflicted process allegedly designed to absolve the directors\nfrom liability for failure to oversee Activision Blizzard in connection with the DFEH Matter and the SEC,\nsecurities and derivative matters. Plaintiffs also claim that Microsoft was aware of the directors\u2019 and officers\u2019\npurported breaches of fiduciary duty by virtue of the public allegations, and nonetheless agreed to\ntransaction terms that unjustly reward the individual defendants. Defendants opposed Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for\nleave to amend and the Court denied the motion in an order dated March 4, 2022.\nActivision Blizzard is cooperating with an investigation by the SEC regarding disclosures on employment\nmatters and related issues including responding to subpoenas from the SEC. The SEC has also issued\nsubpoenas to a number of current and former executives and other employees in connection with this matter.\nOn March 3, 2022, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los\nAngeles, captioned Moynihan & Moynihan v. Activision Publishing, Inc., No. 22STCV07890 (Cal. Super. Ct.,\nL.A. Cty.). The complaint asserts claims for wrongful death, work environment sexual harassment and failure\nto prevent harassment in connection with the death of a female employee.\nFurther information about these matters, to the extent they were filed by the filing date of the 2021 10-K, can\nbe found in the 2021 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.\nUnionization Efforts\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. At Raven\nSoftware, one of our studios, the Communications Workers of America has filed a petition to represent a unit\nof employees, and the National Labor Relations Board will oversee the election process, including a\ndetermination of the appropriate set of employees who would be included in any bargaining unit (and thus\nparticipate in the election on potential unionization).\nFurther information about these matters can be found in the 2021 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in\nthis proxy statement.\n73 ",

This compensation will be\nprovided in the form of a cash payment (less applicable taxes) or a new equity award, as reasonably\ndetermined by Microsoft.\nExchange and Payment Procedures\nPrior to the closing of the merger, Microsoft will designate a bank or trust company, which we refer to as the\n\u201cpaying agent,\u201d to make payments of the merger consideration to Activision Blizzard stockholders. At or\npromptly following the effective time of the merger, Microsoft will deposit or cause to be deposited with the\npaying agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate per share merger consideration to Activision Blizzard\nstockholders in accordance with the merger agreement.\nAs soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send to\neach holder of record of shares of common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions advising\nstockholders how to surrender stock certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for the per share merger\nconsideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or\ndestroyed certificates, together with any required bond) with respect to shares of common stock represented\nby stock certificates or a customary \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with respect to book-entry shares representing the\nshares of common stock and (2) a signed letter of transmittal (in the case of common stock represented by\nstock certificates) and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of\nsuch shares will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration in exchange therefor, without\ninterest. The amount of any per share merger consideration paid to Activision Blizzard stockholders may be\nreduced by any applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld.\nIf any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the\nmerger, such cash will be returned to Microsoft, upon demand, and any stockholders who have not complied\nwith the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Microsoft for satisfaction\nof their claims for payment. None of Microsoft, Sub, Activision Blizzard, the surviving corporation or the\npaying agent will be liable to any Activision Blizzard stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly\ndelivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar\nlaw.\nThe letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such\ncertificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any certificates have been lost, stolen or\ndestroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration,\nMicrosoft or the paying agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the\nmerger consideration, require such stockholder to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction and to\ndeliver a bond in such amount as Microsoft or the paying agent may direct as indemnity against any claim\nthat may be made against Microsoft, the surviving corporation or the paying agent with respect to such\ncertificate.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nThe merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft and Sub.\nSome of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by Activision Blizzard are qualified\nas to \u201cmateriality\u201d or \u201cCompany Material Adverse Effect.\u201d For purposes of the merger agreement,

We refer to these requirements\nas the ownership conditions. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek\nappraisal of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock, Activision Blizzard believes that if a stockholder is\nconsidering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. A\nstockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration as\ndescribed in the merger agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented such shares\nof Activision Blizzard common stock.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the following:\nthe stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal\u037e\nthe stockholder must deliver to Activision Blizzard a written demand for appraisal before the vote on\nthe merger proposal at the special meeting\u037e\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the\neffective time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before\nthe effective time)\u037e and\nthe stockholder (or a beneficial owner of shares on whose behalf the stockholder demanded\nappraisal) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective\ndate of the merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no\nintention of doing so.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver\nto Activision Blizzard, before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for\nthe appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal\neither in person or by proxy. A holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock exercising appraisal\nrights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue\nto hold the shares of record through the effective time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain\nvoting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal, and it will cause a\nstockholder to lose the stockholder\u2019s right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written\ndemand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal\nrights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the merger proposal or abstain from\nvoting on the merger proposal. However, neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from\nvoting or failing to vote on the merger proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for\nappraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to\nand separate from any proxy or vote on the merger proposal. A proxy or vote against the merger proposal will\nnot constitute a demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote\non the merger proposal at the special meeting will cause the stockholder to lose its appraisal rights in\nconnection with the merger.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights\nfor the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Activision\nBlizzard common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably\ninform Activision Blizzard of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand\nappraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a\nfiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on\nbehalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint\ntenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners.

        "Section Text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\u200b\nsurviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair values of shares\nof Activision Blizzard common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock who desire to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware should\nassume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware in the manner prescribed in Section 262.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of\nshares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written\nrequest, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares\nnot voted in favor of the merger proposal and with respect to which Activision Blizzard received demands for\nappraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must mail this\nstatement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a\nstatement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever\nis later.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock and a\ncopy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated\nwithin 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing\nthe names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. We refer to this below as the verified list.\nAfter notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is\nempowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with\nSection 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock\ncertificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings,\nand if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may\ndismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. In addition, assuming Activision Blizzard common stock\nremains listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time (which we expect to be\nthe case), the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is required to dismiss the appraisal proceedings as\nto all holders of dissenting shares unless one of the ownership conditions is satisfied.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Activision Blizzard common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will appraise the \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,\ntogether with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The appraisal\nproceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,\nincluding any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. In determining fair value, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the\nSupreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an\nappraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally\nconsidered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered,\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a\ncompany.\u201d Section 262 provides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of\nDelaware stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of\nvalue,\u201d but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment\nor expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that \u201celements of future value,\nincluding the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger\nand not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so\ndetermined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be more than, the same as or less than\nthe consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares\n104 TABLE OF CONTENTS\nand that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the\nconsideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value\nunder Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Activision Blizzard believes that the merger consideration is fair,\nno representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in\na determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Neither Activision\nBlizzard nor Microsoft anticipates offering more than the $95.00 per share consideration to any stockholder\nof Activision Blizzard exercising appraisal rights. Each of Activision Blizzard and Microsoft reserves the right\nto assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the \u201cfair value\u201d of a share of\nActivision Blizzard common stock is less than the $95.00 per share consideration.\nUpon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may,\nin its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders\nentitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of Activision Blizzard common stock whose name appears on\nthe verified list and, if such shares are represented by certificates and if so required, who has submitted such\nstockholder\u2019s certificates of Activision Blizzard common stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to\nappraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,\ntogether with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will\nbe made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and in the case of\nholders of shares represented by certificates, upon the surrender to the surviving corporation of the\ncertificate(s) representing such stock. The Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s decree may be enforced as other\ndecrees in such court may be enforced.\nUnless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be\ncompounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and\nthe date of payment of the judgment\u037e provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the\namount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d of\nthe shares as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii) any interest accrued\nprior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no\nobligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal\nproceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined\nby the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a\nstockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the\nfees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Activision Blizzard common stock under\nSection 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder\u2019s right to appraisal, the\nstockholder\u2019s shares of Activision Blizzard common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the\neffective time into the right to receive the merger consideration less applicable withholding taxes. A\nstockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder\u2019s right to appraisal if no petition for\nappraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, if neither of the ownership conditions\nis satisfied or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s\ndemand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote\nActivision Blizzard common stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions\non the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of Activision Blizzard common\nstock, if any, payable to stockholders of Activision Blizzard of record as of a time prior to\n105 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe effective time\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers\nto the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the\nmerger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of\nthe corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is\nfiled with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be\ndismissed as to any stockholder of Activision Blizzard without the approval of the court\u037e provided that this\nprovision will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or\njoined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept\nthe terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.\nFailure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s\nstatutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder of Activision Blizzard wishing to exercise appraisal\nrights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.\n106 \n",

If\nthe certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including\nthose set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.\nAppraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:\nIf a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this\nsection is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less\nthan 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the\nrecord date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance\nwith \u00a7 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available\npursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all\nof the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this\nsection and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of\nthis title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares shall\ndeliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a\nwritten demand for appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares\u037e provided that a demand may be\ndelivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand\nwill be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and\nthat the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder\u2019s shares. A\nproxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A\nstockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein\nprovided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the\nsurviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent\ncorporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented\nto the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become\neffective\u037e or\nIf the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to \u00a7 228, \u00a7 251(h), \u00a7 253, or \u00a7 267 of this\ntitle, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify\neach of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are\nentitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal\nrights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent\ncorporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent\ncorporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of \u00a7 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if\ngiven on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such\nstockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to\nappraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a\nmerger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the\noffer contemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice,\ndemand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder\u2019s\nshares\u037e provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission\nif directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose\nin such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the\nidentity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal\nof such holder\u2019s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the\nmerger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second\nnotice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of\nany class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights\nof the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting\ncorporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within\nB-2 \n(e) \n(f) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n10 days after such effective date\u037e provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more\nthan 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved\npursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer\ncontemplated by \u00a7 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice,\nsuch second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights\nand who has demanded appraisal of such holder\u2019s shares in accordance with this subsection.\nAn affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation\nthat is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of\nfraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the\nstockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in\nadvance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,\nprovided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or\nconsolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the\nnotice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the\nday next preceding the day on which the notice is given.\nWithin 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section\nhereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by\nfiling a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all\nsuch stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective\ndate of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such\nstockholder\u2019s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or\nconsolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any\nstockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section\nhereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information\nprocessing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall\nbe entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation\na statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or\nconsolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of this title, the aggregate\nnumber of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in \u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were\nthe subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer\nreferred to in \u00a7 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have\nbeen received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given\nto the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder\u2019s request for such a statement is received\nby the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for\ndelivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of\nsuch stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such\nperson\u2019s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this\nsubsection.\nUpon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon\nthe surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the\noffice of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the\nnames and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with\nwhom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or\nresulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the\npetition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered\nby the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by\nregistered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown\non the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more\npublications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation\npublished in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable.\nThe forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs\nthereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-3 \n(g) \n(h) \n(i) \n(j) \n(k) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAt the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied\nwith this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the\nstockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by\ncertificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of\nthe pendency of the appraisal proceedings\u037e and if any stockholder fails to comply with such\ndirection, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the\nmerger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as\nto which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall\ndismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal\nrights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding\nshares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the\nmerger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was\napproved pursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\nAfter the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall\nbe conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine\nthe fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or\nexpectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the\namount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into\naccount all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause\nshown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger\nthrough the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5%\nover the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time\nduring the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the\njudgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation\nmay pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall\naccrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the\namount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest\ntheretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting\ncorporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court\nmay, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the\nstockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the\nsurviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted\nsuch stockholder\u2019s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled\nto appraisal rights under this section.\nThe Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by\nthe surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so\nmade to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the\ncase of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the\ncertificates representing such stock. The Court\u2019s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the\nCourt of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a\ncorporation of this State or of any state.\nThe costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the\nCourt deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may\norder all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal\nproceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the fees and expenses of\nexperts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.\nFrom and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded\nappraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for\nany purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except\ndividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation)\u037e provided, however, that if no petition for an\nappraisal\nB-4 \n(l) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nshall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall\ndeliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder\u2019s demand\nfor an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or\nthereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an\nappraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of\nChancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such\napproval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just\u037e provided, however that this\nprovision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder\u2019s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the\neffective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.\nThe shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting\nstockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall\nhave the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.\nB-5 \n",
