        "Section Header": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS",
        "Section Text": "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGERS\nThe following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposed Mergers.\nThese questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a common stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed\ninformation contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, as well as the additional documents to which it refers or which it incorporates by reference,\nincluding the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A.\nQ:\nWhat is the proposed transaction?\nA:\nThe proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company, including the Partnership, by affiliates of Blackstone pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement. After the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been approved by our common\nstockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub II will merge with and into\nthe Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the Surviving Partnership, and Merger Sub I will merge with and into the Company, with the\nCompany continuing as the Surviving Company. The Mergers will occur at the time provided in the Merger Agreement.\nFor additional information about the Mergers, please review the Merger Agreement, attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and incorporated\nby reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document\ngoverning the Mergers.\nQ:\nAs a common stockholder, what will I receive in the Company Merger?\nA:\nFor each outstanding share of Common Stock that you own immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, you will receive the merger\nconsideration, which is $187.50 in cash, without interest and less the per share amount of the Closing Cash Dividend (and any Additional Dividend)\nand any applicable withholding taxes.\nQ:\nWill I receive any regular quarterly dividends or any other dividends with respect to the shares of Common Stock that I own?\nA:\nOn February 2, 2022, our board of directors authorized and we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share of Common Stock for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2022, which was paid in cash on March 31, 2022, to holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on\nMarch 16, 2022. Additionally, on April 29, 2022, our board of directors authorized and we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share of\nCommon Stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, which will be payable in cash on June 30, 2022, to holders of record of our Common Stock at the\nclose of business on June 15, 2022. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may make, declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends to\nholders of Common Stock and to holders of common units of partnership interest of the Partnership, in an amount of up to $1.05 per share or unit\n(with declaration, record and payment dates consistent with historical declaration, record and payment dates from fiscal year 2021), including a pro\nrata distribution in respect of any stub period.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement we are also permitted to authorize, declare and pay any Additional Dividend, which are dividends to the\nholders of our Common Stock during the term of the Merger Agreement that are determined by us to be reasonably necessary to maintain our\nstatus as a REIT under the Code or to avoid the imposition of income or excise tax or any other entity-level tax. Additionally, immediately prior to\nthe Partnership Merger Effective Time, we will be required to pay the Closing Cash Dividend, which is a dividend to holders of record of our\nCommon Stock as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the closing date in an amount reasonably determined by the\nCompany in consultation with Parent equal to or in excess of the sum of (i) the amount required to be distributed to avoid the imposition of income\nor excise tax or any other entity-level tax for the Company\u2019s hypothetical short\n-16-Table of Contents\ntaxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers or the Company\u2019s taxable year ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) the estimated\naccumulated earnings and profits of the Company, calculated pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations, for the Company\u2019s hypothetical short\ntaxable year ending on the closing date as a result of the Mergers, so long as any such Closing Cash Dividend is no greater than the cash available\nfor distribution. Each of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, will reduce the per share merger consideration received by\nholders of Common Stock in the Company Merger by an amount equal to the per share amount of such dividend.\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the Mergers to be completed?\nA:\nIf our common stockholders vote to approve the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and\nassuming that the other conditions to the Mergers are satisfied or waived, it is currently anticipated that the Mergers will be completed in the third\nquarter of 2022. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Mergers will take place on the third business day after satisfaction or waiver\nof the conditions to the Mergers described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014 Conditions to the Mergers\u201d (other than those conditions that by\ntheir nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Mergers, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or on such other date as\nmay be mutually agreed in writing by us and Parent. For further information regarding the timing of the closing of the Mergers, see \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement \u2014 Effective Times\u037e Closing Date.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat happens if the Company Merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the Company Merger is not approved by our common stockholders, or if the Company Merger is not completed for any other reason, our\ncommon stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Instead, the Company\nwill remain a public company and shares of Common Stock and depositary shares with respect to the Preferred Stock will continue to be registered\nunder the Exchange Act and listed on the NYSE, and our Common Stock, Preferred Stock (and depositary shares in respect thereof), equity awards\nand partnership interests of the Partnership will remain outstanding. Upon a termination of the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, we\nwill be required to pay Parent the Company termination fee. In certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay us the Parent termination\nfee upon a termination of the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nIf the Company Merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nFollowing the completion of the Company Merger, your shares of Common Stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your\nportion of the merger consideration. Shortly after the Company Merger is completed, you will receive instructions describing how you may\nsurrender your shares of Common Stock for the merger consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker,\nbank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect\nthe surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the merger consideration.\nQ:\nWhen and where is the special meeting?\nA:\nThe special meeting will be held on July 15, 2022, at 10 a.m., Pacific time, at the Westin Pasadena at 191 N Los Robles Ave, Pasadena, CA 91101.\nQ:\nWho can vote and attend the special meeting?\nA:\nAll holders of record of shares of Common Stock as of the record date, which was the close of business on June 7, 2022, are entitled to receive\nnotice of and attend and vote at the special meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the special meeting. Each common stockholder will be\nentitled to cast one\n-17-\nTable of Contents\nvote on each matter presented at the special meeting for each share of Common Stock that such holder owned as of the record date.\nThe vote of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) is not required to approve any of the proposals at the\nspecial meeting and is not being solicited.\nQ:\nWhat is the quorum requirement for the special meeting?\nA:\nThe presence in person or by proxy of our common stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting\nwill constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. Abstentions will\nbe counted as shares present for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If you fail to submit a proxy prior to the special meeting or\nto vote in person at the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will not be counted toward a quorum.\nQ:\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve the Company Merger?\nA:\nApproval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of\nissued and outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Because the required vote for this\nproposal is based on the number of votes our common stockholders are entitled to cast rather than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your\nshares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and abstentions will have the same\neffect as voting \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the Company Merger.\nQ:\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become\npayable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Company Merger?\nA:\nApproval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based\non or otherwise relates to the Company Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this\nproposal, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and\nabstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nQ:\nWhat vote of common stockholders is required to approve adjournments of the special meeting?\nA:\nApproval of any adjournment of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the special meeting to approve\nthe proposal to approve the Company Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. For the purpose of this\nproposal, failure to vote your shares of Common Stock (including failure to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee) and\nabstentions will have no effect on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present.\nQ:\nWhy is my vote important?\nA:\nIf you do not authorize your proxy or voting instructions or vote at the special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary\nquorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, because the proposal to approve the Company Merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of\nthe stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the holders of issued and outstanding Common\nStock, your failure to authorize your proxy or voting instructions or to vote at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe approval of the Company Merger.\n-18-\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nHow does the merger consideration compare to the market price of the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nThe merger consideration of $187.50 per share in cash represents a premium of approximately 15% to the volume weighted average share price over\nthe 60 days prior to announcement of the proposed transaction.\nQ:\nHow does our board of directors recommend that I vote?\nA:\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the Company Merger, \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the\nmerger-related compensation, and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation payable to our\nnamed executive officers?\nA:\nThe SEC has adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or\nbecome payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate transactions such as the Company Merger.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the non-binding proposal to approve the merger-related compensation?\nA:\nThe proposal to approve the merger-related compensation is a proposal separate and apart from the proposal to approve the Company Merger.\nApproval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Mergers. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote only, and it is not binding\non us or our board of directors. Further, the underlying arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder\napproval.

Specific instructions to be followed by\nstockholders of record interested in authorizing a proxy via the Internet or by telephone are shown on the accompanying proxy card. Internet and\ntelephone procedures are designed to authenticate the stockholder\u2019s identity and to allow stockholders to authorize a proxyholder to vote the\nstockholder\u2019s shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. A common stockholder that authorizes a vote through the\nInternet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and\ntelephone companies, which will be borne by the stockholder.\nQ:\nHow do I cast my vote if my shares of Common Stock are held of record in a \u201cstreet name\u201d?\nA:\nIf your shares are held in a \u201cstreet name\u201d through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must direct your intermediary regarding how you would like\nyour shares voted by following the voting instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee\u037e or, if you want to participate in the\nspecial meeting, you must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee.\nQ:\nWhat will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?\nA:\nWith respect to the proposal to approve the Company Merger, if you abstain from voting and fail to cast your vote in person at the special meeting\nor by proxy, or if you hold your shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee,\nit will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Company Merger. With respect to the proposal to approve the merger-related compensation\nand the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting, if you abstain from voting or you fail to cast your vote in person at the special\nmeeting or by proxy, or if you hold your shares of Common Stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other\nnominee, it will not have any effect on the outcome of such proposals, assuming a quorum is present.\nQ:\nHow will proxy holders vote my shares of Common Stock?\nA:\nIf you properly authorize a proxy prior to the special meeting, your shares of Common Stock will be voted as you direct. If you authorize a proxy but\nno direction is otherwise made, your shares of Common Stock will be voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the Company Merger, \u201cFOR\u201d the\nproposal to approve the merger-related compensation and \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting. Pursuant to the\nMaryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the special\nmeeting.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell shares of Common Stock before the special meeting?\nA:\nIf you held shares of Common Stock on the record date but transfer them prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, you will retain your right to\nvote at the special meeting, but not the right to receive the merger consideration for those shares. The right to receive such consideration when the\nCompany Merger becomes effective will pass to the person who at that time owns the shares of Common Stock you previously owned.\nQ:\nCan I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you own shares of Common Stock as a record holder on the record date, you may revoke a previously authorized proxy at any time before it\nis exercised by filing with our Corporate Secretary a notice of revocation or a duly authorized proxy bearing a later date or by attending the special\nmeeting and voting in person at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a previously\nauthorized proxy. If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares of Common Stock, the foregoing options for changing\nyour vote do not apply, and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.\n-20-\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers?\nA:\nWe intend to treat the distribution of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, as a dividend distribution to holders of\nshares of Common Stock to the extent of the Company\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Further, we intend to designate the Closing\nCash Dividend, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, as a \u201ccapital gains dividend\u201d under Section 857(b) of the Code. Each of the\nClosing Cash Dividend and the Additional Dividends, if any, will reduce the per share merger consideration by an amount equal to the per share\namount of such dividend.\nThe receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes.\nYou should consult your own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to you of the receipt of the Closing Cash Dividend and the Additional\nDividends, if any, and the per share merger consideration received in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company Merger in\nlight of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax laws). For further\ndiscussion, see \u201cThe Mergers \u2014 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat rights do I have if I oppose the Mergers?\nA:\nIf you are a common stockholder of record on the record date, you can vote against the proposal to approve the Company Merger.

Our board of directors has made no\nsuch determination. See \u201cNo Dissenters\u2019 Rights of Appraisal.\u201d\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nWe intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed\nwith the SEC following the special meeting.

        "Section Header": "Background of the Mergers",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Mergers\nOur board of directors and senior management regularly review our performance and prospects in light of the current business, economic, capital\nmarkets, and real estate environments, as well as developments in the multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex, and low-rise suburban office space and the\nopportunities and challenges facing participants in those businesses. These reviews have included consideration, from time to time, of potential strategic\nalternatives, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, the re-weighting of our portfolio of assets to industrial assets, joint ventures, spin-off\ntransactions, and business combination transactions, as well as remaining an independent public company. Our board of directors and senior\nmanagement have considered various challenges that we have faced as a public company, in particular the competitive environment for acquiring\nindustrial and industrial-flex assets and our close to zero tax basis in existing assets, making asset-by-asset dispositions inefficient from a tax perspective,\nas well as the discount to estimated net asset value at which shares of Common Stock have recently traded and the implications of this discount on the\ncost of obtaining capital to fund future acquisitions and growth.\nAdditionally, from time to time, the Chairman of the board of directors, Ronald L. Havner, and our senior management have engaged in discussions\nwith executives of other participants in the real estate industry, including Blackstone, regarding potential acquisitions or dispositions of assets or\nportfolios of assets, as well as potential joint ventures. In January 2021, the Company and Blackstone engaged in discussions regarding the Company\nacquiring a portfolio of industrial properties on the west coast of the United States that Blackstone planned to sell. Blackstone conducted an auction to\nsell these properties, and, after preliminary discussions, the Company determined in March 2021 not to pursue the transaction because, among other\nthings, the competitive dynamic and resulting price expectations meant the acquisition would not be accretive to the Company.\nIn February 2021, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Havner, expressing that Blackstone would be interested in exploring a potential\nacquisition of the Company, and requesting that the Company provide Blackstone with non-public information for such purpose. The conversation was\nhigh level and no specific terms were discussed. On February 24, 2021, the Company and Blackstone entered into a confidentiality agreement, following\nwhich the Company provided Blackstone limited property-level financial information. Over the next few weeks, Blackstone engaged in due diligence on\nthe Company and, on March 11, 2021, Blackstone\u2019s representative telephoned Mr. Havner and informed him that, based on Blackstone\u2019s due diligence\nreview, Blackstone would not be in a position at that time to offer to acquire the Company at a premium to its then-current stock price. On March 11, 2021,\nthe closing price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock was $151.53 per share. Mr. Havner relayed this conversation to the other members of the board.\nAt a meeting of the Company\u2019s board of directors on August 28, 2021, the board of directors reviewed our business performance and outlook in\nlight of general market conditions and considered opportunities and risks in our industrial, flex and office real estate businesses. The board discussed,\namong other things, the Company\u2019s strategic direction, as well as the real estate business environment. At the meeting, in light of the business and real\nestate environment at the time, the board of directors determined to engage Eastdil, which has from time to time acted as a broker for real estate\ntransactions involving the Company, to assist the board in confidentially evaluating strategic options and assessing the value of the Company and its\nassets. The board of directors directed management to assist Eastdil in preparing its evaluation, with the results of such evaluation to be presented to the\nboard at a meeting later in 2021.\n-34-Table of Contents\nOn October 26, 2021, during a meeting of the Company\u2019s board of directors, which was attended by the Company\u2019s senior management, Eastdil\npresented its assessment of the state of the real estate industry, including the industrial, flex, and office sectors. Representatives of Eastdil also presented\na preliminary valuation of the Company and the assets in the Company\u2019s portfolio and discussed with the board possible approaches to creating value\nthrough strategic acquisitions and dispositions The board discussed with management and Eastdil the benefits and risks of pursuing such opportunities,\nand instructed management and Eastdil to continue reviewing such strategic acquisitions and dispositions.\nOn December 1, 2021, a representative of Blackstone contacted a representative of Eastdil to discuss the Company and the Company\u2019s real estate\nportfolio. Blackstone\u2019s representative was aware that the Company had previously worked with Eastdil with respect to acquisitions and dispositions of\nreal estate assets. The representative of Blackstone indicated that Blackstone would be interested in discussing an acquisition of the entire Company.\nBlackstone\u2019s representative did not propose a valuation of the Company, stating that before proposing a purchase price, Blackstone would need access\nto certain confidential information regarding the Company. Blackstone\u2019s representative then asked that the representative of Eastdil communicate\nBlackstone\u2019s interest to the Company, including with respect to receiving confidential information of the Company.\nBetween December 2, 2021 and December 4, 2021, representatives of Eastdil conveyed their discussions with Blackstone to Mr. Havner and Dan\n\u201cMac\u201d Chandler, III, the Company\u2019s then-President and Chief Executive Officer, including that Blackstone had expressed an interest in potentially making\na proposal to acquire the Company.\nOn December 8, 2021, during a meeting of the Company\u2019s board of directors, which was attended by the Company\u2019s senior management, Mr.\nHavner and Mr. Chandler provided a summary to the other members of the board regarding Blackstone\u2019s renewed interest in potentially acquiring the\nCompany and its request to receive access to certain confidential information of the Company in order to make a proposal to acquire the Company. After\ndiscussion, the board of directors authorized members of management to provide confidential information about the Company to Blackstone in order to\ndetermine Blackstone\u2019s proposed purchase price for an acquisition of the Company.\nOn December 14, 2021, Mr. Chandler discussed with a representative of Blackstone the Company\u2019s willingness to provide confidential information\nof the Company so that Blackstone could provide a proposed purchase price, subject to the parties entering into a new confidentiality agreement given\nthe earlier confidentiality agreement was scheduled to expire on February 24, 2022. On December 19, 2021, the Company and Blackstone entered into a\nnew confidentiality agreement. Following the execution of the new confidentiality agreement, the Company granted access to an electronic data room to\nrepresentatives of Blackstone and Blackstone commenced its extensive due diligence review, including of property-level information, which continued\nuntil the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nOn January 6, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Havner to update Mr. Havner on Blackstone\u2019s extensive due diligence efforts and\ninformed Mr. Havner that Blackstone intended to propose a specific purchase price for the Company in the near future.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Company announced that Mr. Chandler would take a temporary leave of absence for health reasons unrelated to the\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, effective January 17, 2022. The Company also announced that in connection with Mr. Chandler\u2019s leave of absence, on\nJanuary 17, 2022, the board of directors appointed Stephen W. Wilson, a member of the Company\u2019s board, to serve as interim President and Chief\nExecutive Officer and Maria R. Hawthorne, a member of the Company\u2019s board, to serve as interim Chief Operating Officer, until Mr. Chandler returned from\nhis leave of absence. Subsequently on March 23, 2022, the Company announced that Mr. Chandler would step down as President and Chief Executive\nOfficer. On April 5, 2022, the Company announced that Mr. Wilson had been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and that he\nwould continue to serve as a member of the board of directors.\n-35-\nTable of Contents\nOn February 3, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted representatives of Eastdil to orally communicate an indicative purchase price for all\nof the outstanding shares of Common Stock and all outstanding common units of partnership interest of the Partnership not owned by the Company of\n$188.00 per share/unit in cash. The representative of Blackstone did not outline any other terms of the proposal. Thereafter on February 3, 2022,\nrepresentatives of Eastdil contacted Mr. Havner and Mr. Wilson to summarize the conversation with Blackstone\u2019s representative, including the proposed\nindicative purchase price.\nOn February 8, 2022, during a meeting of the Company\u2019s board of directors, which was attended by the Company\u2019s senior management, Mr. Havner\nand members of the Company\u2019s senior management provided an update on discussions with Blackstone, including the February 3, 2022 indicative\npurchase price of $188.00 per share/unit. During the meeting, the board discussed, among other things, general real estate and economic conditions and\nthe Company\u2019s potential opportunities and strategic direction, including potential monetization opportunities and the standalone case as an independent\npublic company, and the benefits and risks related to each, including those discussed at prior meetings of the board of directors. Following discussion,\nthe board determined that the Company should communicate to Blackstone that its indicative purchase price was too low and that, based on current\nmarket conditions at the time, any indicative purchase price should be at least $200.00 per share/unit. Following further discussions, the board determined\nto reconvene in the coming days to receive any updates and further discuss the indicative purchase price and potential next steps.\nOn February 9, 2022, Mr. Havner communicated to representatives of Eastdil the board of directors\u2019 view that the indicative purchase price of\n$188.00 per share/unit was too low at this time, and that any indicative purchase price should be at least $200.00 per share/unit. Representatives of Eastdil\nsubsequently communicated the board\u2019s views to representatives of Blackstone.\nOn February 12, 2022, representatives of Blackstone contacted representatives of Eastdil to inform them that Blackstone was not prepared to offer\nmore than $188.00 per share/unit. Representatives of Eastdil subsequently communicated Blackstone\u2019s unwillingness to increase the indicative purchase\nprice to Mr. Havner and Mr. Wilson.\nOn February 13, 2022, during a meeting of the Company\u2019s board of directors, which was attended by the Company\u2019s senior management, Mr.\nHavner, Mr. Wilson, and other members of management provided an update on the discussions with Blackstone and Eastdil and continued their\ndiscussion of Blackstone\u2019s proposal, the general market conditions, and the Company\u2019s performance and opportunities. Following discussion, the board\nof directors authorized management to evaluate beginning a confidential process to explore potential strategic alternatives with the goal of enhancing\nstockholder value, which could include a potential transaction such as a merger, business combination, sale, spin-off, dissolution and distribution of\nassets, or other transaction, as well as the potential for the Company to continue operating its business as a standalone public company. In order to\nfacilitate this process, the board formed an ad-hoc transaction committee of the board of directors comprised of three independent directors (the\n\u201cTransaction Committee\u201d), which would provide advice to members of the Company\u2019s senior management on day-to-day matters involving this process\nand assist in the selection of financial, legal, and other advisors as appropriate. The members of the board of directors named to the Transaction\nCommittee were M. Christian Mitchell, Gary E. Pruitt, and Robert S. Rollo, with Mr. Mitchell appointed Chairman of the Transaction Committee. Thereafter\non numerous occasions, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Wilson discussed various matters related to the potential transaction with Blackstone and the potential\nstrategic alternatives review process, as well as the Company\u2019s standalone business plan, and Mr. Mitchell also discussed these matters with the other\nmembers of the Transaction Committee.\nOn February 14, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting by teleconference during which the Transaction Committee decided that Wachtell,\nLipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d) should be retained by the Company to act as the Company\u2019s legal advisor in connection with the Company\u2019s\nevaluation of strategic alternatives. Additionally, the Transaction Committee determined that, in addition to Eastdil, who would continue to serve as real\nestate advisor to the Company and as a financial advisor, it would be advisable for the\n-36-\nTable of Contents\nCompany to retain an additional financial advisor. Later that week, after meeting with several candidates, based on the recommendation of the Transaction\nCommittee, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as co-financial advisor to the Company in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives. J.P.\nMorgan was selected based on its qualifications, expertise and reputation in the industrial, industrial-flex and office sectors, and its knowledge of the\nbusiness and affairs of the Company and of potential counterparties.\nOn February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine, which conflict escalated throughout the spring of 2022 and\ncontinues as of the date of this proxy statement. Following commencement of the invasion, there was a rapid deterioration of the credit markets, including\nas related to real estate in the United States, and borrowing costs associated with purchasing real estate continued to increase.\nDuring the final week of February and the month of March, members of management worked with Eastdil and J.P. Morgan to prepare for a potential\nprocess to explore potential strategic alternatives for the Company. Also during this period, members of management and the Company\u2019s financial\nadvisors monitored market conditions in light of the war in Ukraine, including the substantial deterioration in the access and the cost of credit relative to\nprior to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Members of management and the Company\u2019s financial advisors continued to evaluate the potential strategic\nalternatives in light of the macroeconomic environment, and compared those alternatives to the Company\u2019s strategic business plan as a standalone public\ncompany. Also during this time, members of management finalized the Company\u2019s projections for 2022 through 2026, which we refer to as the \u201cCompany\nProjections\u201d (discussed in more detail under \u201c\u2014Forward Looking Financial Information\u201d).\nDuring March 2022, representatives of Blackstone continued to discuss with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil a potential acquisition of\nthe Company, taking into account the rapidly deteriorating economic environment and the rise of borrowing costs. Representatives of Blackstone\ncommunicated that Blackstone was no longer willing to offer an indicative purchase price of $188.00 per share/unit, and, on several occasions, indicated\nthat given the deterioration in the credit markets, any purchase price may need to be less than $180.00 per share/unit. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and\nEastdil subsequently informed Mr. Wilson of these discussions, who regularly updated Mr. Havner and Mr. Mitchell and the other members of the\nTransaction Committee regarding these discussions.\nOn March 18, 2022, at a meeting of the board of directors, Mr. Wilson provided an update on management\u2019s work with J.P. Morgan and Eastdil\nregarding the potential process to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company. Mr. Wilson described to the board of directors the various alternatives\nthat management and its advisors had identified, including the Company continuing to execute on its strategic plan and operating its business as a\nstandalone, public company, as well as potential transactions such as a merger, business combination, sale, spin-off, dissolution and distribution of\nassets. Mr. Wilson also discussed with the board of directors the macroeconomic and real estate environments in general, including the substantial\ndeterioration in the credit markets that had occurred since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, and the impact such deterioration would have on any\npotential purchaser of the Company or its real estate assets.\nOn March 25, 2022, Mr. Havner, a representative of Eastdil, and a representative of Blackstone met to discuss a variety of matters related to the real\nestate industry. At that meeting, Mr. Havner asked the representative of Blackstone whether Blackstone was still interested in pursuing an acquisition of\nthe Company and, if so, at what price. Blackstone\u2019s representative informed Mr. Havner that Blackstone was interested in an acquisition of the Company\nand that their respective representatives should continue discussions in a bilateral manner, without the Company engaging with third parties. Mr. Havner\ninformed Blackstone\u2019s representative that if the Company were to enter into bilateral negotiations with Blackstone regarding a transaction, he and the\nother members of the board of directors would insist on the right of the Company to solicit alternative proposals during a \u201cgo-shop\u201d period following the\nexecution of any definitive agreement with Blackstone.\nOn March 29, 2022, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Havner and representatives of Blackstone met via teleconference to further discuss Blackstone\u2019s potential\nacquisition of the Company. The representatives of Blackstone did not\n-37-\nTable of Contents\nmake a proposal during the discussion. Mr. Havner and representatives of Blackstone agreed that representatives of Blackstone would meet with Mr.\nWilson and additional representatives of the Company on March 31, 2022, during which meeting members of management would describe\nunderappreciated features of specific assets of the Company that the Company believed were likely undervalued in Blackstone\u2019s model, and thus not\naccurately reflected in any indicative purchase price.\nOn March 31, 2022, representatives of each of the Company, including Mr. Wilson, Blackstone, J.P. Morgan and Eastdil met via teleconference,\nduring which meeting members of management discussed the Company\u2019s portfolio of underappreciated assets, and answered questions from\nrepresentatives of Blackstone regarding the Company\u2019s assets, business strategy and financial outlook. At the conclusion of the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Blackstone indicated that they would provide an updated indicative purchase price shortly after the meeting.\nOn April 1, 2022, representatives of Blackstone, J.P. Morgan, and Eastdil continued to discuss the proposed transaction and the possible valuation\nof the Company. During this discussion, representatives of Blackstone indicated that they would be prepared to acquire all of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock and all outstanding common units of partnership interest of the Partnership not owned by the Company for $185.00 per share/unit in cash\n(the \u201cApril 1 Proposal\u201d). Thereafter on April 1, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil informed Mr. Wilson, Mr. Havner, and members of the\nTransaction Committee of the discussions with Blackstone, including the April 1 Proposal. Mr. Wilson, Mr. Havner, and the members of the Transaction\nCommittee agreed that they would discuss the April 1 Proposal at a meeting of the board of directors in order to determine a response.\nOn April 5, 2022, the board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives\nof J.P. Morgan, Eastdil, and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Wilson and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil provided members of the board of directors with\nan update on developments with respect to the strategic review, as well as discussions with Blackstone, including the April 1 Proposal. Additionally,\nrepresentatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil provided the board of directors with an update on the real estate market and macroeconomic conditions since\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the rapid deterioration of the credit markets, and the rising interest rate environment for borrowers.\nRepresentatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed with the board their preliminary financial analysis of the April 1 Proposal, including their analysis of\nBlackstone\u2019s overall financial ability to acquire the Company, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the board its legal obligations in\nconnection with considering the possible sale of the Company. Following this discussion, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of other\nstrategic alternatives that members of management and representatives of each of Eastdil and J.P. Morgan had discussed, including a potential separation\nof the Company\u2019s industrial-flex and office assets through the formation of a joint venture and/or taxable spin-off transaction. Members of the board of\ndirectors further discussed the April 1 Proposal and potential responses, including in the context of the Company\u2019s standalone plan, as well as potential\nshort- and long-term execution and strategic risks to the Company\u2019s long-range financial plan on a standalone basis, including the deteriorating credit\nmarkets and rising interest rate environment, as well as the execution risks associated with the strategic alternatives that J.P. Morgan and members of\nmanagement had identified. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also reviewed with the board other potential acquirors of the Company, including other\npublicly traded real estate investment trusts, as well as financial sponsor buyers other than Blackstone.\nFollowing this discussion, the board, management and advisors reviewed and discussed the risks to the Company and its business posed by\ncontacting other potential bidders before engaging in discussions with Blackstone, including: concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a\npotential transaction would disrupt the Company\u2019s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base\nand potential stock price volatility, and the limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of its size and\ndiverse portfolio of assets comprising multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex, and low-rise suburban office space (including as a result of the deterioration\nin credit markets and the rising interest rate environment). As a result, the board determined that it was in the best interest of the\n-38-\nTable of Contents\nCompany and its stockholders to pursue a transaction with Blackstone with a price per share/unit of at least $185.00 per share in cash, but that any\ndefinitive agreement with Blackstone must contain a \u201cgo-shop\u201d provision or other mechanism that would permit the Company to solicit and entertain\npotentially superior proposals from other bidders while having a binding contract with Blackstone. After further discussion of the best path forward to\nmaximizing value for the Company\u2019s stockholders, the board of directors instructed management and the Company\u2019s financial advisors to request that\nBlackstone revise the April 1 Proposal to improve its price per share/unit, and suggested that they make a counteroffer of $190.00 per share/unit in cash,\nand to inform Blackstone that the Company would require that any merger agreement include a go-shop provision.\nOn April 6, 2022, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil, acting at the direction of the board of directors, contacted a representative of\nBlackstone to inform him that the Company was prepared to move forward with bilateral negotiations with Blackstone for an acquisition by Blackstone of\nthe Company, but that to do so Blackstone would need to improve the price per share/unit of its April 1 Proposal, and suggested $190.00 as a price that\nthe board of directors might find acceptable. Additionally, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil, acting at the direction of the board of directors,\ninformed Blackstone\u2019s representative that any definitive agreement between the Company and Blackstone must include a go-shop provision.\nOn April 7, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Wilson to inform him that Blackstone would be making an offer to acquire the\nCompany for $187.50 per share/unit in cash. Thereafter, a representative of Blackstone emailed a letter to Mr. Wilson containing a non-binding proposal\n(the \u201cApril 7 Letter\u201d) for Blackstone to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at a value of $187.50 per share in cash. The April 7 Letter\nalso proposed that (i) the Company not be permitted to declare or pay any further dividends on its Common Stock prior to the closing of a transaction, (ii)\nthe Company\u2019s Preferred Stock (and the depositary shares representing an interest therein) would remain outstanding following the closing of the\nproposed transaction, and (iii) the merger agreement for any such transaction contain a customary no-shop provision. The April 7 Letter also stated that\nBlackstone\u2019s proposal was not subject to a financing condition. Mr. Wilson shared the April 7 Letter with the members of the board of directors, as well\nas the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors.\nOn April 8, 2022, following discussion with other members of the board of directors, including Mr. Havner and Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson contacted a\nrepresentative of Blackstone to inform him that he would be sending the Company\u2019s written response to the April 7 Letter, and that it would include a\npurchase price of $188.00 per share/unit in cash, as well as the right of the Company to continue paying its regular, quarterly dividends/distributions on\nthe Common Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership up to $1.05 per quarter, including pro rata dividends or distributions for\nany stub period prior to closing.\nFollowing this call on April 8, 2022, Mr. Wilson emailed a letter to Blackstone\u2019s representative containing the Company\u2019s response to the April 7\nLetter (the \u201cApril 8 Company Letter\u201d), which stated that the Company was prepared to proceed with a transaction with Blackstone, subject to alignment\non the following key terms: (i) a transaction price of $188.00 per share/unit in cash for all of the outstanding common equity of the Company and the\nPartnership, (ii) the right of the Company and the Partnership to continue paying their regular, quarterly dividends/distributions on the shares of Common\nStock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership of up to $1.05 per quarter, including pro rata dividends or distributions for any stub\nperiod prior to closing, (iii) a go-shop period of 45 days after signing the merger agreement, (iv) a termination fee equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the\ntransaction, payable by the Company to Blackstone in the event that the Company terminated its agreement with Blackstone to enter into a definitive\nagreement with a topping bidder, provided that such termination fee would be equal to 0.5% of the equity value of the transaction if the Company\nterminated its agreement with Blackstone to enter into an agreement with a bidder that emerged during the 45-day go-shop period, and (v) the Preferred\nStock (and depositary shares representing an interest therein) would remain outstanding following the closing. The April 8 Company Letter also stated\nthat, if Blackstone and the Company aligned on the foregoing terms, the Company was willing to forego the right to specifically enforce Blackstone\u2019s\nobligation to close the transaction, consistent with the approach Blackstone has taken in its other\n-39-\n-39-\nTable of Contents\nacquisitions of publicly traded real estate investment trusts, provided that Blackstone agree to pay a reverse termination fee equal to 12% of the equity\nvalue of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) in the event Blackstone breached its obligation to close\nthe transaction when otherwise obligated to do so. Finally, the letter stated that the Company expected that if Blackstone and the Company aligned on\nthese key terms, the parties could negotiate definitive documentation expeditiously.\nOn April 9, 2022, a representative of Blackstone contacted Mr. Wilson and stated that Blackstone had reviewed the April 8 Company Letter, and\nwas willing to agree to most of the key terms with certain modifications, which would be set forth in an updated proposal letter. In particular, Blackstone\u2019s\nrepresentative noted that Blackstone was unwilling to permit the Company and the Partnership to declare or pay any dividends on the shares of Common\nStock or common units of partnership interest of the Partnership for the second quarter of 2022 and was only willing to permit a pro-rata dividend or\ndistribution at a rate of $1.05 per quarter for the period from July 1, 2022 through the closing of a transaction.\nFollowing this discussion, on April 9, 2022, a representative of Blackstone emailed a proposal to Mr. Wilson containing Blackstone\u2019s response to\nthe April 8 Company Letter (the \u201cApril 9 Blackstone Proposal\u201d). In the April 9 Blackstone Proposal, Blackstone agreed to the terms of the April 8\nCompany Letter, including the price per share/unit of $188.00, with the following modifications: (i) the Company and the Partnership would not be\npermitted to declare and/or pay any dividends/distributions on the shares of Common Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership\nduring the second quarter of 2022 and would only have the ability to declare and/or pay a pro rata dividend/distribution at a rate of $1.05 per quarter for\nthe period from July 1, 2022 through the closing, (ii) the go-shop period would last for 30 days, instead of 45 days, (iii) the termination fee payable from\nthe Company to Blackstone in the event that the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal from another bidder would be\nequal to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock), provided that such termination\nfee would be equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) if, within 40 days\nof signing, the Company terminated its agreement with Blackstone and entered into an agreement with a bidder that made a proposal during the go-shop\nperiod that the board determined in good faith prior to the end of the go-shop period constituted or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior\nproposal, and (iv) the reverse termination fee payable by Blackstone to the Company in the event Blackstone breached its obligation to close the\ntransaction when otherwise obligated to do so would be 9% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the\nPreferred Stock). Mr. Wilson shared the April 9 Blackstone Proposal with certain members of the board of directors, as well as the Company\u2019s financial\nand legal advisors.\nLater on April 9, 2022, following discussion with certain other members of the board of directors, including Mr. Havner and Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson\ncontacted a representative of Blackstone and stated that the Company had reviewed the April 9 Blackstone Proposal, and that he believed the parties had\nreached agreement on most key terms, but that the Company was unwilling to forego the Company\u2019s and the Partnership\u2019s right to continue declaring and\npaying its regular, quarterly dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per quarter per share/unit, as well as pro rata dividends/distributions for any stub\nperiod prior to closing. Mr. Wilson informed Blackstone\u2019s representative that the Company\u2019s written response to the April 9 Blackstone Proposal would\nbe forthcoming.\nFollowing this call, on April 9, 2022, Mr. Wilson emailed a proposal to a representative of Blackstone containing the Company\u2019s response to the\nApril 9 Blackstone Proposal (the \u201cApril 9 Company Proposal\u201d). The April 9 Company Proposal agreed to the terms of the April 9 Blackstone Proposal\nwith certain modifications, including: (i) there would be no suspension of the Company\u2019s or the Partnership\u2019s right to declare and pay regular, quarterly\ndividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per share/unit, including a pro rata dividend or distribution for any stub period prior to closing, and (ii) the reverse\ntermination fee payable by Blackstone to the Company in the event Blackstone breached its obligation to close the transaction when otherwise obligated\nto do so would be 10% of the equity value of the transaction (including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock).\n-40-\nTable of Contents\nLater on April 9, 2022, a representative of Blackstone informed Mr. Wilson that Blackstone was willing to agree to the terms of the April 9 Company\nProposal, including the right of the Company and the Partnership to declare and pay regular, quarterly dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per\nshare/unit, including a pro rata dividend or distribution for any stub period prior to closing, but that the purchase price per share/unit must be $187.50 to\npartially account for the Company\u2019s right to continue to pay its regular, quarterly dividends/distributions of up to $1.05 per share/unit, including a pro\nrata dividend or distribution for any stub period prior to closing.\nFollowing receipt of Blackstone\u2019s revised proposal, on April 9, 2022, Mr. Wilson discussed Blackstone\u2019s proposal with certain other members of the\nboard of directors and the Company\u2019s legal and financial advisors. Following discussion, Mr. Wilson and such other members of the board of directors\ndetermined that, consistent with the board\u2019s prior determination on April 5, 2022, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to\nattempt to negotiate definitive documentation on terms consistent with those set forth in the April 9 Company Proposal, with a purchase price per\nshare/unit of $187.50. Mr. Wilson thereafter contacted Blackstone\u2019s representative to notify him that the Company was prepared to proceed on this basis.\nBeginning on April 10, 2022, the Company made available to Blackstone and its representatives certain additional due diligence information.\nThereafter, from April 10, 2022 through April 24, 2022, Blackstone, with the assistance of its advisors, continued to conduct due diligence on the\nCompany and its assets, including through calls with members of management.\nOn April 12, 2022, the board of directors held a meeting, which was attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management and representatives\nof J.P. Morgan, Eastdil and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Wilson and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil provided the board of directors with an update on\nthe negotiations with Blackstone since the board had authorized Mr. Wilson on April 5, 2022 to pursue a transaction with Blackstone at a price per\nshare/unit of at least $185.00. The group discussed that Blackstone had agreed to a price per share/unit of $187.50, as well as to the Company and the\nPartnership continuing to make regular, quarterly dividends/distributions in an amount of up to $1.05 per share/unit, including a pro rata\ndividend/distribution with respect to any stub period prior to closing. The group discussed that, given that the approval of the Company\u2019s common\nstockholders would be required in any such transaction, any transaction with Blackstone would be unlikely to close during the second quarter of 2022,\nand thus the right to pay a dividend during the second quarter of 2022 as well as a stub dividend for any stub period prior to closing would likely result in\ncommon stockholders receiving at least $1.05 that they would not otherwise receive if the Company were not permitted to declare and pay a dividend for\nthe second quarter of 2022. Additionally, the group discussed the fact that Blackstone had agreed that any definitive documentation with respect to a\ntransaction would provide the Company the right to solicit and entertain proposals from bidders other than Blackstone during a 30-day go-shop period.\nThe board instructed Mr. Wilson and members of the Company\u2019s senior management, along with the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors, to proceed\nto negotiate definitive documentation with Blackstone consistent with the terms described to the board at this meeting, which documentation would\nremain subject to final board approval.\nOn April 13, 2022, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, legal advisors to Blackstone, provided initial drafts to Wachtell Lipton of the proposed merger\nagreement and the other transaction documents. Between April 13, 2022 and April 24, 2022, the parties\u2019 respective management teams and legal and\nfinancial advisors engaged in extensive negotiations regarding the terms of the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documentation. During\nthe course of these negotiations, areas of discussion and negotiation between the parties included, among other things, the representations and\nwarranties to be made by the parties, the Company\u2019s obligations with respect to the operation of its business during the period between the signing of\nthe merger agreement and the consummation of the Mergers, the scope of the restrictions applicable to actions taken by the Company during the period\nbetween the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the Mergers, the conditions to completion of the Mergers, the plans of the\nsurviving company following the consummation of the Mergers with respect to the Preferred Stock and depositary shares in respect thereof, the\ntermination\n-41-\nTable of Contents\nprovisions and the triggers of the termination fee payable by the Company, and the provisions regarding the Company\u2019s equity awards, employee benefit\nplans, retention, severance and other compensation matters.\nOn April 18, 2022, a representative of a private equity firm (\u201cParty A\u201d) contacted Mr. Wilson and orally communicated an interest in acquiring the\nCompany. Mr. Wilson informed the representative of Party A that he would inform the board of such interest and inquired at what price would Party A be\nwilling to pursue such a transaction. The representative of Party A stated that Party A would need due diligence information regarding the Company, but\norally informed Mr. Wilson that the price could be up to as much as $200.00 per share/unit, subject to due diligence and obtaining necessary financing for\nsuch a transaction. Mr. Wilson asked the representative of Party A to present its proposal in writing. Thereafter, Mr. Wilson informed Mr. Mitchell, Mr.\nHavner, and the Company\u2019s financial and legal advisors of the discussion with Party A.\nOn April 24, 2022, the board of directors held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of the Company\u2019s senior management\nand representatives of J.P. Morgan, Eastdil, and Wachtell Lipton. During this meeting, members of the Company\u2019s senior management and its financial\nand legal advisors reviewed the history of negotiations with Blackstone and the terms of the proposal by Blackstone and the associated transaction\ndocuments. Mr. Wilson also informed the board of directors of his conversation with the representative of Party A, including the fact that Party A had not\npresented the Company with a written proposal at that time and that Party A had not conducted any non-public due diligence on the Company. Members\nof the Company\u2019s senior management and the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil discussed the likelihood of a third party offering to acquire the\nCompany at a value at or above $187.50 per share of Common Stock, including whether Party A would be able to secure the financing necessary to\nconsummate a transaction of this size, in light of the rapid deterioration of the credit markets following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the rising\ninterest rate environment for borrowers. The board also discussed the timing consideration relating to such possible proposals, as well as the potential\nopportunities and risks associated with rejecting Blackstone\u2019s proposal and remaining a standalone entity or pursuing other strategic alternatives or\ndiscussions with other third parties at that time, including concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the\nCompany\u2019s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price volatility.\nMembers of the board also discussed the Company\u2019s ability during a 30-day go-shop period following the execution of the merger agreement to solicit\nproposals from third parties, including Party A, and the ability of the Company to terminate its agreement with Blackstone to enter into an agreement with\nanother bidder, including Party A, if such a bidder made a superior proposal to acquire the Company. In addition, the board observed that the $110 million\ncompany termination fee applicable to qualified proposals made during the go-shop period was not likely to preclude or discourage other interested\nparties from submitting a superior proposal. Additionally, the board reviewed disclosures from J.P. Morgan regarding fees it had received or may in the\nfuture receive from the Company and its affiliates, Public Storage and its affiliates, or Blackstone and its affiliates, and J.P. Morgan\u2019s ownership of\ncommon equity of the Company, Public Storage, Blackstone, and their respective affiliates. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nfinancial analyses of the consideration provided for in the proposed merger agreement with Blackstone. Following its presentation, J.P. Morgan delivered\nto the Company\u2019s board of directors its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of such date and\nbased upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in\npreparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of our Common Stock in the Mergers was fair, from a financial point of view, to the\nholders of our Common Stock, as more fully described below in the section \u201c\u2014Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d. Also at the meeting,\nrepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a presentation summarizing the terms of the draft merger agreement and other transaction documents and\nreviewed with the directors their legal obligations in connection with their consideration and potential approval of the transaction with Blackstone.\nFollowing extensive discussion, the board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement, declared the Merger Agreement and the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Company Merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,\nand determined to recommend the\n-42-\nTable of Contents\napproval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to our stockholders.\nFollowing the board\u2019s approval, during the evening of April 24, 2022, the parties finalized and executed and delivered the Merger Agreement, the\nguaranty, and the equity commitment letter. As required by Blackstone, the parties and Public Storage, the Company\u2019s largest stockholder holding\napproximately 25.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and 20.9% of the issued and outstanding common units of partnership\ninterest of the Partnership, also executed the support agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Public Storage agreed to vote all of its shares of\nCommon Stock and common units of partnership interest of the Partnership in favor of the proposed transaction, not transfer its shares/units, and not\nengage in solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals to the extent the Company is prohibited from soliciting such proposals under the merger\nagreement with Blackstone. Thereafter, the transaction was announced before the opening of the financial markets in New York on April 25, 2022, in a\npress release jointly issued by the Company and Blackstone. The press release announcing the transaction also noted that the merger agreement\nincluded a 30-day go-shop period that would expire on May 25, 2022.\nDuring the go-shop period, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Eastdil, acting at the direction of the board of directors, communicated with 43\nprospective transaction partners in order to solicit such prospective transaction partners to make an offer or proposal that would constitute, or would\nreasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal. Of those 43 parties, the Company executed a confidentiality agreement with 12\nparties (including Party A) and subsequently provided non-public information with respect to the Company to such parties. To date, no party (including\nParty A) has made a Company Acquisition Proposal following the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nThe go-shop period expired at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on May 25, 2022.",

including the Company Merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, and recommend approval of\nthe Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to our stockholders, our board of directors consulted with the\nCompany\u2019s senior management team, as well as our financial and legal advisors, and considered a number of factors, including the following material\nfactors which the board of directors viewed as supporting its decision:\n\u2022\nthe current and historical trading prices of our shares of our Common Stock, and the fact that the merger consideration of $187.50 per share\nin cash represents a premium of approximately 12% to the closing price of our Common Stock as of April 22, 2022, the last trading day prior\nto the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 15% to the volume weighted average price of our\nCommon Stock over the 60 days prior to announcement of the proposed transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to continue declaring and paying its regular quarterly cash dividends on the Company\u2019s Common Stock and Preferred\nStock without a reduction in the merger consideration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company, including the Company\u2019s need to frequently raise capital due to\nthe capital intensive nature of the Company\u2019s business, the difficulty and cost of obtaining capital and the need to ensure qualified and\ntalented individuals are available to serve as members of the Company\u2019s management team\u037e\n\u2022\nthat a private company might be able to realize more value from the Company\u2019s business than a public company and thereby pay a higher\nprice to acquire the Company, including the ability of private companies to use higher leverage to pursue growth that is more accretive, to\nabsorb near-term dilution from capital expenditures in favor of longer-term growth, and to fund developments without having to rely on the\nvolatility of equity capital markets\u037e\n-43-Table of Contents\n\u2022\nthe board\u2019s belief that, in light of Blackstone\u2019s strategic focus on acquiring industrial real estate assets and substantial available capital,\nBlackstone was in the best position to offer the highest possible price for the Company\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration was the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations and that we negotiated an increase by Blackstone from its\nApril 1, 2022 proposed price of $185.00 per share, and the board of directors\u2019 belief that the merger consideration was the maximum price that\nBlackstone was willing to pay\u037e\n\u2022\nthe limited number of potential purchasers with the financial ability to acquire the Company in light of its size and diverse portfolio of assets\ncomprising multi-tenant industrial, industrial-flex, and low-rise suburban office space\u037e\n\u2022\nthe board\u2019s belief that contacting other potential bidders prior to signing a definitive agreement with Blackstone would result in significant\nrisks to the Company and its business, including concerns that market leaks and rumors regarding a potential transaction would disrupt the\nCompany\u2019s business relationships and risk employee turnover, as well as lead to turnover in our stockholder base and potential stock price\nvolatility\u037e\n\u2022\nthe board\u2019s belief that soliciting other potential buyers prior to signing a definitive agreement with

which the Company may actively solicit additional\nacquisition proposals from, and furnish information to and conduct negotiations with, third parties (including Party A), providing an\nopportunity to determine if a third party is willing to pay a higher value per share than Blackstone\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s right under the Merger Agreement, in response to unsolicited acquisition

circumstances, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing\nfor the implementation of a superior proposal, upon payment of a termination fee\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that in certain circumstances a lower termination fee of $110 million (representing approximately 1.5% of the Company\u2019s equity\nvalue, including the aggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) will be payable by the Company, and that the lower termination\nfee of $110 million and the termination fee of $220 million (representing approximately 3% of the Company\u2019s equity value, including the\naggregate liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock) were viewed by the board of directors, after consultation with our outside legal\ncounsel and financial advisors, as reasonable under the circumstances and not likely to preclude or discourage any other party (including\nParty A) from making a competing acquisition proposal, particularly with respect to those parties that make a qualifying proposal during the\ngo-shop period\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that the merger consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing our common stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity\nimmediately upon the closing of the Company Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties, and longer potential timeline for realizing\nequivalent value from the Company\u2019s standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives involving transactions in which all or a\nportion of the consideration would be payable in equity or involving portfolio

as the stated intention of members of the\nFederal Open Market Committee to continue to increase interest rates in 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties of remaining as an independent public company and being able to expand, or realize value from reducing, the size\nof the Company\u2019s portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions, and/or development, including, among other things, the challenges of\nacquiring assets on an accretive basis in light of the increasingly competitive environment for industrial real estate assets, and the difficulty\nand cost of obtaining capital to fund future activities due to the discount to estimated net asset value at which the Company\u2019s Common\nStock has recently traded\u037e\n\u2022\nthe belief that conditions for a sale transaction in the real estate market are generally favorable, with prices for industrial and industrial-flex\nassets being at or near historical highs while capitalization rates are at or near historical lows, and the likely possibility that interest rates\nmay continue to rise in the future, which may increase a buyer\u2019s financing costs resulting in less favorable conditions for sale transactions\nin the real

In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated\nby the Merger Agreement, including the\n-46-\nTable of Contents\nCompany Merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, and recommend approval of the Company Merger and\nthe other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to our stockholders, the board did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative\nweights to, and did not make specific assessments of, the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different\nfactors. The board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered, but determined that, in the aggregate,\nthe potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of approving the Company Merger, the Merger\nAgreement, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe above factors are not presented in any order of priority.

        "Section Text": "Forward-Looking Financial Information\nWhile the Company has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, the Company has not, as a matter of course, otherwise\npublicly disclosed internal projections as to future performance, earnings, or other results beyond the then current annual period and is especially wary\nof making projections for extended periods due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future\nperiods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the Company is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain\nunaudited prospective financial information of the Company on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the Mergers (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d), to\ngive the Company\u2019s common stockholders access to the financial projections that were made available to our board of directors and J.P. Morgan in\nconnection with their consideration and evaluation of the Company Merger. The Company Projections were provided to J.P Morgan for its use and\nreliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by J.P. Morgan to our board of directors and J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion as discussed in \u201c\u2014\nOpinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d, and such use and reliance was approved by our board of directors. The Company did not provide the\nCompany Projections to Blackstone, but did provide certain property-level projected financial information to Blackstone in connection with Blackstone\u2019s\ndue diligence review of the Company\u2019s properties. The Company advised the recipients of the Company Projections that its internal financial forecasts\nare subjective in many respects. The inclusion of the Company Projections or of this summary does not constitute an admission or representation by the\nCompany, J.P. Morgan, or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as an indication that our board of directors, J.P.\nMorgan, the Company or its management, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the\nachievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and should\nnot be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company\nProjections.\nThe Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were based are subjective in many respects and\nsubject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of the Company\u2019s industry and based on actual experience and\nbusiness developments. The Company\n-47-Table of Contents\nProjections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Company performance, industry performance,\ngeneral business, economic, regulatory, market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant\neconomic and competitive uncertainties, and beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company Projections constitute forward-looking information and are\nsubject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cCautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate and for\nactual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company Projections will be realized or\nthat actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected, and the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future\noperating results and should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes\nless reliable with each successive year. The Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which\nthey were prepared, including the Mergers, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the Company\nProjections may have changed since the date the Company Projections were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly,\nwhich adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be achieved.\nIn addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Company Projections\nwere prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of the Company, Blackstone or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each\nof them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances\nexisting after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in\nerror (except, in the case of the Company, as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the\nCompany Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.\nFor the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the Company Projections were prepared, as\nwell as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the\nCompany Projections set forth below. The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and\nother information contained in the Company\u2019s public filings with the SEC. The Company urges all of its stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings\nfor a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d\nThe Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with United States\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cErnst & Young\u201d), the Company\u2019s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to the\nCompany Projections and, accordingly, neither Ernst & Young nor any other accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with\nrespect thereto. The Ernst & Young report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to the Company\u2019s historical financial information. It\ndoes not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.\nThe Company has not made and makes no representation to any stockholder of the Company or to Parent, Merger Sub I, or Merger Sub II in the\nMerger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company Projections or regarding the Company\u2019s ultimate performance compared to the information\ncontained in the Company Projections or that the projected results will be achieved. None of the Company, Blackstone or any of our or their respective\naffiliates assumes any responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy, or completeness of the Company Projections.\n-48-\nTable of Contents\nCompany Projections\nThe Company\u2019s management prepared the Company Projections with respect to the Company\u2019s business, as a standalone company, for the fiscal\nyears ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2026, except that unlevered free cash flow was calculated by J.P. Morgan using the cash net\noperating income and adjusted EBITDA projected by the Company\u2019s management.\nThe following is a summary of the Company Projections, with dollars in millions:\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\n2026E\nCash Net Operating Income (NOI)(1)\n$\n300\n$\n325\n$\n358\n$\n380\n$\n404\nAdj.

Morgan\u2019s financial analyses and opinion as discussed in \u201c\u2014Opinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\u201d, the\nCompany\u2019s management provided J.P. Morgan two separate allocations of the Company\u2019s projected cash net operating income for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2022. The first allocation was done on an \u2018As reported\u2019 basis (Industrial, Office, Flex and Multifamily) in order to match the Company\u2019s\npublic reporting of cash net operating income by property type. The second allocation was done on an \u2018Asset type\u2019 basis (using Industrial, Office and\nMultifamily classifications only), where various adjustments were made to the \u2018As-reported\u2019 allocations in order to take into account the actual Office\nusage in each property, as provided by the Company. For this second allocation, the Company\u2019s reported \u2018Industrial\u2019 cash net operating income was\npartly allocated as \u2018Office\u2019 to reflect the estimated office build-out of the Company\u2019s industrial classified assets. Additionally, for the Company\u2019s reported\n\u2018Flex\u2019 segment, the cash net operating income was reallocated to \u2018Industrial\u2019 and \u2018Office\u2019 based on the estimated build-out of industrial and office square\nfootage across the Company\u2019s Flex portfolio. The final allocations are as follows, with dollars in millions:\n2022E\nNOI(1)\nAs Reported Classification\nIndustrial\n$ 207\nFlex\n$\n60\nOffice\n$\n28\nMultifamily\n$\n5\nAsset Type Classification(2)\nIndustrial\n$ 198\nOffice\n$\n96\nMultifamily\n$\n5\n(1)\nCash Net Operating Income is defined as rental income less amortized amounts of deferred rent receivables (net of write-offs), in-place lease\nintangibles, tenant improvement reimbursements, lease incentives and expenses related to stock-based compensation.\n-49-\nTable of Contents\n(2)\nThe allocation by Asset Type takes into account the actual Office usage in each property, and excludes the Flex classification.\nCash Net Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the\napplicable rules and regulations of the SEC, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other\ncompanies. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. SEC rules that may otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure\ndo not apply to non-GAAP financial measures provided to directors or a financial advisor (like the Company Projections) in connection with a proposed\ntransaction like the Mergers when the disclosure is included in a document like this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by J.P. Morgan for purposes of its opinion or by our board of directors in connection with its\nconsideration of the Company Merger. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the\nCompany Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on the Company of the Mergers and do not attempt to\npredict or suggest future results following the Mergers. The Company Projections do not give effect to the Mergers, including the impact of negotiating\nor executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the Mergers, the effect on the Company of any\nbusiness or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the Merger Agreement having been executed, or the effect of any\nbusiness or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed, but that were instead\naltered, accelerated, postponed, or not taken in anticipation of the Mergers. Further, the Company Projections do not take into account the effect on the\nCompany of any possible failure of the Mergers to occur.\nOpinion of the Company\u2019s Financial Advisor\nPursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by\nthe Merger Agreement, including the Mergers.\nAt the meeting of the board of directors of the Company on April 24, 2022, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the board of directors of the\nCompany that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the\nreview undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the Mergers\nwas fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its April 24, 2022 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to\nthe board of directors of the Company, dated April 24, 2022, that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common\nStock in the Mergers was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated April 24, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures\nfollowed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Exhibit C to this proxy\nstatement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company\u2019s common stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan\u2019s\nopinion was addressed to the Company\u2019s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the\nMergers, was directed only to the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the Mergers and did not address any other\naspect of the Mergers. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Mergers to the\nholders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or\n-50-\nTable of Contents\nthe Partnership or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Mergers. The issuance of J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was approved by a\nfairness committee of J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any of the Company\u2019s common stockholders as to\nhow such stockholder should vote with respect to the Mergers or any other matter.\nIn arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:\n\u2022\nreviewed a draft dated April 24, 2022 of the Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates\u037e\n\u2022\nreviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business\u037e and\n\u2022\nperformed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the\npurposes of its opinion.\nIn addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Mergers,\nand the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain\nother matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.\nIn giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was\nfurnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any\nsuch information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to\nundertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities,\nnor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.\nIn relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared\nbased on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company\u2019s management as to the expected future results of\noperations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or\nforecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the\nMerger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made\nby the Company and Parent in the Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis.\nJ.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P.\nMorgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Mergers will\nbe obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Mergers.\nThe Company Projections furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by the Company\u2019s management, as discussed more fully under the section\nentitled \u201c\u2014Forward Looking Financial Information\u201d. While the Company has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, the\nCompany does not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclose internal projections beyond the then current annual period, including of the type\nprovided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis of the Mergers, and such Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of,\nor with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with GAAP, published guidelines of the SEC, or the guidelines established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The Company Projections reflect\nnumerous assumptions, many of which are difficult to predict, and may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, factors related to\ngeneral economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the\n-51-\nTable of Contents\nCompany Projections. For more information regarding the use of the Company Projections and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the\nsection entitled \u201c\u2014Forward Looking Financial Information\u201d.\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.\nMorgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion, and that J.P.\nMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of\nview, to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the Mergers, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Mergers to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other\nconstituencies of the Company or the Partnership or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Mergers. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan\nexpressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Mergers, or\nany class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the Mergers or with respect to the\nfairness of any such compensation.\nJ.P. Morgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of\nthe Company or any other alternative transaction prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, were determined\nthrough arm\u2019s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the\nCompany\u2019s board of directors. J.P. Morgan\u2019s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company\u2019s board of\ndirectors in its evaluation of the Mergers and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company\u2019s board of directors or management\nwith respect to the Mergers or the consideration, including the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nIn accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its\nopinion to the Company\u2019s board of directors on April 24, 2022 and in the financial analyses presented to the Company\u2019s board of directors on such date\nin connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with\nrendering its opinion to the Company\u2019s board of directors and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P.\nMorgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and\nin order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary.\nConsidering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and\nassumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses.\nImplied Capitalization Rate Valuation Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a sum-of-the-parts implied capitalization rate valuation analysis of\nthe Company, based on the projected cash net operating income of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022 (\u201c2022E NOI\u201d) allocated, at the\ndirection of the Company\u2019s management, to the following asset types of the Company: Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties. Using publicly\navailable information, J.P. Morgan compared the selected financial data of the Company with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged\nin businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged in by the Company.\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan with respect to the Company\u2019s Industrial properties were as follows:\n\u2022\nPrologis, Inc.\n\u2022\nDuke Realty Corp.\n-52-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc.\n\u2022\nFirst Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.\n\u2022\nEastGroup Properties, Inc.\n\u2022\nTerreno Realty Corporation\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan with respect to the Company\u2019s Office properties were as follows:\n\u2022\nHighwoods Properties, Inc.\n\u2022\nPiedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.\nThe companies selected by J.P. Morgan with respect to the Company\u2019s Multifamily properties were as follows:\n\u2022\nWashington Real Estate Investment Trust\n\u2022\nApartment Income REIT Corp.\n\u2022\nCamden Property Trust\n\u2022\nUDR, Inc.\nThese companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for the\npurposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics\nthat are materially different from those of the Company. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences\nin financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they\nwould affect the Company.\nUsing publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company with respect to the Company\u2019s Industrial, Office and\nMultifamily properties, the ratio of the consensus equity research analyst estimates for such company\u2019s cash net operating income for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2022 to consensus equity research analyst estimates for such company\u2019s implied real estate value (the \u201cImplied Capitalization Rate\u201d).\nBased on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected the following ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates for the Company\u2019s Industrial, Office\nand Multifamily properties:\nImplied\nCapitalization\nRates\nIndustrial\n3.4\n% -\n4.0%\nOffice\n7.0\n% -\n7.9%\nMultifamily\n4.0\n% -\n4.7%\nJ.P. Morgan then calculated ranges of implied equity values for the Company\u2019s Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties by applying the\napplicable ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates to the 2022E NOI allocated, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, to the Company\u2019s Industrial,\nOffice and Multifamily properties.\n-53-\nTable of Contents\nAfter aggregating the ranges of implied equity value for the Company\u2019s Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties, this analysis indicated the\nfollowing range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company\u2019s Common Stock:\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue\nLow\nHigh\nImplied Capitalization Rate Valuation Analysis (Asset Type)\n$168\n$198\nThe range of implied per share equity values for the Company\u2019s Common Stock was compared to (i) the closing price of the Company\u2019s Common\nStock of $167.67 as of April 22, 2022, the trading day immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion dated April 24, 2022, and (ii) the offer\nprice of $187.50 per share of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nJ.P. Morgan also conducted a sum-of-the-parts implied capitalization rate valuation analysis of the Company, based on the 2022E NOI of the\nCompany allocated, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, based on the Company\u2019s following \u2018as reported\u2019 segments: Industrial, Flex, Office and\nMultifamily.\nUsing the information and calculated ranges listed above for the Company\u2019s Industrial, Office and Multifamily properties and, in the case of the\nFlex segment, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, using the weighted average of the Industrial and Office Implied Capitalization Rates, which\nwas calculated by applying a 41% weighting to the Industrial Implied Capitalization Rates and a 59% weighting to the Office Implied Capitalization Rate,\nJ.P. Morgan selected the following ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates for the Industrial, Flex, Office and Multifamily segments based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience:\nImplied\nCapitalization\nRates\nIndustrial\n3.4\n% -\n4.0%\nFlex\n5.5\n% -\n6.3%\nOffice\n7.0\n% -\n7.9%\nMultifamily\n4.0\n% -\n4.7%\nJ.P. Morgan then calculated ranges of implied equity values for the Company\u2019s Industrial, Flex, Office and Multifamily segments by applying the\napplicable ranges of Implied Capitalization Rates to the 2022E NOI allocated, at the direction of the Company\u2019s management, to the Company\u2019s Industrial,\nFlex, Office and Multifamily segments.\nAfter aggregating the ranges of implied equity value for the Company\u2019s Industrial, Flex, Office and Multifamily segments, this analysis indicated\nthe following range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $1.00) for the Company\u2019s Common Stock:\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue\nLow\nHigh\nImplied Capitalization Rate Valuation Analysis (\u2018As\nReported\u2019 Segments)\n$177\n$208\nThe range of implied per share equity values for the Company\u2019s Common Stock was compared to (i) the closing price of the Company\u2019s Common\nStock of $167.67 as of April 22, 2022, the trading day immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion dated April 24, 2022, and (ii) the offer\nprice of $187.50 per share of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\n-54-\nTable of Contents\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value\nper share for the Company\u2019s Common Stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate during fiscal\nyears 2022E through 2026E based upon the Company Projections prepared by the Company\u2019s management (as set forth in the section entitled \u201c\u2014\nForward Looking Financial Information\u201d, which was discussed with, and approved by, the Company\u2019s board of directors for use by J.P. Morgan in\nconnection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of this period by applying\nperpetual growth rates ranging from 2.75% to 3.25%, based on guidance provided by the Company\u2019s management, to estimates of the projected cash net\noperating income for the Company at the end of fiscal-year 2026E, as provided in the Company Projections. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered\nfree cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values to present value as of December 31, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 7.00% to 7.50%,\nwhich ranges were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the\nunlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and other adjustments for the Company\nas of April 12, 2022.\nBased on the foregoing, this analysis indicated the following range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the\nCompany\u2019s Common Stock:\nImplied Per Share Equity\nValue\nLow\nHigh\nDiscounted Cash Flow\n$159\n$202\nThe range of implied per share equity values for the Company\u2019s Common Stock was compared to (i) the closing price of the Company\u2019s Common\nStock of $167.67 as of April 22, 2022, the trading day immediately preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written opinion dated April 24, 2022, and (ii) the offer\nprice of $187.50 per share of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nMiscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data\npresented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing\nsummary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the\nanalyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were\nmerely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value\nof the Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving\nat its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether\nany individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered\nthe totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.\nAnalyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of\nthe parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,\nwhich may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan\u2019s analyses are not and do not purport to be\nappraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as\ndescribed in the above summary is identical to the Company. However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies\nwith operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. The analyses\nnecessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved\nand other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company.\n-55-\nTable of Contents\nAs a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their\nsecurities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions\nof listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company\nwith respect to the Mergers and deliver an opinion to the Company\u2019s board of directors with respect to the Mergers on the basis of, among other things,\nsuch experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it\noperates.\nFor financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Mergers, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of up to\n$32.0 million, $3.0 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent\nand payable upon the consummation of the Mergers. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable and documented\nout-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with its services, including the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of outside\ncounsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan\u2019s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company and certain affiliates\nof Parent, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as\njoint lead arranger on the Company\u2019s syndicated credit facility in August 2021, sole lead arranger on Blackstone\u2019s, an affiliate of Parent, syndicated credit\nfacility in November 2021, joint lead bookrunner on Blackstone\u2019s offering of debt securities in September 2021, and joint lead bookrunner on Blackstone\u2019s\noffering of equity securities in November 2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan\u2019s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding\ncredit facilities of Blackstone, for which it receives customary compensation. In addition, during the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan\u2019s written\nopinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Blackstone\u2019s portfolio companies for which J.P.\nMorgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included providing debt syndication, equity\nunderwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Blackstone\u2019s portfolio companies. During the two years preceding the date of J.P.\nMorgan\u2019s written opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Public Storage, which owns\napproximately 26% (or 7.2 million shares) of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and would own approximately 41.4% (or 14.5 million shares) of the\noutstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock if it redeemed its common units of partnership interest of the Partnership for the Company\u2019s\nCommon Stock, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting\nas active bookrunner on an offering of Public Storage\u2019s debt securities in November 2021, joint bookrunning manager on an offering of Public Storage\u2019s\ndebt securities in April 2021, and active bookrunner on an offering of Public Storage\u2019s debt securities in January 2021. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its\naffiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company, Blackstone, and Public Storage. During the\ntwo-year period preceding delivery of its written opinion ending on April 24, 2022, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan (i) from Parent and its\naffiliates and their portfolio companies were approximately $242 million and (ii) from Public Storage were approximately $7 million. During the two-year\nperiod preceding delivery of its written opinion ending on April 24, 2022, J.P. Morgan did not recognize any fees from the Company. In the ordinary\ncourse of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives,\nbank loans or other obligations) of the Company, Blackstone or Public Storage for their own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly,\nthey may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments. The information regarding fees recognized by J.P.\nMorgan disclosed in this paragraph is based upon information provided to us by J.P. Morgan.\nFinancing\nIn connection with the closing of the Mergers, Parent will cause an aggregate of approximately $6.6 billion to be paid to the holders of our Common\nStock, including the holders of Company equity awards, and the holders\n-56-\nTable of Contents\nof common units of partnership interest of the Partnership. In addition, Parent has informed us that in connection with the closing of the Mergers, Parent\nexpects to cause our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, if any, to be prepaid in full. As of May 19, 2022, we had $0 in aggregate\nprincipal amount of consolidated indebtedness under our revolving credit facility.\nParent has informed us that it has received, in connection with the Mergers, a debt commitment letter from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Bank of\nAmerica, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Societe Generale Financial Corporation, providing\nfor debt financing through a CMBS loan and balance sheet loan in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $4.85 billion to be funded on or after the\nclosing of the Mergers, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in the debt commitment letter (which we refer to collectively as the \u201cdebt\nfinancing\u201d) and that it may seek to obtain additional debt financing in connection with the Mergers. In addition, it is expected that the Sponsor and its\naffiliates will contribute equity to Parent for the purpose of funding the acquisition costs (including the merger consideration) that are not covered by\nsuch debt financing.\nParent has informed us that in addition to the payment of the merger consideration, the funds to be obtained from the debt and equity financing\nmay be used for purposes such as reserves, paying carrying costs with respect to the properties, funding working capital requirements, and for other\ncosts and expenses related to the financing and the Mergers. Parent has informed us that it currently believes that the funds to be borrowed under the\ndebt financing would be secured by, among other things, a mortgage lien on certain properties which are wholly owned and/or ground leased by us,\ncertain escrows and reserves and such other pledges and security required by the lenders to secure and perfect their interests in the applicable collateral,\nand that such debt financing would be conditioned on the mergers being completed and other customary conditions for similar financings.\nThe Merger Agreement does not contain a financing condition or a \u201cmarket MAC\u201d condition to the closing of the mergers. For more information,\nsee \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014 Financing Cooperation\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement \u2014 Conditions to the Mergers.\u201d\nInterests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Company Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Company Merger, holders of our\nCommon Stock should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Company Merger that may be different from, or in addition\nto, the interests of holders of our Common Stock generally. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other\nmatters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Company Merger), and in recommending that the common stockholders vote in favor\nof the proposal to approve the Company Merger. These interests are described below. The Company Merger will be a \u201cchange in control\u201d (or term of\nsimilar import) for purposes of our executive compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.\nOur executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are Stephen W. Wilson (President and Chief\nExecutive Officer), Adeel Khan (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and Trenton A. Groves (Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting\nOfficer). Our executive officer who is not a named executive officer for purposes of the discussion below is Maria R. Hawthorne (Interim Chief Operating\nOfficer).\nThe information in this section and the tables below do not include information for Dan M.

Each Company Option with a per share exercise price that exceeds the merger\nconsideration will be cancelled for no consideration.\n\u2022\nEach Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a\ncash payment in an amount equal to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the\nCompany Merger Effective Time multiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\u2022\nEach Company Deferred Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will become vested\nand, at the Company Merger Effective Time, be converted into a right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to (1) the number of\nshares of Common Stock subject to the Company Deferred Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time\nmultiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.\n\u2022\nEach 2022 EIP Award will be cancelled in exchange for a specified cash payment, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection\nwith the Company Merger\u201d for an estimate of the value of each of our named executive officer\u2019s unvested equity-based awards. In addition to the awards\nthat are outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement, the Company will also grant a 2022 EIP Award with a value of $3.4 million to Mr. Wilson in\nrecognition of his transition from interim to permanent Chief Executive Officer after the date that 2022 EIP Awards were granted to other executives of the\nCompany.

Each cash long-term incentive award will vest ratably over five years\n(consistent with the vesting schedule applicable to annual grants of Company Options) subject to the director\u2019s continued service on our board of\ndirectors, and will accelerate and vest in full at the Company Merger Effective Time.\nSeverance Letter Agreements with Certain Executive Officers\nPrior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company will enter into a letter agreement with each of Ms. Hawthorne and Messrs.

Each letter agreement\nwill provide that the applicable executive officer\u2019s employment will be terminated without cause effective as of the closing date (or, if requested by Parent,\nas of a date that is not later than 30 days after the closing date) and that the severance payments are subject to such executive officer signing and not\nrevoking a release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates.\nTransaction Success Bonus Program\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may adopt a transaction success bonus program in an aggregate amount of up to $2.5 million to\npromote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the completion of the Company Merger. Awards under the transaction success bonus\nprogram will be allocated among employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than Messrs.

Each transaction success bonus award will vest in full at the Company\nMerger Effective Time, subject to the participant\u2019s continued employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries through the Company Merger\nEffective Time. As of the date of this proxy statement, no transaction success bonus awards have been granted to any of our executive officers.\n2022 Short-Term Cash Incentive Payments\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may pay to each of our employees who is eligible to receive a short-term cash incentive payment in\nrespect of 2022 (we refer to each as a \u201c2022 Cash Incentive\u201d), including each of our executive officers other than Mr. Wilson and Ms. Hawthorne, a cash\npayment that does not exceed the product of (a) such employee\u2019s total target 2022 Cash Incentive, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is\nthe number of days elapsed between January 1, 2022 and the closing date and the denominator of which is 365.\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection\nwith the Company Merger\u201d for the estimated maximum amount of the 2022 Cash Incentive payment that may be paid to each of our eligible named\nexecutive officers under the terms of the Merger Agreement.\n-59-\nTable of Contents\nGross-Up Agreements\nAs previously disclosed, on April 24, 2022, our board of directors approved excise tax gross-up agreements with each of Messrs. Wilson and Khan.\nThe agreements provide each executive officer with the right to receive a gross-up payment in the event that any payments or benefits provided to such\nexecutive officer in connection with the Company Merger becomes subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The\ngross-up payment would generally place each executive officer in the same after-tax position that he would have been in if the excise tax did not apply to\nhim, and does not cover ordinary income taxes due on the payments and benefits giving rise to the excise tax. These gross-up rights are provided solely\nin connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and therefore the gross-up agreements will be automatically revoked if the\nMerger Agreement is terminated without the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to our Named Executive Officers in Connection\nwith the Company Merger\u201d for the estimated amounts of the payments that each of Messrs.
