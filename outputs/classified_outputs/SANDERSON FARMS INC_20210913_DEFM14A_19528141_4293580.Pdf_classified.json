        "Section Header": "Background of the Merger",
        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nAs part of Sanderson Farms\u2019 ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term strategic goals and plans, the Board of Directors and\nSanderson Farms\u2019 senior management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, periodically review, consider and assess Sanderson Farms\u2019\noperations and financial performance and overall industry conditions, as well as the Company\u2019s succession plan, as they may affect those strategic goals\nand plans. This review includes, among other matters, the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other\nfinancial and strategic alternatives, including a potential expansion of its footprint through the construction of one or more new poultry complexes. The\nBoard of Directors has also regularly engaged with Sanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders to discuss and solicit their perspectives on its strategic and financial\ndirection. In these discussions, Sanderson Farms consulted with Centerview, a long-standing financial advisor to Sanderson Farms, in connection with\nvarious strategic and corporate finance matters, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), Fishman Haygood LLP (\u201cFishman Haygood\u201d)\nand Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC (\u201cBrunini\u201d), its legal advisors (the \u201clegal advisors\u201d).\nBeginning in September 2019, the Board of Directors determined to pursue a process to explore a potential strategic transaction, which process was\nput on hold in early 2020 due to challenges in poultry markets and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn September 1, 2020, Sanderson Farms received an unsolicited proposal from Durational Capital Management (\u201cDurational\u201d) to acquire Sanderson\nFarms for $142 per share in cash. Durational stated in its letter that it had recently acquired a large position in Sanderson Farms\u2019 common stock. On\nSeptember 13, 2020, the Board of Directors, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Durational proposal\nsignificantly undervalued Sanderson Farms and its future prospects, and that the highly conditional and opportunistic proposal was not in the best\ninterests of Sanderson Farms or its stockholders. Sanderson Farms sent a letter to Durational on September 14, 2020, informing Durational of the Board of\nDirectors\u2019 determination. Several weeks later, on October 29, 2020, Sanderson Farms was contacted by several news outlets asking Sanderson Farms\nwhether it could confirm that it had received an unsolicited proposal from Tyson Foods, Inc. (\u201cTyson Foods\u201d) and Durational. In response, Sanderson\nFarms determined to issue a statement the same day stating that it had received an unsolicited proposal from Durational, and not from Tyson Foods, and\nthat the Board of Directors had determined that the Durational proposal significantly undervalued Sanderson Farms and its future prospects, and that the\nhighly conditional and opportunistic proposal was not in the best interests of Sanderson Farms or its stockholders.\n-29-Table of Contents\nThroughout most of 2020 and the early months of 2021, Sanderson Farms and the Board of Directors remained focused on supporting Sanderson\nFarms and its employees, growers and other independent contractors through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to health and\nsafety issues as well as potential supply chain issues, as well as the impact from higher feed prices. Early 2021 brought with it optimism as to the rebound\nof the poultry markets for the rest of 2021, largely due to higher market prices for certain of Sanderson Farms products. The higher prices reflected\nincreased demand fueled in part by more customers preparing meals at home during the pandemic and the \u201cchicken sandwich wars\u201d among various quick\nserve food service customers. Further, as vaccines against Covid-19 became more readily available, Sanderson Farms believed that demand from food\nservice customers, which had already begun to recover, would continue to rise as diners became more comfortable eating in-restaurant. In early spring\n2021, the Board of Directors and members of management began discussing a potential sale of Sanderson Farms and other alternatives in light of these\nfavorable broader poultry industry trends, as well as Sanderson Farms\u2019 overall strategic plan and competitive position.\nSubsequently, at a virtual meeting held on March 30, 2021, the Board of Directors discussed and reviewed, together with Centerview and its legal\nadvisors, Sanderson Farms\u2019 business and strategic plan and a range of strategic alternatives potentially available to Sanderson Farms. Representatives of\nCenterview discussed a range of potential strategic alternatives based on management\u2019s long-term forecasts, including continuing to execute on its\nstandalone plan, conducting various capital allocation or capital return alternatives, including potential share repurchases or regular or special dividends,\nan acquisition or series of acquisitions, a separation of its Foods division, a potential sale of Sanderson Farms, and considerations associated with each\nalternative. Members of management also presented an updated version of the Sanderson Farms\u2019 five-year financial forecast model to the Board of\nDirectors and discussed key assumptions underlying such model. Representatives of Centerview also provided the Board of Directors with an overview\nof a potential process for the sale of Sanderson Farms, including illustrative timelines and stages for such process and potential counterparties that might\nbe interested in such a transaction. These potential counterparties were selected based on strategic fit, financial and administrative capacity to\nconsummate a potential transaction, likelihood of completion (including as it related to receipt of any required regulatory approvals), as well as capacity\nto efficiently assess interest in a potential transaction. The Board of Directors, together with management and representatives of Centerview, discussed\nthe list of potential counterparties and various considerations associated with reaching out to, and pursuing a strategic transaction with, such parties.\nAfter discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors determined to explore more intensively a potential sale of Sanderson Farms, authorized\nrepresentatives of Centerview to contact certain of these potential counterparties to ascertain their interest in a strategic transaction involving Sanderson\nFarms, and authorized the legal advisors, working with management, to negotiate and execute non-disclosure agreements with potential counterparties.\nCommencing on April 12, 2021, representatives of Centerview began contacting the potential counterparties regarding a potential strategic\ntransaction. Representatives of Centerview contacted twelve potential counterparties that the Board of Directors had authorized Centerview to contact at\nthe meeting of the Board of Directors held on March 30, 2021. Seven of the twelve potential counterparties (including each of CGC and Cargill) entered\ninto non-disclosure agreements with Sanderson Farms and were provided with preliminary due diligence materials. All seven of the non-disclosure\nagreements included standstill provisions, and none of the standstill provisions remain in effect.\nOn April 21 and 22, 2021, representatives of CGC and Cargill contacted Centerview and requested permission to partner with one another and\nsubmit a joint bid (collectively, the \u201cBidder Group\u201d), as required under their respective non-disclosure agreements, which approval was granted by\nSanderson Farms\u2019 management, based on its belief that such partnering would create more actionable bids and enhance value.\nOn May 4, 2021, representatives of Centerview sent a process letter to each of the seven counterparties that had entered into non-disclosure\nagreements with Sanderson Farms, requesting preliminary indications of interest by May 19, 2021.\nOn May 19, 2021, two potential counterparties submitted preliminary indications of interest to acquire Sanderson Farms for cash: the Bidder Group,\nwhich indicated a price of $200.00 per share\u037e and a second bidder\n-30-\nTable of Contents\n(\u201cBidder 2\u201d), which indicated a price range of $200.00 to $206.00 per share. The Bidder Group contemplated effectuating the potential transaction through\nthe acquisition of Sanderson Farms by an entity jointly owned by each of CGC and Cargill, into which CGC would contribute its ownership interests in\nWayne Farms and Cargill would contribute cash equity. The remaining four potential counterparties that had executed non-disclosure agreements with\nSanderson Farms did not provide preliminary indications of interest to acquire Sanderson Farms, indicating to representatives of Centerview that they\nwere withdrawing from the process for a range of reasons, including the fact that they were interested in certain portions and not the whole of Sanderson\nFarms\u2019 business or assets, that they were concerned with the certainty of completion of the strategic combination, that a potential acquisition would be\ntoo large for them to finance, or that they were focused on other strategic priorities.\nAt a virtual meeting held on May 24, 2021, the Board of Directors discussed and reviewed, together with Centerview and its legal advisors, the\npreliminary indications of interest received from the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, and other alternatives including continuing to operate Sanderson Farms\non a stand-alone basis. Representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton discussed and reviewed with the Board of Directors these various potential\nstrategic alternatives, and summarized the terms and conditions of the indications of interest, discussing with the Board of Directors the key assumptions\nunderlying the indicative valuations included in the preliminary indications of interest, proposed financing plans, timing and required internal and external\napprovals, as well as diligence requests made by the potential counterparties. Representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton also provided the\nBoard of Directors with a comprehensive outline for the next stages of the strategic process leading up to the announcement of a potential transaction\nwith either of the potential counterparties, including the scheduling of management presentations and site visits, as well as the preparation and\nnegotiation of definitive agreements with respect to such a transaction. Following discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors authorized\nSanderson Farms\u2019 advisors, working with management, to proceed with the Sanderson Farms\u2019 process to explore the sale of itself, permit each of the\nBidder Group and Bidder 2 with access to additional diligence on Sanderson Farms, and to schedule management presentations and site visits with\nrepresentatives of each of the Bidder Group and Bidder 2.\nOn June 2, 2021, representatives of Centerview received an inbound inquiry from a financial advisor representing an industry participant who had\nnot previously been contacted by Centerview as part of this strategic process (\u201cBidder 3\u201d). Bidder 3 thereafter entered into a non-disclosure agreement\nwith Sanderson Farms which included a standstill provision which no longer remains in effect. On June 8, 2021, Bidder 3 withdrew from the process\nbecause of concerns regarding financing a potential acquisition on the proposed timeline.\nOn June 4, 2021, Sanderson Farms provided representatives of the Bidder Group and Bidder 2 with access to the virtual data room.\nBetween June 9 and June 11, 2021, the Bidder Group and its representatives and Bidder 2 and its representatives, including a potential equity\nfinancing source for Bidder 2, participated in separate full-day management meetings and diligence sessions hosted by Sanderson Farms in New York,\nNew York and supervised by Centerview and Wachtell Lipton. Each meeting was preceded by dinner with the presentation\u2019s participants, together with\nrepresentatives of Centerview, the prior evening. Following these meetings, members of management and Sanderson Farms\u2019 advisors had numerous\nfollow-up calls and email exchanges with representatives of each of the bidders to provide additional business and financial due diligence.\nOn June 11, 2021, representatives of Centerview received another inbound inquiry from a financial advisor representing a financial sponsor who\nhad not previously been contacted by Centerview as part of this strategic process (\u201cBidder 4\u201d). The Company ultimately determined not to engage with\nBidder 4 as Bidder 4 did not provide any financing plans or indicate a price range in their proposal.\nFrom time to time, representatives of Centerview also received inbound inquiries on the status of a potential transaction from former potential\ncounterparties that had since withdrawn from the process. None of these former potential counterparties expressed any interest in reengaging in the\nprocess with respect to an acquisition of the entire Company.\n-31-\nTable of Contents\nAlso on June 11, 2021, representatives of CGC notified representatives of Centerview that representatives of the Wall Street Journal had contacted\nrepresentatives of CGC regarding a leak with respect to a potential transaction between Sanderson Farms and CGC.\nAt a remote meeting held on June 13, 2021, representatives of Centerview provided the Board of Directors with an update on the strategic process,\nincluding the progress on business and financial due diligence by each of the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, the receipt of inbound inquiries from Bidder 3\nand Bidder 4, and CGC\u2019s notification of the leak. Representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton discussed with the Board of Directors potential\nstrategies and responses should individual members of the Board of Directors be contacted by press or stockholders concerning the leak.\nOn June 21, 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Sanderson Farms was in discussions with multiple parties, including CGC, in connection\nwith a potential sale.\nOn June 30, 2021, representatives of Centerview sent a process letter to the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, requesting final proposals by July 20, 2021.\nOn July 6, 2021, Sanderson Farms circulated a form of merger agreement to the Bidder Group and Bidder 2, and instructed the bidders to contact\nWachtell Lipton with any questions.\nBetween May and July 2021, representatives of the Bidder Group participated in site visits in Texas, Mississippi and North Carolina and more than\na dozen virtual diligence meetings with management, which virtual diligence meetings were supervised by Sanderson Farms\u2019 financial and legal advisors.\nMembers of management also responded, through Sanderson Farms\u2019 advisors, to numerous follow-up diligence requests and questions from the bidders\nafter these meetings. Bidder 2 and its representatives continued to conduct limited diligence on Sanderson Farms, but informed representatives of\nCenterview that they were having difficulties with obtaining the requisite financing for a potential acquisition.\nOn July 14, 2021, representatives of Bidder 2 indicated to representatives of Centerview that they would not be in a position to submit a final\nproposal and withdrew from the process because they were unable to secure the requisite financing for a potential acquisition.\nOn or about July 16, 2021, representatives of CGC contacted representatives of Centerview to convey that the Bidder Group could not come to\nagreed terms with respect to the Investment Agreement in light of certain terms in the draft Merger Agreement, and as a result would not be in a position\nto submit a final proposal by July 20, 2021. Over the course of July 17, 2021 and July 18, 2021, representatives of Centerview discussed with\nrepresentatives CGC certain terms of the draft Merger Agreement in the context of the Investment Agreement. On July 19, 2021, representatives of the\nBidder Group contacted representatives of Centerview to convey that the Bidder Group would submit a final proposal on July 20, 2021, and previewed\ncertain terms in the Bidder Group\u2019s markup of the draft Merger Agreement and their Investment Agreement that would be important in order for the\nBidder Group to move forward, including that the cash equity contribution funded by Cargill under the Investment Agreement would be conditioned on\nthe absence of the occurrence of a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect.\nOn July 20, 2021, representatives of the Bidder Group submitted a final proposal to acquire Sanderson Farms for $202.00 per share in cash. In\naddition to its final proposal, the Bidder Group submitted a mark-up of the draft Merger Agreement and accompanying disclosure schedules, an executed\ncommitment letter and redacted fee letter from Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc. and Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A. for up to $3.25 billion in\nsenior secured credit facilities in connection with the transaction, and a redacted draft Investment Agreement providing for the contribution by CGC of its\nownership interests in Wayne Farms and the equity financing from CMSC (an affiliate of Cargill), which the equity financing would be conditioned on,\namong other things, the absence of the occurrence of a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect.\nAt an in-person meeting held on July 22, 2021 (with some attendees joining virtually), the Board of Directors discussed the terms of the Bidder\nGroup\u2019s final proposal. Representatives of Centerview provided an\n-32-\nTable of Contents\noverview of the strategic process leading up to the date of the meeting, and summarized the material terms of the Bidder Group\u2019s final proposal.\nRepresentatives of Wachtell Lipton then provided a summary of the terms reflected in the current draft of the transaction documents as submitted by the\nBidder Group. Members of management also presented an updated version of Sanderson Farms\u2019 five-year financial forecast model to the Board of\nDirectors and discussed key assumptions underlying such model. The updated forecast model reflected increased earnings expectations for the fiscal\nyear ended October 31, 2021 as a result of improvements in poultry markets but was otherwise substantially the same as the forecast model presented at\nthe meeting of the Board of Directors held on March 30, 2021. Following discussion, representatives of Centerview reviewed with the Board of Directors\nthe premiums and multiples implied by the Bidder Group\u2019s final proposal in the context of trading multiples for selected public companies and multiples\nimplied by selected precedent transactions. The Board of Directors then engaged in a discussion regarding the valuation of Sanderson Farms implied by\nthe Bidder Group\u2019s $202.00 per share proposal in the context of the analyses provided by Centerview, as well as the assumptions underlying\nmanagement\u2019s projections and the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving such projections. The Board of Directors discussed next steps as\nwell as strategies for seeking an increase in the price and an improvement in the other terms offered by the Bidder Group in their final proposal.\nBetween July 22, 2021 and July 24, 2021, management continued to refine Sanderson Farms\u2019 counterproposal with Centerview and Sanderson\nFarms\u2019 legal advisors, based on the direction provided by the Board of Directors.\nOn July 25, 2021, representatives of Centerview contacted representatives of the Bidder Group to convey Sanderson Farms\u2019 counterproposal,\nwhich included a cash merger consideration of $206.00 per share as well as Sanderson Farms\u2019 position on certain issues concerning regulatory approvals,\ncertain employee matters, the amount and circumstances pursuant to which certain termination fees would be payable and remedies available to the party\nin the case of a willful and intentional breach by the other party.\nLater that day, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d), CGC\u2019s\nlegal advisor, and representatives of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (\u201cFreshfields\u201d), Cargill\u2019s legal advisor, a revised draft of the Merger\nAgreement reflecting the counterproposal as conveyed by Centerview.\nOn July 27, 2021, representatives of the Bidder Group provided a revised proposal to acquire Sanderson Farms for $203.00 per share in cash, and\nconveyed to representatives of Centerview and representatives of Wachtell Lipton (through their legal advisors) their proposal concerning the issues\nregarding regulatory approvals, certain employee matters, termination fees and remedies in the event of a willful and intentional breach of the Merger\nAgreement.\nAlso on July 27, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton sent representatives of Paul Weiss and Freshfields a revised draft of the disclosure\nschedules, Investment Agreement and debt commitment letter.\nOn August 2, 2021, at the request of the Board of Directors in order to help better assess the risk as to whether a Wayne Farms Material Adverse\nEffect could occur, thereby relieving Cargill of its obligation to fund the cash equity contribution pursuant to the Investment Agreement, members of\nSanderson Farms\u2019 management and its legal and financial advisors attended a general diligence session hosted by representatives of Wayne Farms. A\nfurther session was held on August 3, 2021 among the parties\u2019 respective legal counsels to discuss certain legal matters pertaining to Wayne Farms.\nFrom July 27, 2021 to August 7, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the Merger Agreement and other transaction\ndocuments with representatives of Paul Weiss and Freshfields and held several calls to negotiate the final terms of such documents. During this period,\nrepresentatives of Centerview also held several calls with representatives of CGC and Cargill to discuss open issues. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton\nnegotiated several legal issues with representatives of Paul Weiss and Freshfields, including issues relating to termination fees and remedies, the\ntreatment of equity awards and employee matters, and the remedies of the parties (including the right to specific performance and damages in the event of\na termination of the Merger Agreement).\n-33-\nTable of Contents\nAt a virtual meeting held on August 7, 2021, representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided the Board of Directors with a summary of the terms of the\ndraft of the Merger Agreement and financing documents, noting changes from the summary of the Merger Agreement previously provided to the Board\nof Directors.

Representatives of Centerview then reviewed with the Board of Directors their valuation analyses\nwith respect to Sanderson Farms based on management\u2019s projections. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton, assisted by representatives of Brunini and\nFishman Haygood, discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Mississippi law in connection with a potential sale of Sanderson\nFarms. Following this discussion, representatives of Centerview left the meeting, at which point representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Fishman\nHaygood reviewed Centerview\u2019s draft engagement letter and relationships disclosure letter made available to the Board of Directors prior to the meeting.\nThe representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Fishman Haygood discussed Centerview\u2019s relationships with CGC, Cargill and/or their respective affiliates\nthat had been disclosed. The Board of Directors reviewed the disclosures and determined that none of Centerview\u2019s disclosed relationships with CGC,\nCargill and/or their respective affiliates constituted a disqualifying conflict with respect to its engagement by Sanderson Farms in connection with the\npotential transaction. After further discussion and deliberation, the Board of Directors unanimously approved Sanderson Farms\u2019 entry into the\nengagement letter with Centerview.\nLater that day, following the board meeting, Sanderson Farms entered into the engagement letter with Centerview.\nOn August 8, 2021, the Board of Directors held a virtual meeting to discuss and consider whether to approve Sanderson Farms\u2019 entry into definitive\ntransaction documents providing for a merger of Sanderson Farms with and into an affiliate of the Bidder Group. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton,\nassisted by representatives of Brunini and Fishman Haygood, discussed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary duties under Mississippi law in\nconnection with a potential sale of Sanderson Farms. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then summarized the terms of the draft of the Merger Agreement\nand financing documents compared to the terms previously reviewed, referencing the summary of the Merger Agreement previously provided to the\nBoard of Directors. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided a summary of the proposed employment and compensation arrangements between\ncertain members of management and the Bidder Group following the consummation of the proposed transaction, as well as the regulatory approvals that\nwill be required in connection with the transaction, and the covenants of the parties in the draft transaction documents related to such regulatory efforts.\nThe members of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) convened a meeting and approved the\nproposed employment and compensation arrangements in connection with the proposed transaction. Thereafter, representatives of Centerview presented\nto the Board of Directors Centerview\u2019s financial analysis and rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in\nwriting on the same date, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the\nassumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, as set forth in its written opinion, the $203.00 per share in cash\nto be paid to the holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        "Section Text": "Reasons for the Merger\u037e Recommendation of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors, in consultation with the legal advisors and financial advisors and the management team, evaluated the Merger Agreement,\nthe Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and unanimously (i) determined that it is fair to and in the best interests\nof Sanderson Farms and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) adopted the plan of merger set forth in this\nMerger Agreement, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions\ncontemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iv) recommends the approval of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Sanderson Farms.\nIn the course of reaching its recommendation, the Board of Directors considered a number of positive factors relating to the Merger Agreement and\nthe Merger, each of which the Board of Directors believed supported its decision, including the following:\nPremium and Multiples. The Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of the common stock, including the market\nperformance of the common stock relative to those of other participants in Sanderson Farms\u2019 sector and general market indices, and the fact that the\nmerger consideration of $203.00 per share in cash represents a substantial premium to estimates of Sanderson Farms\u2019 unaffected stock price, including a\npremium of 30.3% to Sanderson Farms\u2019 stock price on June 19, 2021, the trading day immediately prior to the leak published in the Wall Street Journal, a\npremium of 22.8% to Sanderson Farms\u2019 30-day volume-weighted average stock price as of June 18, 2021 and a premium of 15.2% to Sanderson Farms\u2019 all-\ntime high stock price as of June 18, 2021.\nBest Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value / Thorough Process. The Board of Directors considered that the present value of the merger\nconsideration of $203.00 in cash per share was more favorable to Sanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders than the potential value that might result from other\nalternatives reasonably available to Sanderson Farms, including, but not limited to, special dividends or distributions, leveraged stock repurchases, an\nacquisition or a series of acquisitions, an asset sale or divestiture of a business segment of Sanderson Farms, and the continued operation of Sanderson\nFarms on a stand-alone basis in light of a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nThat positive macroeconomic and industry factors, including increased demand in the Company\u2019s products and the resurgence of the\npoultry industry post-Covid 19, as well as internal factors, such as Sanderson Farms\u2019 valuation and management\u2019s projections, suggested\nthat this would be an opportune time to explore a sale process and obtain maximum value for Sanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nThat Sanderson Farms had conducted a lengthy and thorough process since the Board of Directors\u2019 decision to explore a strategic process\non March 30, 2021, involving outreach to 12 potential acquirers and inbound inquiries from 2 potential acquirers, of which 8 entered into\nnon-disclosure agreements with Sanderson Farms and received due diligence, 2 provided first round indications of interest, and one party\n\u2014 the Bidder Group \u2014 provided a final definitive proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nThat the Bidder Group stated the $203.00 in cash per share proposal represented the Bidder Group\u2019s best and final proposal following the\nBoard of Directors\u2019 rejection of the Bidder Group\u2019s first two proposed final proposals, offering, respectively, $200.00 per share and $202.00\nper share\u037e\n\u2022\nThat the fact that Sanderson Farms was exploring a strategic transaction was well publicized since the leak published in the Wall Street\nJournal (including through various subsequent news reports) and that Sanderson Farms and Centerview responded to third parties who\nexpressed interest in a possible transaction on an unsolicited basis and who they believed were reasonably capable of consummating a\ntransaction, by offering such third parties the opportunity to conduct due diligence and make a proposal, subject only to the requirement\nthat they enter into a customary non-disclosure agreement\u037e and\n\u2022\nThat the Board of Directors had conducted extensive deliberations over a period of five months in connection with the strategic process, at\nboth regularly scheduled and special meetings attended by all members of the Board of Directors, to discuss updates regarding the strategic\nprocess.\n-35-Table of Contents\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC. The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presentation of Centerview and the oral opinion of\nCenterview rendered to the Board of Directors on August 8, 2021, which were subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the effect that, as of\nsuch date and based upon and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and\nqualifications to the review undertaken, as set forth in Centerview\u2019s written opinion, the $203.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders of shares of\ncommon stock in the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled \u201c\u2014\nOpinion of Centerview Partners LLC.\u201d\nGreater Certainty of Value. The Board of Directors considered that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, so that the transaction allows\nSanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders to realize a fair value for their investment and provides such stockholders certainty of value for their shares, especially\nwhen viewed against the risks inherent in Sanderson Farms\u2019 business, including the following:\n\u2022\nThat Sanderson Farms\u2019 business plan and the",

        "Section Text": "Management Projections\nExcept for a financial outlook with respect to the current fiscal quarter and year issued in connection with its ordinary course earnings\nannouncements, Sanderson Farms does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance, earnings or other\nresults due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections, especially over the longer term periods. However,\nSanderson Farms is including a summary of certain previously nonpublic, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by its management for the\nfiscal years ending October 31, 2021 through October 31, 2025 (the \u201cManagement Projections\u201d) in order to provide Sanderson Farms Stockholders with\naccess to information that was made available to, and approved by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger\nConsideration. Selected line items from the Management Projections for fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2022 were also made\navailable to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with their due diligence review, and the Management Projections were made available to Centerview in\nconnection with the rendering of its opinion to the Board of Directors.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Management Projections.\n(In millions)\n2021E\n2022E\n2023E\n2024E\n2025E\nNet Sales\n$ 4,571\n$ 4,528\n$ 4,461\n$ 4,467\n$ 4,742\nEBITDA(1)\n$\n626\n$\n653\n$\n644\n$\n477\n$\n503\nNOPAT(2)\n$\n347\n$\n361\n$\n348\n$\n206\n$\n216\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow(3)\n$\n360\n$\n350\n$\n157\n$\n125\n$\n255\n(1)\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated in the\nManagement Projections as net sales, less cost of sales, less selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d), plus depreciation and\namortization (\u201cD&A\u201d).\n-46-Table of Contents\n(2)\nNet operating profit after tax (\u201cNOPAT\u201d) is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated in the Management Projections as (i) EBITDA less\nD&A times (ii) one minus the tax rate which was assumed to be 24% for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and 24.5% for subsequent fiscal\nyears.\n(3)\n\u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow\u201d is a non-GAAP financial measure which was calculated by Centerview in connection with its discounted cash flow\nanalysis, using the financial information provided by Sanderson Farms in the Management Projections, as NOPAT (as shown in the table above)\nplus (i) D&A, less (ii) capital expenditures, less (iii) the increase in net working capital.\nImportant Information Regarding the Management Projections\nThe Management Projections were developed by Sanderson Farms management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and the\nother transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of\nthe transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although\nthe Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Sanderson\nFarms management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future\nevents, as well as matters specific to Sanderson Farms\u2019 business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are\nbeyond Sanderson Farms\u2019 control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, Sanderson\nFarms\u2019 performance, industry performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse\nchanges in applicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in Sanderson\nFarms\u2019 reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be\nsignificantly higher or lower than the Management Projections. The Management Projections cover several years, and such information by its nature\nbecomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by Sanderson Farms\u2019 ability to achieve\nstrategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that\nare subject to change and cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such.\nThe inclusion of the Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Sanderson Farms, Centerview, their respective officers,\ndirectors, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable\nprediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement\nshould not be regarded as an indication that the Management Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made\nby Sanderson Farms or any other person regarding the Management Projections or Sanderson Farms\u2019 ultimate performance compared to such\ninformation. The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information\nabout Sanderson Farms contained in Sanderson Farms\u2019 public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement\ncaptioned \u201cWhere You Can Find More Information.\u201d In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections,\nstockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.\nThe Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published\nguidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or the guidelines established by\nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. Neither Sanderson Farms\u2019 independent auditor\nnor any other independent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Management Projections, nor have they\nexpressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.\n-47-\nTable of Contents\nEBITDA, NOPAT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures,\u201d\nwhich are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the Management\nProjections were relied upon by Centerview for purposes of its opinion and by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The\nSEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP\nfinancial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document\nsuch as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by Centerview for purposes of its opinion\nor by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. Accordingly, Sanderson Farms has not provided a reconciliation of the\nfinancial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used\nby Sanderson Farms may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non- GAAP\nfinancial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe summary of such information above is included solely to give stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Board of\nDirectors, Centerview, Parent and Merger Sub, and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any stockholder to make any investment\ndecision with respect to the Merger. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the\ndate they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Sanderson Farms does not intend\nto update or otherwise revise the Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or\nto reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.\nInterests of Sanderson Farms\u2019 Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nThe directors and executive officers of Sanderson Farms have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the\ninterests of stockholders of Sanderson Farms generally. The members of the Board of Directors were aware of, and considered, these interests, among\nother matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the stockholders of Sanderson Farms\nadopt the Merger Agreement. Sanderson Farms\u2019 stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote \u201cFOR\u201d the Sanderson\nFarms Merger proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified within the narrative disclosure and in the\nsection of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms\u2019 Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Merger\u201d below. The Merger will constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the compensation arrangements described below.\nFor purposes of this disclosure the Sanderson Farms executive officers include:\n\u2022\nJoe F. Sanderson, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n\u2022\nLampkin Butts, President and Chief Operating Officer\n\u2022\nMike Cockrell, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal Officer\n\u2022\nTim Rigney, Secretary and Controller\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following\nassumptions were used:\n\u2022\nthe relevant price per share of Sanderson Farms common stock is the Merger Consideration of $203.00 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock\nin cash, without interest\u037e\n-48-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe Merger occurs on December 31, 2021, which is the assumed completion date of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e\nand\n\u2022\nthe employment of each executive officer of Sanderson Farms is terminated without cause or for good reason (each, a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d) on\nDecember 31, 2021, immediately following the completion of the Merger.\nAs a result of these assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by Sanderson Farms\u2019 executive officers and non-employee directors\nmay differ materially from the amounts set forth in this section. For purposes of the discussion in this section, \u201csingle trigger\u201d refers to benefits that arise\nsolely as a result of the completion of the Merger and \u201cdouble trigger\u201d refers to benefits that require two conditions, which are the completion of the\nMerger and either the completion of a subsequent, time-based vesting period or a qualifying termination of employment on or following the Effective\nTime.\nTreatment of Sanderson Farms Equity Awards\nCompany Restricted Shares. Each share of Sanderson Farms restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than\nany such shares of Sanderson Farms restricted stock granted to employees on or following August 8, 2021) will be fully vested and converted into the\nright to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, which will be paid no later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time.\nThe levels, participants, terms and treatment of any shares of Sanderson Farms restricted stock granted to employees on or following August 8, 2021 will\nbe agreed between Sanderson Farms and Parent.\nCompany Performance Share Awards for Individuals Other Than Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell. For each performance share award that\nis outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including those held by Mr. Rigney):\n\u2022\neach share of Sanderson Farms common stock covered by the award that is earned based on actual performance through October 31, 2021\n(prorated according to the number of days elapsed during the applicable performance period as of the Effective Time) will be converted into\nthe right to receive the Merger Consideration, which will be paid within five Business Days following the Effective Time, and\n\u2022\nthe excess of the maximum number of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock covered by the award over the earned shares of Sanderson\nFarms common stock covered by the award that is earned based on actual performance through October 31, 2021 (prorated according to the\nnumber of days elapsed during the applicable performance period as of the Effective Time) will convert into an unvested cash award that\nwill vest on the first anniversary of the closing date or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment and be paid within five\nBusiness Days following the vesting date (but no later than the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger), subject to continued\nemployment through such vesting date.\nCompany Performance Share Awards for Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell. At the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding\nperformance share award held by each of Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell will vest and be earned at the maximum level of performance, meaning\n200% of the target number of shares covered by the awards (such maximum number of shares is equal to 76,500, 21,000 and 16,500, respectively), and each\nearned share will be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, which amount will be payable no later than\nthe fifth Business Day following the Effective Time.\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms\u2019 Named Executive\nOfficers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of unvested equity awards held by Sanderson Farms\u2019 named executive officers.\n-49-\nTable of Contents\nSeverance\nExecutive Employment Agreements\nSanderson Farms entered into an employment agreement with each of Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell in 2009. The agreements were\nsuperseded by new agreements in 2015, and the new agreements were amended on August 8, 2021 in connection with the Merger. The agreements\nprovide for a lump sum severance payment to be paid to such officer if, (i) before a change in control of Sanderson Farms, such officer is terminated\nwithout \u201ccause,\u201d except in the case of poor performance\u037e or (ii) at or after a change in control, such officer is terminated without \u201ccause\u201d\u037e or (iii) such\nofficer resigns for \u201cgood reason\u201d (each, a \u201cqualifying termination\u201d).\nThe employment agreements provide for the following severance in the event of a qualifying termination:\n\u2022\nin the case of Mr. Sanderson, three times, and in the case of Messrs. Butts and Cockrell, two times the sum of (i) the officer\u2019s annual\nbase salary for fiscal year 2021, plus (ii) 50% of the maximum bonus available to the officer under the Sanderson Farms bonus program\nin effect for fiscal year 2021 (the \u201cBonus Amount\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\na pro-rata bonus for the year in which employment termination occurs equal to the Bonus Amount, prorated based on the number of\ndays elapsed from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the officer\u2019s employment terminates\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe continuation of medical benefits that the officer would otherwise be eligible to receive for 24 months or, if earlier, until the time the\nofficer becomes eligible for substantially similar benefits from a subsequent employer.\nThe severance payments are payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the officer\u2019s qualifying termination. Each employment\nagreement includes a (i) confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement covenant in perpetuity, (ii) two-year post-termination non-compete and (iii) two-\nyear post-termination non-solicitation of customers and employees. The severance payments are conditioned upon the officer signing (and not revoking)\na release of claims in favor of Sanderson Farms and complying with applicable restrictive covenants.\nSanderson Farms Severance Plan\nOn August 8, 2021, Sanderson Farms adopted a severance plan that will take effect upon a change of control of Sanderson Farms, including\ncompletion of the Merger. Under the plan, each regular, full-time salaried employee of Sanderson Farms as of the date immediately preceding a change in\ncontrol (excluding any employees who are (i) classified as temporary or seasonal employees or (ii) covered by another plan, employment agreement or\narrangement that provides service benefits upon or in connection with a change of control (which includes Messrs. Sanderson, Butts and Cockrell)),\nincluding Mr. Rigney, will be entitled to a lump sum payment upon a qualifying termination of employment, with such payment based on the employee\u2019s\nyears of service with Sanderson Farms. A qualifying termination for purposes of the severance plan means a termination of employment that occurs upon\na change of control or during the nine months following the change in control, in each case, either by Sanderson Farms without \u201ccause\u201d or by the\nemployee for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\nUpon a qualifying termination, eligible employees (including Mr. Rigney) will be entitled to a lump sum severance payment consisting of two weeks\nof salary for each completed and partial year of service with Sanderson Farms, with a minimum of 13 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks. An employee will\nnot be entitled to receive any such severance payment unless the employee has signed and not revoked a release of claims in favor of Sanderson Farms.\nQuantification of Severance\nSee the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms\u2019 Named Executive\nOfficers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of severance payments in the event of a qualifying termination.\n-50-\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year 2022 Cash Bonuses\nIf the Effective Time occurs on or after November 1, 2021, Sanderson Farms employees employed as of the Effective Time shall receive fiscal year\n2022 bonuses calculated at the target performance level and pro-rated for the portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed through the later of the Effective\nTime and April 1, 2022. See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms\u2019\nNamed Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\u201d for the estimated value of 2022 annual cash bonus payments to the named executive officers.\nTransaction Bonus\nMr. Rigney is eligible to receive a cash transaction bonus conditioned upon the successful completion of the Merger. The aggregate amount of Mr.\nRigney\u2019s bonus is equal to $174,972. Fifty percent of the bonus will vest and be payable immediately before the Effective Time, and the remaining 50% will\nvest and be payable upon the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, in each case, subject to Mr. Rigney\u2019s continued employment through the\napplicable vesting date\u037e provided that, in the event Mr. Rigney experiences a qualifying termination prior to the first-year anniversary of the Effective\nTime, the unvested portion of the transaction bonus will vest and become payable upon the date of such qualifying termination.\nOther New Employment and Compensation Arrangements After the Merger\nAny executive officers who are retained to provide services to the combined company may enter into new individualized compensation\narrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by the combined company. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement, no new individualized compensation arrangements for such persons have been established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nUnder the Merger Agreement, certain indemnification and insurance rights exist in favor of Sanderson Farms\u2019 current and former directors and\nofficers, and certain current and former employees. See \u201cProposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement\u2014Indemnification and Insurance\u201d for\ninformation about these rights.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Sanderson Farms\u2019 Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of\ninformation about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Sanderson Farms that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. This\ncompensation is referred to as \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of\nthe stockholders of Sanderson Farms.\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following\nassumptions were used:\n\u2022\nthe relevant price per share of Sanderson Farms common stock is the Merger Consideration of $203 per share of Sanderson Farms common stock in\ncash, without interest\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger occurs on December 31, 2021, which is the assumed completion date of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e\nand\n\u2022\neach executive officer of Sanderson Farms experiences a qualifying termination on December 31, 2021 immediately following the completion of the\nMerger.\n-51-\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of these assumptions and the assumptions included in the footnotes below, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by Sanderson\nFarms\u2019 named executive officers may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the table below. The amounts below do not reflect certain\ncompensation actions that may occur after the date hereof and before completion of the Merger. The calculations in the table below do not include\namounts the Sanderson Farms named executive officers were already entitled to receive or vested in as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do\nnot attempt to forecast any additional equity or cash award grants, issuances or forfeitures that may occur, prior to the Effective Time, except as\ndiscussed in the narrative above.\nNamed\nExecutive\nOfficer\nCash\n($)(1)\nEquity\n($)(2)\nOther\n($)(3)\nTotal\n($)\nJoe F.

For each officer, severance payments are payable in a lump sum and become\npayable only upon a qualifying termination (i.e., double trigger) under the executive employment agreements or severance plan, as applicable, on or\nfollowing the completion of the Merger (see the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c\u2014Severance\u201d). Half of the transaction bonus payable to\nMr. Rigney, or $87,486, is a \u201csingle-trigger\u201d payment and the other half is a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d payment (see the section of this proxy statement\nentitled \u201c\u2014Management Transaction Bonus\u201d). Each employment agreement provides that the receipt of the severance thereunder is subject to\ncompliance with a (i) confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement covenant in perpetuity, (ii) two-year post-termination non-compete and (iii) two-\nyear post-termination non-solicitation of customers and employees.

It is expected that $2,500 million of the debt financing will be needed at\nthe closing of the Merger, consisting of the senior secured term loan A-1, senior secured term loan A-2 and senior secured term loan B facilities. The $750\nmillion senior secured revolving credit facility is not expected to be drawn down at the closing of the Merger but shall be available to the Borrower on and\nafter the closing of the Merger.\nThe proceeds of the debt financing will be used (i) to finance the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the\nclosing date, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement on the closing date, (ii) to repay\nindebtedness of the Company under its existing credit facilities (the \u201cClosing Refinancing\u201d), (iii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection\ntherewith and (iv) subject to a maximum amount to be agreed, to fund working capital and general corporate purposes (including to finance any closing\ndate working capital needs of the Company or its subsidiaries on the closing date). The aggregate principal amount of the debt financing may be\nincreased to fund certain original issue discount or upfront fees in connection with the debt financing.\nThe obligations of the financing sources under the debt commitment letter to provide the debt financing are subject to a number of limited\nconditions that are customary for acquisition financing of this type, including, among other things, (i) since August 8, 2021, there shall not have been any\nCompany Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 1: Approval of the Merger Agreement\u2014\nRepresentations and Warranties\u201d), (ii) the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any\namendments, waivers or consents thereof or thereto that are adverse to the interests of the lenders in any material respect without the consent of the lead\narrangers), (iii) the\n-53-\nTable of Contents\nconsummation of the equity financing and Wayne Farms contribution, (iv) the consummation of the Closing Refinancing, (v) the delivery of certain\naudited, unaudited and pro forma financial statements, (vi) the taking of certain limited actions necessary to establish and perfect a security interest in the\napplicable collateral, subject to certain exceptions, (vii) the receipt of documentation and other information required under applicable \u201cknow your\ncustomer\u201d and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act), (viii) the execution and delivery by the borrower and\nguarantors of definitive documentation with respect to the applicable debt facilities consistent with the debt commitment letter, (ix) the delivery of certain\ncustomary closing documents (including a customary solvency certificate), (x) the accuracy of certain limited representations and warranties and (xi) the\npayment of applicable invoiced fees and expenses. In addition, the financing sources are not obligated to fund the debt financing prior to September 30,\n2021.\nThe obligations of the debt financing sources under the debt commitment letter to provide the debt financing will terminate at 11:59 p.m., New York\nCity time, on May 13, 2022 (or if the End Date under the Merger Agreement is automatically extended in accordance with the terms and conditions\nthereof, August 15, 2022) or such earlier date on which either the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the\nconsummation of the Merger) or the Merger is consummated without the use of such debt financing.\nIf any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the above mentioned debt commitment\nletter and the fee letters related thereto, Parent has agreed under the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable\nfollowing the occurrence of such event, obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources, (i) on terms and conditions not materially less\nfavorable (taken as a whole) to Parent than those contemplated in the debt commitment letter (taking into account any \u201cmarket flex\u201d terms) and (ii) in an\namount, together with other portions of the financing that remain available to Parent and Merger Sub, sufficient to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the Merger Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses\u037e provided that Parent has no obligation to obtain debt financing on terms\nmaterially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms (taken as a whole) contained in the original debt commitment letter (including any\n\u201cmarket flex\u201d provisions applicable thereto).\nAs of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the debt commitment letter is in effect, and Parent has not notified us of\nany plans to utilize alternative financing. The documentation governing the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter has not been\nfinalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.\nEquity Financing\nParent is party to that certain Investment Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2021, entered into by and among Holdings, CMSC, Parent and for the\npurposes of Section 2.1, Section 7.4(f) and Section 11.19 thereof only, each of CGC and Cargill (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Investment\nAgreement, CMSC has committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement, to make an equity contribution to\nParent in an aggregate amount, which together with the amounts received pursuant to the debt financing set forth above, will be sufficient to fund all\namounts required to be paid or deposited by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement and for paying all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent\npursuant to the Merger Agreement (the \u201cequity financing\u201d), and Holdings has committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the\nInvestment Agreement, to contribute all of the equity of Wayne Farms to Parent.\nFunding of the equity financing is subject to the conditions provided in the Investment Agreement, which include: (i) the conditions to the closing\nof the Merger under the Merger Agreement having been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at such closing, but\nsubject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such closing) and each of Holdings and CMSC having reasonable assurance that the debt\nfinancing shall be disbursed and the closing of the Merger shall take place substantially concurrently with, or on the same Business Day (which is\nsimilarly defined in the Investment Agreement as defined in this proxy statement) as, the closing of the equity financing, (ii) no law or order issued by any\ncourt of competent\n-54-\nTable of Contents\njurisdiction or other governmental authority preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement shall be in\neffect, (iii) the representations and warranties of Holdings being true and correct at the closing (except where the failure to be true and correct would not\nhave a Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect) and (iv) there having been no Wayne Farms Material Adverse Effect (subject to certain customary\nexclusions).\nThe obligations of CMSC to fund the equity financing and of Holdings to make the Wayne Farms contribution will terminate automatically and\nimmediately upon the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Investment Agreement may also be terminated by Holdings\nor CMSC if any governmental authority has issued an order, decree or ruling permanently restraining or prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the\nInvestment Agreement, and such order, decree or ruling has become final and nonappealable (so long as a breach by the party seeking to terminate was\nnot the proximate cause of such judgment, order, decree or ruling).",

        "Section Text": "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders\nand Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash\npursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to Sanderson Farms Stockholders who hold their shares of Sanderson Farms common stock as \u201ccapital\nassets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) (generally, property held for investment\npurposes). This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or\ndiffering interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the\nstatements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a\nposition contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any\nmatter discussed below.\nThis discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax\nconsiderations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to Sanderson Farms Stockholders subject\nto special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nbanks and other financial institutions\u037e\n-56-Table of Contents\n\u2022\nmutual funds\u037e\n\u2022\ninsurance companies\u037e\n\u2022\nbrokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities\u037e\n\u2022\ndealers or traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of accounting with respect to shares of Sanderson Farms common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts\u037e\n\u2022\nretirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts\u037e\n\u2022\ntax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that are holding shares of Sanderson Farms common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated\ntransaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar\u037e\n\u2022\nPartnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, \u201cS corporations,\u201d or any other pass-through\nentities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities)\u037e\n\u2022\nexpatriated entities subject to Section 7874 of the Code\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that are required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an\n\u201capplicable financial statement\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\npersons subject to the alternative minimum tax\u037e\n\u2022\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\nexcept as noted below, holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Sanderson Farms common\nstock (by vote or by value)\u037e\n\u2022\ngrantor trusts\u037e\n\u2022\ncontrolled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal\nincome tax\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that received their shares of Sanderson Farms common stock in compensatory transactions, through a tax-qualified retirement plan\nor pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants\u037e\n\u2022\nholders that own, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in Parent following the Merger\u037e and\n\u2022\nholders that hold their Sanderson Farms common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,\norganized or resident outside the United States.\nThis discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other\nnon-income tax consequences) or any state, local or foreign income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any\nconsiderations arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or\nany considerations in respect of any withholding required pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury\nRegulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices\nadopted in connection with any such agreement).\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a\nBeneficial Owner of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock, the U.S. federal\n-57-\nTable of Contents\nincome tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership\nand certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partners in partnerships holding shares of Sanderson Farms common stock should\nconsult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.\nTHE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS DISCUSSED HEREIN TO ANY PARTICULAR STOCKHOLDER\nWILL DEPEND ON THE STOCKHOLDER\u2019S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH\nRESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR\nCIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES.\nU.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cU.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a Beneficial Owner of shares of Sanderson Farms\ncommon stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\u2022\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u037e\n\u2022\na corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n\u2022\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source\u037e or\n\u2022\na trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more\n\u201cUnited States persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust\nvalidly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Sanderson Farms common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the\namount of cash received and the U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A\nU.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Sanderson Farms common stock. A U.S.\nHolder\u2019s gain or loss on the disposition of shares of Sanderson Farms common stock generally will be characterized as capital gain or loss. Any such\ngain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of\nthe Merger. A preferential tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders who hold different blocks of Sanderson Farms common stock (shares of Sanderson\nFarms common stock purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisor to determine how the above rules\napply to them.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThis section applies to \u201cNon-U.S. Holders.\u201d For purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d means a Beneficial Owner of Sanderson Farms\ncommon stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSubject to the discussion of backup withholding below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in\nrespect of gain recognized in connection with the Merger, unless:\n\u2022\nthe gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable\nincome tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States)\u037e\n-58-\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nsuch Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition of shares of\nSanderson Farms common stock pursuant to the Merger, and certain other specified conditions are met\u037e or\n\u2022\nshares of Sanderson Farms common stock constitute a United States real property interest (a \u201cUSRPI\u201d) by reason of the Company\u2019s status\nas a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) at any time during the shorter of\nthe five-year period preceding the effective date of the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period with respect to the applicable\nshares of Sanderson Farms common stock (the \u201cRelevant Period\u201d).\nUnless an applicable treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to tax at generally applicable\nU.S. federal income tax rates as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nmay also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax\u201d at a 30% rate (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its \u201ceffectively\nconnected earnings and profits\u201d for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.\nGain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by\nan applicable income tax treaty), which generally may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder, provided the Non-U.S. Holder has\ntimely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\nWith respect to the third bullet above, we believe that the Company is not currently, and has not been during the Relevant Period, a USRPHC. Even\nif we are or were a USRPHC, gain arising from a Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Sanderson Farms common stock pursuant to\nthe Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if the Sanderson Farms common stock is \u201cregularly traded,\u201d as defined in the applicable Treasury\nRegulations, on an established securities market, and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of the Sanderson Farms\ncommon stock throughout the Relevant Period.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nGenerally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders in connection with\nthe Merger.\nBackup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger, unless\nthe U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder\u2019s correct\ntaxpayer identification number and certifying that such holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise\ncomplies with the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding of tax may also apply to the proceeds received by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the\nMerger, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form\nW-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s status as a non-U.S. person and otherwise complies with applicable\ncertification requirements.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder generally\nwill be allowed as a credit against such holder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the IRS.\nTHE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS BASED ON CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL CHANGES OR\nINTERPRETATIONS, WHICH CAN APPLY RETROACTIVELY, COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS SET FORTH THEREIN.\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX\n-59-\nTable of Contents\nCONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF\nANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION AND HOLDERS ARE URGED TO\nCONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN LIGHT OF\nTHEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.",

See the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201cProposal 1: Approval of the\nMerger Agreement\u2014Efforts to Complete the Merger.\u201d\nUnder the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have\nbeen given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) and the Federal Trade\nCommission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or\ntermination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Sanderson Farms and Parent are required to file all necessary notification and report\nforms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the transaction\ncontemplated by the Investment Agreement) no later than 90 calendar days following the date of the Merger Agreement. However, (i) if Sanderson Farms\nand Parent have not filed the required notification and report forms under the HSR Act by the 30th calendar day from the date of the Merger Agreement,\nSanderson Farms and Parent will consult with one another in good faith to mutually determine whether to accelerate the filing of the required notification\nand report forms under the HSR Act and (ii) if at any point prior to Sanderson Farms and Parent filing the required notification and report forms under the\nHSR Act, Parent determines in good faith that it would be necessary, proper or advisable to accelerate such filing in order to obtain the expiration of the\nwaiting period under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, Parent will notify Sanderson Farms thereof in writing, and Parent and Sanderson Farms will\nfile the required notification and report forms under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable thereafter.\nThe Merger is also subject to clearance or approval by the antitrust authorities in Mexico and China. Sanderson Farms and Parent made the initial\nsubmissions for the filings in Mexico and China on September 7, 2021.\nAt any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action\nunder the applicable antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion\nof the Merger subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take\naction under applicable antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose\nconditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the transaction. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under\nantitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither Parent nor Sanderson Farms believe that the Merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can\nbe no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.\n-60-Table of Contents",
