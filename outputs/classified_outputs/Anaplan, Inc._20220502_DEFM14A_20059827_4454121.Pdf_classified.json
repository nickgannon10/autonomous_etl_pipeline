If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by stockholders and the\nother closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Anaplan, with Anaplan\ncontinuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Anaplan will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common\nstock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act,\nand we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive if the Merger is completed?\nA:\nUpon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $66.00 for each share of Anaplan common stock that\nyou own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own one hundred (100)\nshares of common stock, you will receive $6,600.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes and\nwithout interest.\nQ:\nHow does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?\nA:\nThe relationship of the Merger Consideration of $66.00 to the trading price of the common stock constituted a premium of approximately forty-six\npercent (46%) to the volume weighted average price of Anaplan\u2019s common stock for the five days ending March 18, 2022, the last trading day prior\nto the date on which Anaplan publicly announced that it had entered into the Merger Agreement.\nQ:\nWhat do I need to do now?\nA:\nWe encourage you to read this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents that we refer to in this Proxy Statement\ncarefully and consider how the Merger affects you.

You\nshould use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your\nstock certificates with your proxy card.\nQ:\nWhat happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?\nA:\nThe Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If\nyou sell or transfer your shares of Anaplan common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such\nas provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies\nAnaplan in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the\nperson to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you\n14\nTable of Contents\nwill retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting.

Instead, Anaplan will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue\nto be listed and traded on NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.\nUpon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, (i) Anaplan will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of\n$293,122,500 and (ii) Parent will be required to pay to Anaplan a reverse termination fee of $586,245,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under\ndifferent specified circumstances (in each case as described in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Termination\nFees\u201d).\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?\nA:\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Anaplan common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.\nIf a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (2) grant a proxy over the\nInternet or by telephone\u037e or (3) vote via the online portal at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your\nbank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nproposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.\n15\nTable of Contents\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are\ninsufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation\nthat will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nApproval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on\nthe subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the subject matter.\nIn determining the outcome of a stockholder vote on these proposals, we may only consider affirmative votes and negative votes cast on the\nproposals \u2013 abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered a vote cast affirmatively or negatively on a proposal and, accordingly, do not\naffect the outcome of the vote for these proposals.\nThe failure of any stockholder of record to either (1) submit a signed proxy card\u037e (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone\u037e or (3) vote\nthrough the online portal at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding,\nadvisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you\nhold your shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the\nadjournment proposal and the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to\nits named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger?\nA:\nSEC rules require Anaplan to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat is the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger for purposes\nof this advisory vote?\nA:\nThe compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is certain\ncompensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of Anaplan\u2019s named executive officers. For further detail, see the section\ncaptioned \u201cProposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in\nconnection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?\nA:\nApproval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a\ncondition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named\nexecutive officers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Anaplan or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is\nadopted by the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive\nofficers in connection with the Merger will or may be paid to Anaplan\u2019s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve such\ncompensation.\nQ:\nWhat is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA:\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to\nthose shares, to be the \u201cstockholder of record.\u201d In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Anaplan.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of shares of common stock held in\n\u201cstreet name.\u201d In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect\nto those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to\nvote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the\nstockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a \u201clegal proxy\u201d from your bank, broker or\nother nominee.\nQ:\nHow may I vote?\nA:\nIf you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Anaplan common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company,\nN.A., our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:\n\u2022\nby signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope\u037e\n\u2022\nby visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card (www.proxyvote.com)\u037e\n\u2022\nby calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card (1-800-690-6903) and following the telephone prompts\u037e\nor\n\u2022\nby virtually attending the Special Meeting and submitting your vote through the online portal.\nA control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Anaplan common stock, and\nto confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone or through the\nonline portal at the Special Meeting.

You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or\nother nominee to vote of your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if\nyou voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-\nbinding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nMay I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?\nA:\nYes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:\n\u2022\nsigning another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting\u037e\n17\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nsubmitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy\u037e\n\u2022\ndelivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary\u037e or\n\u2022\nvirtually attending the Special Meeting and submitting your vote via the online portal.\nIf you hold your shares of common stock in \u201cstreet name,\u201d you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how\nto change your vote. You should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee for virtually attending the\nSpecial Meeting and submitting your vote through the online portal.\nQ:\nWhat is a proxy?\nA:\nA proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a \u201cproxy,\u201d to vote your shares of common stock. The written document\ndescribing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a \u201cproxy statement.\u201d The document used to designate a proxy\nto vote your shares of common stock is called a \u201cproxy card.\u201d Our Board of Directors has designated the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as the proxy holders for the Special Meeting.\nQ:\nIf a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?\nA:\nRegardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet\nor telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some\nor none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.\nIf you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by\nyour properly signed proxy will be voted (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if\nnecessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special\nMeeting\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan to its\nnamed executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nQ:\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\nA:\nYou may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and multiple proxy cards or voting\ninstruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for\neach brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will\nreceive more than one proxy card.\nPlease sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting instruction card that\nyou receive.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?\nA:\nIf available, Anaplan may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting.

As a result of the Merger, our common stock will no\nlonger be publicly traded and will be delisted from NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no\nlonger file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.\nThe Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as\nwe, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).\nEffect on Anaplan if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive any\npayment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Anaplan will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and\ntraded on NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not\ncompleted, we expect that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks\nrelated to the highly competitive industry in which Anaplan operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.\nFurthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our\ncommon stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at\nwhich it trades as of the date of this Proxy Statement.\nAccordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your\nshares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Anaplan Board will continue to evaluate and review Anaplan\u2019s business operations,\nstrategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such decisions and changes regarding such matters as are deemed appropriate. If\nthe Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other\ntransaction acceptable to the Anaplan Board will be offered or that Anaplan\u2019s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.\nUpon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Anaplan will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of up to\n$293,122,500. Parent will be required to pay to Anaplan a reverse termination fee of $586,245,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under different\nspecified circumstances.

As part of this evaluation, the Anaplan Board has from time to time considered a variety of strategic\nalternatives for Anaplan, including continuing as a standalone company, pursuing a transaction with a strategic or financial acquirer or initiating other\noperational changes.\nAs part of this evaluation, in late November Anaplan management contacted Goldman Sachs following Anaplan\u2019s announcement of its quarterly\nresults for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 to receive input on possible strategic alternatives for Anaplan, including a request to prepare for an\nupcoming strategic assessment for the Anaplan Board. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also held multiple discussions with management of Anaplan in\nNovember and December of 2021 regarding possible strategic alternatives.\nStarting in early December, Mr. Frank Calderoni, Chief Executive Officer of Anaplan, held discussions with Anaplan\u2019s outside directors, including\nMr. Bob Beauchamp, lead independent director of the Anaplan Board, and Mr. Sandesh Patnam and Mr. Suresh Vasudevan, additional outside directors\non the Anaplan Board, to discuss the strategic direction of Anaplan. Mr. Calderoni and Mr. Vikas Mehta, Chief Financial Officer of Anaplan, also began\nplanning efforts regarding Anaplan\u2019s strategic direction and its future operating plans and forecast.\nAlso starting in early December, following a decline in its stock price in late November, Anaplan received unsolicited outreach from various\nfinancial acquirers, including Thoma Bravo and three private equity firms that we refer to herein as Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm B and\nPrivate Equity Firm C, proposing that Anaplan consider a variety of potential transactions, including a potential investment or other strategic transaction.\nDuring this same time period, Anaplan\u2019s management and outside directors received unsolicited input from, and held meetings with, several of its\ninvestors relating to various strategic and operational matters. Subsequently, during the period beginning in early December 2021 through February 9,\n2022, members of Anaplan management met for introductory meetings with representatives of each of Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity\nFirm B and Private Equity Firm C.\nOn December 6, 2021, Mr. Calderoni briefed the full Anaplan Board regarding recent strategic developments at Anaplan, including discussions with\nindividual outside directors and outreach from potential strategic and financial acquirers and investors, and informed the Board that the agenda of the\nregularly scheduled meeting of the Anaplan Board on December 10, 2021 would be revised to discuss these matters and focus on a strategic assessment\nof Anaplan.\nOn December 10, 2021, the Anaplan Board held a meeting, at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nAnaplan\u2019s outside legal counsel, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP (\u201cGunderson\u201d), were present. The Anaplan Board met\nto explore a broad range of possible strategic alternatives for Anaplan and to discuss overall shareholder input following Anaplan\u2019s most recent quarterly\nearnings announcement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also provided an overview on the activist investor environment.\nOn December 16, 2021, Anaplan received a letter from Corvex Management L.P. (\u201cCorvex\u201d), an activist investor, noting Corvex\u2019s view that Anaplan\nshould evaluate whether a sale of Anaplan would maximize stockholder value as compared with continuing its independent operations as a standalone\ncompany.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting, at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Gunderson\nand Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d), legal counsel to Anaplan, were present. The Anaplan Board met to evaluate whether to\nexplore possible strategic alternatives and to discuss the Corvex letter to Anaplan. After robust discussion, the Anaplan Board determined it\n34Table of Contents\nwould be appropriate to evaluate various strategic alternatives, with a focus on which alternatives might maximize value for stockholders. The Anaplan\nBoard then approved the formation of an Advisory Committee of the Anaplan Board (the \u201cAdvisory Committee\u201d), comprised of Anaplan Board members\nMr. Beauchamp, Mr. Patnam and Mr. Vasudevan, in order to enable the Anaplan Board to act more nimbly and swiftly in its consideration of strategic\nalternatives and interactions with activist investors and potential counterparties to any potential strategic transactions, it being understood that formal\napproval authority for any definitive agreements for any given strategic alternative would ultimately rest with the full Anaplan Board. The Anaplan Board\nalso discussed the need to retain a financial advisory firm experienced in dealing with activist investors. Anaplan had previously engaged Goldman Sachs\nas a lead-left bookrunner for its initial public offering and subsequently requested Goldman Sachs\u2019 advice in evaluating certain other financing and other\nmatters thereafter. Accordingly, the Anaplan Board was familiar with the general capabilities and reputation of Goldman Sachs and was aware that\nGoldman Sachs also had an activism defense practice. The Anaplan Board then approved retaining Goldman Sachs for activism defense and directed\nAnaplan management to contact Goldman Sachs in connection with this purpose as well as to discuss potential financial advisory services in connection\nwith other possible strategic alternatives.\nOn December 23, 2021, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of\nGunderson and Skadden were present to continue the discussions of the matters raised at the meetings of the Anaplan Board on December 10 and\nDecember 20, 2021. The Advisory Committee discussed Anaplan\u2019s response to recent unsolicited inbound interest from private equity firms with respect\nto a potential acquisition of, or investment in, Anaplan and to activists that had acquired stakes in Anaplan. Mr. Calderoni noted that Anaplan had\ncontacted Goldman Sachs to advise Anaplan in engaging with activist investors and to receive input on possible strategic alternatives for Anaplan. The\nAdvisory Committee discussed a broad range of potential options available to Anaplan in light of the recent unsolicited inbound interest from private\nequity firms and the letter Anaplan received from Corvex, including evaluating (i) Anaplan continuing its independent operations as a standalone\ncompany, (ii) accepting a \u201cprivate investment in a public company\u201d or \u201cPIPE investment\u201d, potentially coupled with a share buyback, (iii) engaging in one\nor more buy-side acquisitions, (iv) engaging in a merger of equals with another public company or (v) engaging in a process to evaluate a potential sale\nof Anaplan. The Advisory Committee and Anaplan management further discussed engaging one or more financial advisors in connection with evaluating\nthe various options available to Anaplan. The discussion focused on retaining Goldman Sachs and/or Qatalyst Partners in light of their strong\nrelationships with strategic and financial acquirers in the industry in which Anaplan operates and, in Goldman Sachs\u2019 case, its historical relationship with\nAnaplan. The Advisory Committee and Anaplan management also determined that Anaplan management would begin working to prepare preliminary\nfinancial projections with respect to Anaplan (the \u201cPreliminary Projections\u201d) to help evaluate Anaplan on a standalone basis relative to potential strategic\nalternatives, including a potential sale transaction.\nOn December 28, 2021, Mr. Calderoni and other Anaplan representatives met with representatives of Corvex by telephonic conference.\nRepresentatives of Corvex presented certain information comparing a valuation of Anaplan prepared by Corvex with certain of its peer companies, and\ntheir view that Anaplan was presently undervalued. Representatives of Corvex outlined their views that Anaplan had two primary options available to it:\n(i) remain as a standalone company, but engage in an operational reboot, which would be time-intensive and difficult to execute upon as a public\ncompany\u037e or (ii) engage in a full review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of Anaplan. Representatives of Anaplan and Corvex discussed\nvarious potential next steps with respect to continued discussions with Corvex, including whether Corvex would be willing to enter into a non-disclosure\nagreement with Anaplan to permit Anaplan to share material non-public information with Corvex. Mr. Calderoni and other Anaplan representatives met\nlater that day with representatives of Sard Verbinnen & Co. (\u201cSard\u201d), a leading public relations firm, Goldman Sachs, Skadden, and Gunderson to discuss\nnext steps, including receiving further direction from the Anaplan Board and Advisory Committee.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and representatives of Gunderson\nand Skadden present. The Advisory Committee met to discuss the\n35\nTable of Contents\nstatus of the Preliminary Projections being prepared by Anaplan management and a timeline to present the Preliminary Projections to the Advisory\nCommittee and the Audit Committee of the Anaplan Board (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) prior to presenting the Preliminary Projections to the full Anaplan\nBoard. The Advisory Committee again discussed engaging both Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisors to Anaplan. The\nAdvisory Committee also discussed the December 28, 2021 telephonic conference with representatives of Corvex. Mr. Calderoni updated the Advisory\nCommittee on the proposed courses of action that Corvex noted and the possibility of Corvex entering into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan to\npermit Anaplan to share material non-public information with Corvex. The Advisory Committee considered various next steps in light of views expressed\nby Corvex and potential contingencies with respect to additional requests Corvex might make of Anaplan.\nOn January 3, 2022, Mr. Calderoni and other members of Anaplan management met with representatives of Goldman Sachs to review the then\ncurrent Preliminary Projections prepared by management, which had been prepared based on the financial projections Anaplan updates on an annual\nbasis for the upcoming three to five fiscal years, but had been extrapolated by management to project Anaplan\u2019s operations based on certain key metrics\nfor the upcoming ten fiscal years. These Preliminary Projections included a \u201cbase case\u201d set of financial projections based on a set of assumptions and\nestimates that management believed were most reasonable and likely to occur, as well as alternative sets of financial projections, one based on a more\noptimistic series of assumptions and estimates related to future results and another based on a more conservative series of assumptions and estimates\nrelated to future results. As described in greater detail in the section below captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Financial Projections\u201d, these alternative\nsets of financial projections were not used or relied upon by the Anaplan Board in its decision to approve the Merger or make its recommendation to\nstockholders, nor were they used or relied upon by Goldman Sachs or Qatalyst Partners in connection with preparing their financial analyses, nor were\nthey shared with potential acquirers of Anaplan as part of the strategic review process described below.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Advisory Committee met, joined by the members of the Audit Committee, as well as with members of Anaplan management\nand representatives of Goldman Sachs, Gunderson and Skadden. Members of Anaplan management presented the Preliminary Projections and the\nvarious Anaplan performance scenarios included in the Preliminary Projections and provided an update on previous discussions with Corvex.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed its preliminary financial analyses of Anaplan based on the Preliminary Projections with the Advisory\nCommittee and members of the Audit Committee present. Skadden and Gunderson then reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Anaplan Board in connection\nwith its evaluation of a strategic review process and any response to Corvex. The Advisory Committee discussed various factors that would help to\nclarify the Preliminary Projections for review by the Anaplan Board, and other next steps, including representatives of Goldman Sachs identifying\npotential strategic and private equity acquirers that might have an interest in acquiring Anaplan and the financial capability to consummate an\nacquisition.\nAlso on January 4, 2022, Mr. Calderoni and other representatives of Anaplan met by telephonic conference with representatives of Corvex,\ncontinuing previous discussions regarding the investment Corvex had made in Anaplan common stock. Subsequently in January 2022, members of\nAnaplan management, Mr. Beauchamp and Anaplan\u2019s outside legal advisors engaged in various telephonic conferences with representatives of Corvex.\nThey discussed (i) Corvex\u2019s investment in Anaplan, (ii) Corvex\u2019s views on potential options to enhance stockholder value, (iii) the possibility of Corvex\nentering into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan to permit Anaplan to share material non-public information with Corvex and (iv) Corvex\u2019s request\nto speak with Mr. Beauchamp and Anaplan\u2019s outside financial advisors. In addition, Corvex indicated it was nearing the filing threshold with respect to\nwhich Corvex would be required to file a Schedule 13D with respect to its investment in Anaplan. Throughout this period, Corvex declined the\nopportunity to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan.\nOn January 6, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives from Gunderson and\nSkadden were present. The Anaplan Board reviewed various options available to Anaplan, including with respect to Anaplan\u2019s standalone long-term\noperating plan and a potential\n36\nTable of Contents\nstrategic review process. Skadden reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Anaplan Board in connection with reviewing the Preliminary Projections, the\nAnaplan Board\u2019s evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and the engagement with Corvex. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then joined the\nmeeting and reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of Anaplan with the Anaplan Board. Anaplan management reviewed the Preliminary Projections\nand the various performance scenarios included in the Preliminary Projections with the Anaplan Board.\nAlso on January 7, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Gunderson reviewed with the Anaplan Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a strategic review\nprocess, including any potential strategic alternatives and a potential sale of Anaplan. Anaplan management next discussed with the Anaplan Board the\nPreliminary Projections and answered additional questions with respect thereto. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided an overview of\npotential strategic and private equity acquirers of Anaplan and an overview of the differences between strategic and private equity acquirers. The\nAnaplan Board discussed with management various alternatives under consideration, including (i) Anaplan continuing its independent operations as a\nstandalone company, (ii) accepting a \u201cprivate investment in a public company\u201d or \u201cPIPE investment,\u201d potentially coupled with a share buyback, (iii)\nengaging in one or more buy-side acquisitions, (iv) engaging in a merger of equals with another public company and (v) engaging in a process to\nevaluate selling Anaplan. The Anaplan Board then discussed the overview from the representatives of Goldman Sachs on the differences between\nstrategic and private equity acquirers, including the potential willingness and ability of strategic acquirers to reach higher valuations than private equity\nacquirers. The Anaplan Board then considered the prospect of commencing a strategic review process in which it would focus initially on those potential\nstrategic acquirers that might be most able to make an attractive offer for Anaplan, and then potentially explore outreach to potential private equity\nacquirers. The Anaplan Board noted that this approach would allow the Anaplan Board to evaluate whether any transaction that emerged would be in the\nbest interests of Anaplan and its stockholders. After the representatives of Goldman Sachs left the meeting, the Anaplan Board also discussed the\npossibility of engaging a second financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners, to obtain an additional viewpoint on Anaplan\u2019s financial and trading performance\nrelative to certain peer groups and the market generally, analyst perceptions of Anaplan, the market environment, and potential financial and strategic\nacquirers of Anaplan from a financial advisor considered by Anaplan management to have significant experience with, and deep knowledge of, the\nindustry in which Anaplan operates and its participants. The Anaplan Board unanimously authorized Anaplan\u2019s management to initiate such a strategic\nreview process, focusing first on potential strategic acquirers, and then potentially later evaluating private equity acquirers. The Anaplan Board also\ninstructed management to formally engage Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners as financial advisors to Anaplan for the purpose of assisting the\nAnaplan Board with respect to a strategic review process, subject to disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with respect to any potential acquirers.\nGoldman Sachs subsequently provided a relationship disclosure letter disclosing potential conflicts with respect to the potential acquirers in the\nconnection with the strategic review process, such that the Anaplan Board was aware of any such potential conflicts of interest at the time that the\nAnaplan Board approved the sale transaction with Thoma Bravo. In addition, Qatalyst Partners subsequently provided relationship disclosure letters\nconfirming that it did not have potential conflicts of interest that would limit it from fulfilling its responsibilities as one of Anaplan\u2019s financial advisors.\nOn January 11, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,\nQatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. The Anaplan Board met to further formalize the outreach plan with respect to the strategic\nreview process it approved on January 7, 2022. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Anaplan Board a list of seven\npotential strategic acquirers that may have interest in Anaplan and financial capability to consummate an acquisition and an illustrative timeline for the\nprocess. The Anaplan Board discussed the likelihood of receiving bids in connection with a strategic review process and the negotiating posture of\nAnaplan. The Anaplan Board discussed delaying outreach to two of the potential strategic acquirers because Anaplan was currently in the process of\nnegotiating commercial agreements with them. The Anaplan Board then approved\n37\nTable of Contents\noutreach to the seven potential strategic acquirers, including on a delayed basis for the two potential acquirers with which Anaplan was currently\nnegotiating commercial agreements.\nOn January 12 and January 13, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners initiated outreach to the five potential strategic\nacquirers as directed by the Anaplan Board. Thereafter, and through February 1, 2022, members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Qatalyst Partners continued to engage with the initial five potential strategic acquirers. Three of those five strategic acquirers, which we refer\nto as Strategic Firm A, Strategic Firm B, and Strategic Firm C also entered into non-disclosure agreements with Anaplan during this period, only one of\nwhich included a standstill provision, which standstill provision included an exception allowing for the submission of private acquisition proposals to the\nAnaplan Board and a fallaway provision terminating the standstill in the event Anaplan announced a transaction with the applicable strategic acquirer.\nDuring this period, in addition to the management presentations and other meetings detailed below, representatives of Anaplan management also\nresponded to certain due diligence requests from these parties focused on operational, product, and financial diligence. One of the initial five strategic\nacquirers indicated that it did not wish to consider evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan and did not enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Anaplan.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and a representative of Gunderson\npresent. The Advisory Committee met to discuss the strategic review process and recent conversations with Corvex. Mr. Calderoni discussed the\noutreach to date and the levels of engagement from the potential strategic acquirers. The Advisory Committee then discussed whether the introduction\nof certain potential private equity acquirers could enhance the competitive dynamic of the process and potentially motivate strategic acquirers to make\nattractive bids. The Advisory Committee also discussed recent conversations with Corvex regarding the possibility of entering into a non-disclosure\nagreement with Anaplan and the likelihood of Corvex agreeing to do so and the possibility that Corvex might disrupt the strategic review process.\nOn January 20, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm A to provide Anaplan\u2019s management presentation.\nOn January 21, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm B to provide Anaplan\u2019s management presentation.\nOn January 25, 2022, representatives of Anaplan held a product demonstration with representatives of Strategic Firm A.\nOn January 28, 2022, representatives of Anaplan met with representatives of Strategic Firm C to provide Anaplan\u2019s management presentation.\nAlso on January 28, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with representatives of Strategic\nFirm B to discuss feedback from Anaplan\u2019s management presentation and next steps with respect to the potential acquisition of Anaplan.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting during which members of Anaplan management and representatives from\nGunderson and Skadden were present. Mr. Calderoni summarized discussions to date with the five potential strategic acquirers (including Strategic Firm\nA, Strategic Firm B and Strategic Firm C), but noted that the process was moving more slowly than anticipated. Mr. Calderoni also noted that the\ncommercial agreements with one of the potential strategic acquirers the Anaplan Board had previously authorized outreach to had been completed and\nthe other would be shortly, allowing for their inclusion in the strategic review process. The Anaplan Board then considered authorizing further outreach\nto an initial group of five potential private equity acquirers, including Thoma Bravo and Private Equity Firm B, and two other private equity firms, which\nwe refer to as Private Equity Firm D and Private Equity Firm E, that might be most interested\n38\nTable of Contents\nin acquiring Anaplan, based on their investment and acquisition history with technology companies, and would have the financial capacity to\nconsummate a transaction, based on the size of the investment funds raised by them. The Anaplan Board also considered an additional three potential\nprivate equity acquirers to be added to the strategic review process with similar capabilities (which included Private Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm\nC), but who might have less strong interest in acquiring Anaplan than the initial group of five potential private equity acquirers. The Anaplan Board then\napproved outreach to the five initial private equity acquirers, including Thoma Bravo. Messrs. Calderoni and Beauchamp each reported on their recent\ndiscussions with Corvex, and discussed with the Anaplan Board the likelihood of various next steps that Corvex might take, including with respect to a\npotential Schedule 13D filing with respect to Corvex\u2019s ownership interests in Anaplan.\nOn February 1, 2022 and through February 23, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners began outreach to the two additional\npotential strategic acquirers and the initial five private equity acquirers authorized by the Anaplan Board, including Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm B,\nPrivate Equity Firm D, and Private Equity Firm E. One of the two potential strategic acquirers Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners had reached out to\nfollowing the Anaplan Board\u2019s special meeting on February 1, 2022, which we refer to a Strategic Firm D, entered into a non-disclosure agreement with\nAnaplan, which agreement did not include a standstill provision. However, after an initial meeting with Anaplan\u2019s management, the other potential\nstrategic acquirer indicated that it would not be considering a potential transaction with Anaplan and did not enter into a non-disclosure agreement with\nAnaplan. Additionally, each of Strategic Firm A, Strategic Firm B and Strategic Firm C and the fifth strategic acquirer contacted following the Anaplan\nBoard\u2019s special meeting on January 11, 2022 (which had an initial meeting with Anaplan\u2019s management, but had not entered into a non-disclosure\nagreement with Anaplan), subsequently indicated during this period that they were not interested in an acquisition of Anaplan. During the period from\nFebruary 1, 2022 through February 9, 2022, Thoma Bravo and Private Equity Firm B, Private Equity Firm D, and Private Equity Firm E each entered into\nnon-disclosure agreements with Anaplan, each of which included a standstill provision, which provision included an exception allowing for the\nsubmission of private acquisition proposals to the Anaplan Board and a fallaway provision terminating the standstill in the event Anaplan announced a\ntransaction with the applicable potential private equity firm. During the period from February 1, 2022 and through February 23, 2022, in addition to the\nmanagement presentations and other meetings detailed below, representatives of Anaplan management also responded to certain due diligence requests\nfrom these parties focused on operational, product, and financial diligence.

There was no discussion of the future employment or compensation of Anaplan\u2019s management following any potential sale\ntransaction, if agreed upon.\nOn March 4, 2022, representatives of Anaplan, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with representatives from\nPrivate Equity Firm C for a product demonstration.\nAlso on March 4, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with representatives from Private\nEquity Firm A regarding financial due diligence requests.\nOn March 5, 2022, Mr. Calderoni held a telephonic conference with Mr. Orlando Bravo of Thoma Bravo to discuss Thoma Bravo\u2019s interest in\nacquiring Anaplan. There was no discussion of the future employment or compensation of Anaplan\u2019s management following any potential sale\ntransaction, if agreed upon.\nOn March 7, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners again reached out to Strategic Firm D to reiterate that first round bids\nwould be due on March 8, 2022.\nAlso on March 7, 2022, Mr. Calderoni met with representatives of Corvex, during which the Corvex representatives informed Mr. Calderoni that\nCorvex and Sachem Head had entered into an advocacy agreement and had formed a \u201cgroup\u201d for SEC purposes. As a result, their combined ownership\ninterests in Anaplan would require Corvex and Sachem Head to file a Schedule 13D with the SEC by no later than March 17, 2022.\nAlso on March 7, 2022, Mr. Calderoni and Mr. Mehta met in person with representatives from Private Equity Firm B to discuss Anaplan and Private\nEquity Firm B\u2019s interest in acquiring Anaplan. There was no discussion of the future employment or compensation of Anaplan\u2019s management following\nany potential sale transaction, if agreed upon.\nOn March 8, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held telephonic conferences with representatives of Private Equity Firm\nA and Thoma Bravo to notify them that bids would be posting later that day. A representative of Thoma Bravo delivered a strong message on the speed\nand certainty that would be reflected in Thoma Bravo\u2019s bid.\nLater on March 8, 2022, Anaplan received non-binding letters of intent from Thoma Bravo, with an initial bid of $63.00 per share in cash, Private\nEquity Firm A, with an initial bid range of $58.00 to $62.00 per share in cash, Private Equity Firm C, with an initial bid range of $58.00 to $68.00 per share in\ncash, and Private Equity Firm E, with an initial bid of $51.00 per share in cash. Private Equity Firm B did not submit a bid on March 8. Thoma Bravo\u2019s bid\nalso indicated that it would be prepared to commit to fully finance the Merger Consideration payable in the transaction with equity from Thoma Bravo\u2019s\ninvestment fund, and had requested exclusivity to permit Thoma Bravo to finalize its diligence and enter into a definitive agreement with Anaplan within a\nweek following its bid submission on March 8, 2022. In addition to indicating the ability to sign a definitive agreement within a week, as opposed to the\nthree weeks or longer timelines proposed by each of the other bidders, Thoma Bravo\u2019s bid was the only bid received that did not require additional equity\npartners. Each of the bids from Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C and Private Equity Firm E indicated that they would require equity partners as\nwell as debt financing in connection with the transaction.\nOn March 9, 2022, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,\nQatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reviewed the status and prior outreach of\nthe strategic review process, and evaluated the initial bids of each of Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C and Private\n42\nTable of Contents\nEquity Firm E. The Advisory Committee and Anaplan management discussed convening the Anaplan Board on March 10, 2022 to consider the bids\nreceived from the potential private equity acquirers in more detail.\nAlso on March 9, 2022, Private Equity Firm B, which had remained in the process but did not submit a bid on March 8, 2022, indicated that it would\nnot be further evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan.\nOn March 10, 2022, the Advisory Committee held a special meeting with members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman Sachs,\nGunderson and Skadden present. The Advisory Committee discussed the meeting that took place among representatives of Anaplan and Corvex on\nMarch 7, 2022 in which Corvex and Sachem Head had indicated that they would be filing a Schedule 13D no later than March 17, 2022. Representatives of\nGoldman Sachs reviewed potential responses to the two director nomination requests and other proposals made by Corvex and Sachem Head. The\nAdvisory Committee determined to recommend that the Anaplan Board seek to minimize the potential disruption that Corvex and Sachem Head could\ncause on the ongoing strategic review process.\nLater on March 10, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs, Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Mr. Mehta reviewed the final financial projections package (collectively the \u201cFinancial\nProjections\u201d) which had been prepared by Anaplan\u2019s management team. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners provided an overview\nof Anaplan\u2019s process in approaching fourteen parties that were viewed as having an interest in acquiring Anaplan and the financial capacity to\nconsummate an acquisition to take part in the strategic review process, with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners initially approaching\npotential strategic acquirers and then subsequently approaching potential private equity acquirers to seek to solicit credible bids to acquire Anaplan.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reported that ten potential acquirers meaningfully engaged in preliminary diligence and in\nvarious discussions with Anaplan management, with four potential strategic acquirers and six potential private equity acquirers having received\nmanagement presentations. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners noted that all but one potential strategic acquirer, Strategic Firm D,\nhad indicated that it would not further consider evaluating an acquisition of Anaplan, and that Strategic Firm D had not submitted a bid when other first\nround bids were received and had still not submitted a bid as of the time of the meeting. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners noted\nthat Thoma Bravo\u2019s offer likely had more closing certainty insofar as Thoma Bravo did not require an additional equity partner or debt financing, and\nsince Thoma Bravo indicated it could execute a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction in a week. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nQatalyst Partners presented certain preliminary valuation analyses based on the Financial Projections. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst\nPartners also shared their perspective that, for the private equity bidders that had submitted bids that included a range of values, they would likely\nrequire significant additional time and diligence work to finalize their views on valuation and as such, there was significant uncertainty as to whether a\nmore concrete offer at the higher end of their indicated ranges would ultimately be a realistic possibility. Representatives of Gunderson also reviewed with\nthe Anaplan Board its fiduciary duties in connection with a strategic review process, including a potential sale of Anaplan. Representatives of Gunderson\nalso reviewed the timing and procedural steps involved in the acquisition process. The Anaplan Board directed representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nQatalyst Partners to indicate to Thoma Bravo that its proposal did not reflect the highest possible price of the bids received and that if Thoma Bravo\nwanted to purchase Anaplan, it would need to improve its offer.\nLater on March 10, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with representatives from Thoma\nBravo to relay that Thoma Bravo\u2019s proposal did not include the highest possible price as compared to other proposals received, and if it was interested in\npurchasing Anaplan, it needed to improve its offer.\nOn March 11, 2022, representatives of Anaplan held a product overview diligence session with representatives of Strategic Firm D.\n43\nTable of Contents\nAlso on March 11, 2022, representatives of Thoma Bravo held a telephonic conference with representatives of Qatalyst Partners to discuss its bid.\nAfter discussing various concerns, the representatives of Thoma Bravo relayed that its \u201cbest and final\u201d offer was $66.00 per share in cash (which offer\ncontinued to provide for full funding of the Merger Consideration via equity if debt financing was unavailable) and requested that Anaplan seek to\nexecute a definitive agreement on the one-week timeline proposed by Thoma Bravo.\nLater on March 11, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners provided an update on\ntheir recent discussions with Thoma Bravo and the \u201cbest and final\u201d offer price Thoma Bravo made of $66.00 per share in cash. The Anaplan Board\ndiscussed the offer, the likelihood of other potential acquirers in the process exceeding the price offered by Thoma Bravo and various considerations\nrelating to Thoma Bravo\u2019s proposed timeline and price. After robust discussion, the Anaplan Board determined to direct Anaplan management, Goldman\nSachs, Qatalyst Partners and Anaplan\u2019s legal advisors to prioritize discussions with Thoma Bravo and see whether an acceptable definitive agreement\ncould be reached with Thoma Bravo at the \u201cbest and final\u201d offer price of $66.00 per share. Representatives of Skadden and Goldman Sachs then reviewed\nwith the Anaplan Board Mr. Calderoni\u2019s discussions with Corvex and Sachem Head, the director nomination proposals and other requests made by\nCorvex and Sachem Head and the fact that Corvex and Sachem Head had entered into an advocacy agreement that would cause them to become a\n\u201cgroup\u201d for SEC purposes and would require them to make a Schedule 13D filing by March 17, 2022 at the latest. Representatives of Goldman Sachs\nreviewed with the Anaplan Board potential strategies Anaplan could consider in responding to the various requests with respect to the director\nnomination and other proposals made by Corvex and Sachem Head. The Anaplan Board determined to seek to minimize the potential disruption that\nCorvex and Sachem Head could cause on the ongoing strategic review process. In executive session, the Anaplan Board also discussed Anaplan\u2019s\nregularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle, and given the possibility that Anaplan may enter into a definitive agreement with a prospective\nacquirer, the Anaplan Board discussed the advisability of delaying the regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle.\nLater on March 11, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Anaplan Board met to evaluate Anaplan\u2019s regularly scheduled equity award refresh\ngrant cycle, and to explain to Mr. Calderoni that given the possibility that Anaplan may enter into a definitive agreement with a prospective acquirer, the\nCompensation Committee had determined to delay the regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle.\nAlso on March 11, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners reached out to each of Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm\nC, and Private Equity Firm E. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners informed Private Equity Firm E that its bid of $51.00 per share was\nnot competitive with other bidders in Anaplan\u2019s strategic review process. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners relayed to Private\nEquity Firm A and Private Equity Firm C that Anaplan would allow each of Private Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm C to team up with another\npotential private equity acquirer consistent with their request to do so in their bid letters (but instructed each such party not to independently seek such\na potential partner just yet while Anaplan organized additional diligence materials to open up to Private Equity Firm A and Private Equity Firm C during\nthe week of March 21, 2022).\nOn March 12, 2022, Messrs. Calderoni and Beauchamp and representatives of Corvex and Sachem Head met to discuss the nominations made by\nCorvex and Sachem Head to the Anaplan Board and the other proposals made by the investors, among other topics, and resolved to stay in touch with\nrespect to a possible settlement agreement or coordination with respect to any future Schedule 13D filing or other public announcements to be made with\nrespect to the activists\u2019 ownership interests in Anaplan.\nAlso on March 12, 2022, Anaplan opened a comprehensive virtual data room to begin sharing detailed financial, operational and legal diligence\nmaterials and the first draft of the Merger Agreement with Thoma Bravo and its advisors. From March 12, 2022 through March 20, 2022, additional\ndiligence materials\n44\nTable of Contents\nwere exchanged and several diligence calls and other discussions relating to a potential sale of Anaplan to Thoma Bravo were held with members of\nAnaplan management, representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Gunderson, and representatives of Thoma Bravo and Thoma Bravo\u2019s\noutside advisors, including Kirkland & Ellis LLP (\u201cKirkland\u201d), Thoma Bravo\u2019s outside legal counsel.\nOn March 15, 2022, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners held a telephonic conference with Strategic Firm D to inform it that the\nprocess had accelerated with a different potential acquirer and that Anaplan may engage in an alternative transaction with such potential acquirer if the\npotential strategic acquirer did not promptly submit a bid. Strategic Firm D, the sole remaining potential strategic acquirer, did not subsequently engage or\noffer a bid with respect to an acquisition of Anaplan.\nOn March 16, 2022, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement and initial drafts of the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty\nto Gunderson. Open issues in the revised draft covered a variety of topics, including the treatment of unvested equity awards, the sizes of the termination\nfee payable by Anaplan in certain circumstances and the reverse termination fee payable by Sponsor in certain circumstances, and remedies available to\nthe parties in the event of breach.\nOn March 17, 2022, Gunderson discussed material issues raised in Kirkland\u2019s draft of the Merger Agreement with members of Anaplan\nmanagement, and representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Skadden. Gunderson then sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement,\nEquity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty to Kirkland.\nAlso on March 17, 2022, Corvex and Sachem Head made their respective Schedule 13D filings with respect to their ownership interests in Anaplan.\nOn March 18, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a regularly scheduled meeting of the Anaplan Board, at which members of Anaplan management were\npresent. Among other matters discussed at the meeting, the Anaplan Board approved the annual operating budget which contained financial projections\nconsistent with the Financial Projections but with only a single year of operations forecast. Representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners,\nGunderson and Skadden were present for a portion of the meeting. During this portion of the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst\nPartners updated the Anaplan Board on subsequent activities of management, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners and Anaplan\u2019s legal counsel. The\nrepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners described the prioritized diligence activities Anaplan had engaged in with Thoma Bravo, and the\nsubsequent outreach representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners engaged in with Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C, Private\nEquity Firm E, and Strategic Firm D. Representatives of Gunderson updated the Anaplan Board with respect to the status of ongoing negotiations with\nThoma Bravo and other status updates with respect to the transaction process. Representatives of Skadden updated the Anaplan Board with respect to\nthe additional discussions amongst Anaplan management and representatives of Corvex and Sachem Head and the Schedule 13D filings made by Corvex\nand Sachem Head on March 17, 2022. After representatives of Goldman Sachs, Qatalyst Partners and Skadden left the meeting, the Anaplan Board\ndiscussed the treatment of equity awards in the Merger Agreement, and the fact that Anaplan\u2019s regularly scheduled equity award refresh grant cycle was\ndelayed due to the pending discussions with potential prospective acquirers. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Thoma Bravo\u2019s offer was a\n\u201cbest and final\u201d offer at a price for $66.00 per share of Anaplan common stock, and in light of that fact, the Anaplan Board believed that it would be\nappropriate for management to engage with Thoma Bravo to discuss appropriate mechanisms to facilitate employee retention during the interim period\nbetween signing of a definitive agreement and closing of a transaction, including making regularly scheduled equity refresh grants and providing for\npartial acceleration of unvested equity awards upon closing.\nLater on March 18, 2022, Kirkland sent revised drafts of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty to Gunderson.\n45\nTable of Contents\nOn March 19, 2022, Mr. Calderoni held a telephonic conference with representatives of Thoma Bravo to discuss outstanding issues pertaining to\nthe Merger Agreement, including the treatment of equity awards in the transaction. Later that day Gunderson sent revised drafts of the Merger\nAgreement, Equity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty to Kirkland. Also later that day, the Anaplan Board directed Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst\nPartners to utilize the Financial Projections for the purpose of evaluating the fairness of the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo.\nDuring the morning of March 20, 2022, Kirkland and Gunderson finalized the Merger Agreement, resolving the open issues identified above,\nincluding with the equity awards receiving the treatment as provided in the section below captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Merger Consideration\u2014\nOutstanding Equity Awards\u201d.\nLater on March 20, 2022, the Anaplan Board held a special meeting at which members of Anaplan management and representatives of Goldman\nSachs, Qatalyst Partners, Gunderson and Skadden were present. Mr. Calderoni updated the Anaplan Board with respect to Anaplan management\u2019s\ninteractions with Thoma Bravo throughout the week and the progress towards agreeing to a proposed final merger agreement to be entered into with\nThoma Bravo. Following the discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Anaplan Board its financial analyses of the proposed\ntransaction and rendered an oral opinion to the Anaplan Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the\nAnaplan Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $66.00 in cash\nper share of Anaplan Common Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was\nfair from a financial point of view to such holders (see the section of this Proxy Statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinions of Anaplan\u2019s Financial\nAdvisors\u2014Opinion of Goldman Sachs, Financial Advisor to Anaplan\u201d for further details). Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then presented certain\nfinancial analyses with respect to the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo and rendered its opinion orally, that, as of the date thereof and based upon\nand subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its opinion, the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan\nCommon Stock to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common\nstock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (see the section of this Proxy Statement\ncaptioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Opinions of Anaplan\u2019s Financial Advisors\u2014Opinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan\u201d for further details).\nRepresentatives of Gunderson then reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Anaplan Board in connection with the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo\nand reviewed the material terms of the Merger Agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, and Limited Guaranty. The Anaplan Board evaluated its reasons for,\nand certain risks and other potentially negative factors relating to, the proposed transaction with Thoma Bravo as described under the section of this\nProxy Statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014",

        "Section Text": "Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger\nRecommendation of the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors, at a meeting held on March 20, 2022, unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and other\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to be advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Anaplan and its stockholders, (2) approved\nand declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, in accordance with\nthe requirements of the DGCL, (3) recommended that Anaplan\u2019s stockholders approve the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (4)\nresolved that the Merger Agreement shall be submitted to Anaplan\u2019s stockholders for approval at a special meeting of Anaplan stockholders duly held\nin accordance with the DGCL and the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and Amended and Restated Bylaws.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) \u201cFOR\u201d the adoption of the Merger Agreement\u037e (2) \u201cFOR\u201d the adjournment of\nthe Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time\nof the Special Meeting\u037e and (3) \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Anaplan\nto its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.\nReasons for the Recommendation of the Anaplan Board\nIn evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Anaplan Board consulted with Anaplan\u2019s senior management,\nits financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, and legal advisors at Gunderson and Skadden and considered, analyzed and relied upon a\nwide and complex range of factors. Based on these consultations, considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Anaplan Board\nunanimously determined that entering into the Merger Agreement would yield the highest value reasonably available for Anaplan\u2019s stockholders and is\nadvisable and fair to and in the best interests of Anaplan and its stockholders.\nIn making its determination and recommendation of the Merger to Anaplan\u2019s stockholders, the Anaplan Board considered a number of factors,\nincluding the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\nAnaplan\u2019s Financial Condition and Prospects. The Anaplan Board considered the current and historical financial condition and results of\noperations of Anaplan, as well as the strategic objectives and future prospects for Anaplan if it were to remain an independent company. The\nAnaplan Board reviewed Anaplan\u2019s current financial operating plan, including the risks and uncertainties associated with executing upon and\nachieving the plan. The Anaplan Board believes, on this basis, that the Merger Consideration fairly reflects Anaplan\u2019s intrinsic value, including its\npotential for future growth in light of the risks and uncertainties faced by Anaplan.\n47Table of Contents\nAbility to Remain Independent. The Anaplan Board considered the ability of Anaplan to remain independent and the risks and costs associated\nwith doing so, including:\n\u2022\nIndustry Risks. The Anaplan Board considered relevant industry risks, including the potential for reduced growth rates as the\nsoftware as a service (SaaS) industry matures.\n\u2022\nCompetitive Risks. The Anaplan Board considered Anaplan\u2019s competitive position in the SaaS industry, including current and\npotential future competition from larger and better funded companies which might have competitive advantages from their broader\ncommercial scope and economies of scale in pricing, and other competitors with less advanced product offerings catching up to\nAnaplan.\n\u2022\nExecution Risks. The Anaplan Board considered execution risks facing Anaplan, including go-to-market execution challenges that\nAnaplan may face.\nComplete Company Sale. The Anaplan Board believed that a 100% acquisition of the company was most likely to maximize value for Anaplan\nstockholders as compared with remaining an independent company when taking into account the aforementioned risks and costs. The Anaplan\nBoard also considered the fact that certain significant investors in Anaplan had privately expressed their view to Anaplan that a 100% acquisition\nof Anaplan would best maximize the value of Anaplan to all of Anaplan\u2019s stockholders.\nResults of Process Conducted. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that, prior to entry into the Merger Agreement with Parent, and following a\n\u201cmarket check\u201d in which representatives of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, at the direction of the Anaplan Board, conducted an outreach\ninitially to prospective strategic acquirers and subsequently to prospective private equity acquirers, none of the contacted acquirers (and no other\npotential strategic acquirers) other than Thoma Bravo, Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm C, and Private Equity Firm E, submitted an offer to\nacquire Anaplan. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Anaplan had engaged experienced financial and legal advisors to advise the\nAnaplan Board during the process. Based on the results of that process and the advice of Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners, the Anaplan\nBoard believed that the price offered by Parent was the highest that was reasonably attainable, particularly in light of the fact that the proposals\nreceived from other private equity bidders involved either an offer price expressed as a discrete number that was below the offer price from Parent\nor an offer price expressed as a range where all or a majority of the values in the range were below the offer price from Parent, as well as the belief of\nthe financial advisors that for the private equity bidders that had submitted bids that included a range of values, they would likely require\nsignificant additional time and diligence work to finalize their views on valuation and as such, there was significant uncertainty as to whether a\nmore concrete offer at the higher end of their indicated ranges would ultimately be a realistic possibility. The Anaplan Board also believed that the\nprice offered by Parent was more favorable to the Anaplan stockholders than the potential value that would reasonably be expected to result from\nother competing proposals. The Anaplan Board also believed that an acquisition transaction with Parent was most likely to be consummated and\ncould be consummated more quickly than other competing proposals, in light of the fact that (i) Parent\u2019s proposal offered to fully backstop the\naggregate Merger Consideration with equity funding from the Sponsor and (ii) the proposals received from other private equity bidders indicated\nthat debt financing would be required and that the bidders desired to partner with other private equity firms in order to fund the remainder of the\naggregate Merger Consideration offered.\nPremium to Market Price. The Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent would provide Anaplan\u2019s stockholders with the opportunity to receive a\nmeaningful premium over the current market price of the shares of Anaplan common stock. The Anaplan Board reviewed the current and historical\nmarket prices with respect to the shares of Anaplan common stock, including the fact that Parent\u2019s offer price of $66.00 per share constituted a\npremium of:\n\u2022\napproximately 30% to $50.59, the closing price of Anaplan common stock on March 18, 2022, the last trading day preceding the day\nthat the Merger Agreement was executed\u037e\n48\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\napproximately 57% to $41.99, the unaffected closing price of Anaplan common stock on February 23, 2022, the last full trading day\nprior to the issuance of a press release that Sachem Head had acquired a stake in Anaplan\u037e and\n\u2022\napproximately 42% to $46.46, the 30-day volume weighted average closing price of the Anaplan common stock, and 43% to $46.02, the\nthree-month volume weighted average closing price of the Anaplan common stock, in each case, ending as of the close of trading on\nMarch 18, 2022.\nAbility to Negotiate Increased Offer Price. The Anaplan Board also considered the fact that Parent increased its offer price from its initial offer of\n$63.00 per share to $66.00 per share of Anaplan common stock and indicated that its offer price of $66.00 per share of Anaplan common stock was\nits \u201cbest and final\u201d offer. The Anaplan Board believed that the price offered by Parent was the highest price reasonably attainable, in light of\nseveral factors, including without limitation the course of negotiations with Parent, the results of Goldman Sachs\u2019 and Qatalyst Partners\u2019 outreach\nto other potential acquirers and the likelihood of other potential acquirers making a higher offer.\nMarket Volatility and Uncertainty Regarding Similar Strategic Alternatives. The Anaplan Board also considered the volatility in the public\nmarkets and uncertainty of the availability to Anaplan of similar strategic alternatives in the future in light of current marketplace conditions.\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs, Financial Advisor to Anaplan.\nThe Anaplan Board considered the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Anaplan Board by Goldman Sachs at a meeting of the\nAnaplan Board on March 20, 2022. At such meeting of the Anaplan Board, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by\ndelivery of its written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the Anaplan Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject\nto the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan Common Stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent\nand its affiliates) of such shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,\nmatters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided\nadvisory services and its opinion for the information and assistance of the Anaplan Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The\nGoldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any\nother matter.\nOpinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan\nThe Anaplan Board considered the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Anaplan Board by Qatalyst Partners at a meeting of\nthe Anaplan Board on March 20, 2022. At such meeting of the Anaplan Board, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Anaplan Board its oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications,\nlimitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point\nof view, to such holders.\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex C and is incorporated by reference\nherein. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the Anaplan Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a\nfinancial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the\nholders of shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other\naspect of the Merger. It does not\n49\nTable of Contents\nconstitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter\nand does not in any manner address the price at which Anaplan common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.\nFinancial Projections. The Anaplan Board considered the Financial Projections prepared by Anaplan\u2019s senior management team. The Anaplan\nBoard understood that these Financial Projections were based on assumptions and estimates that are difficult to project and were subject to high\nlevels of uncertainty and also significant execution risk.\nCash Consideration. The Anaplan Board considered that the form of consideration to be paid to Anaplan stockholders in the Merger was all-cash\nand considered the certainty of value compared to other forms of consideration and immediate liquidity associated with such cash consideration,\nwhile eliminating the effect of long-term industry, competitive and execution risk.\nLikelihood of Closing. The Anaplan Board concluded that the Merger would likely be consummated in an orderly manner as a result of a number\nof factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe meaningful premium over the market price of the shares of Anaplan common stock and certainty of value to Anaplan stockholders\noffered by Parent\u037e\n\u2022\nthe business reputation and significant financial resources of Parent and willingness of Parent to consummate the Merger, including\nSponsor\u2019s track record of completing acquisition transactions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Parent\u2019s proposal offered to fully fund the aggregate Merger Consideration with equity funding from the Sponsor if\nnecessary\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Parent had obtained a limited guaranty from the Sponsor guaranteeing full payment of the termination fee payable by\nParent to Anaplan in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances\u037e\n\u2022\nthe likelihood and anticipated timing of completing the proposed Merger in light of the scope of the conditions to completion,\nincluding the fact that there were no anticipated significant issues in connection with the HSR Act and other antitrust clearances and\nother regulatory approvals\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the Outside Date under the Merger Agreement is expected to allow for sufficient time to complete the Merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthat the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement are reasonable and customary in number and scope and which, in\nthe case of the condition related to the accuracy of Anaplan\u2019s representations and warranties, are generally subject to a \u201cMaterial\nAdverse Effect\u201d qualification, as described under the section captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Representations and Warranties\u201d\nbeginning on page 91\u037e and\n\u2022\nAnaplan\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent breaches\nof the Merger Agreement, and to enforce specifically the terms of the Merger Agreement, including to cause the Equity Financing\ncontemplated by Sponsor\u2019s equity commitment letter to be funded, regardless of whether Parent is able to obtain any debt financing\nfor the transaction as described under the section captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Specific Performance\u201d beginning on page 112.\nSpeed of Closing. The Anaplan Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger and concluded that, subject to the\nsatisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Merger would allow Anaplan stockholders to receive the\nconsideration in a relatively short timeframe. The Anaplan Board also determined that such a relatively short timeframe would be expected to\nreduce the uncertainty and potential disruption to Anaplan\u2019s business during the pendency of the Merger.\n50\nTable of Contents\nMerger Agreement. The Anaplan Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:\n\u2022\nAbility to Respond to Certain Unsolicited Takeover Proposals. While Anaplan is prohibited from soliciting any acquisition proposal,\nthe Merger Agreement does permit the Anaplan Board, subject to compliance with certain procedural requirements (including that the\nAnaplan Board determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that an unsolicited\nacquisition proposal would reasonably likely lead to a superior proposal), (i) to furnish information with respect to Anaplan to a\nperson making such unsolicited acquisition proposal and (ii) to participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making\nsuch unsolicited acquisition proposal.\n\u2022\nRight to Accept Superior Proposals. In the event Anaplan receives a superior proposal, the Anaplan Board may withdraw or change\nits recommendation in favor of the Merger if the Anaplan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal\ncounsel and its financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Anaplan\u2019s stockholders\nunder applicable law. In order for the Anaplan Board to withdraw or change its recommendation in connection with a superior\nproposal, the Anaplan Board must first provide Parent with a right to negotiate with Anaplan to adjust the terms and conditions of\nthe Merger Agreement so that such change in recommendation is no longer necessary. If the Anaplan Board terminates the Merger\nAgreement in order to accept a superior proposal, Anaplan must substantially concurrently pay Parent a termination fee of\n$293,122,500 in cash.\n\u2022\nChange in Recommendation for an Intervening Event. If a specified Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this Proxy\nStatement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Acquisition Proposals\u201d) occurs, the Anaplan Board may withdraw or change its\nrecommendation in favor of the Merger if the Anaplan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal\ncounsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Anaplan\u2019s stockholders under applicable law. In\norder for the Anaplan Board to withdraw or change its recommendation in connection with such an Intervening Event, the Anaplan\nBoard must first provide Parent with a right to negotiate with Anaplan to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so\nthat such change in recommendation is no longer necessary. In the event that the Anaplan Board withdraws or changes its\nrecommendation in connection with an Intervening Event, Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement, in which case Anaplan must\npay Parent a termination fee of $293,122,500 in cash within three business days after such termination.\n\u2022\nTermination Fee. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under\nspecified circumstances, including a termination by Anaplan to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to superior\nproposal, Anaplan would be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee of $293,122,500. The Anaplan Board was of the view that this\ntermination fee was comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, was reasonable in light of the bidding and\nnegotiation process that led to the execution of the Merger Agreement, as well as of the terms of the Merger Agreement itself, and\nwas necessary to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement. The Anaplan Board believed that the termination fee would not\nlikely deter or preclude another party with interest in Anaplan and financial resources sufficient to consummate an alternative\nacquisition transaction with Anaplan, were one to exist, from making a competing proposal for Anaplan and would likely only be\nrequired to be paid in the event that the Anaplan Board entered into a transaction more financially favorable to Anaplan\u2019s\nstockholders than the Merger.\n\u2022\nConditions to the Completion of the Transactions. The Anaplan Board considered the limited conditions to Parent\u2019s obligations to\nconsummate the Merger, including the condition that there not have occurred a change or event that would constitute a Material\nAdverse Effect (as defined in\n51\nTable of Contents\nthe section of this Proxy Statement captioned \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u2014Representations and Warranties\u201d) that is continuing with\nrespect to Anaplan. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that specified changes or events would be excluded from the\ndetermination whether Anaplan had experienced a Material Adverse Effect, particularly any change or event resulting from the\nannouncement, pendency and consummation of the Merger.\n\u2022\nRegulatory Undertaking by Parent. The Anaplan Board considered that the Merger is subject to a waiting period and appropriate\nregulatory clearance, and that Parent is obligated, subject to certain limitations, to use reasonable best efforts to obtain necessary\nregulatory approvals.\n\u2022\nFinancing Undertaking by Parent. The Anaplan Board considered that Sponsor provided an equity commitment for the Merger and\nthe fact that Anaplan is a named third party beneficiary in the equity commitment letter. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that\nParent\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned upon the receipt of third-party debt financing or completion of any debt\nfinancing marketing period.\n\u2022\nSpecific Performance. The Anaplan Board considered Anaplan\u2019s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of the\nMerger Agreement, including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and to cause the Equity Financing\ncontemplated by Sponsor\u2019s equity commitment letter to be funded.\n\u2022\nReverse Termination Fee. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that a reverse termination fee of $586,245,000 in cash is payable by\nParent to Anaplan in the event that Parent does not proceed to consummate the Merger in certain circumstances following\nsatisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and that such payment obligation is supported by a\nguaranty provided by Sponsor with respect to Parent\u2019s obligation to pay the reverse termination fee, indemnify and reimburse the\nCompany for specified costs and expenses incurred in cooperating with any debt financing sought by Parent and pay certain other\namounts under the Merger Agreement (as described in the below section captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Financing of the Merger\u201d).\n\u2022\nAppraisal Rights. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Anaplan\u2019s stockholders who do not vote their shares in favor of\nadoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law will be entitled to such\nappraisal rights with respect to such shares in connection with the Merger, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.\nThe Anaplan Board also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the Merger in making its determination and\nreaching its recommendation, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):\nNo Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all-cash\ntransaction means that Anaplan stockholders would no longer be able to participate in any future earnings or growth of Anaplan or benefit from\nany appreciation in the value of Anaplan following the consummation of the Merger, which earnings or growth could have resulted, if Anaplan had\nremained independent, in future prices for shares of the Anaplan common stock in excess of the Merger Consideration.\nRisk of Non-Consummation. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that, while Anaplan expects that the Merger will be consummated, there can\nbe no assurance that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied, and that, as a result, the Merger may not be consummated. The Anaplan Board\nconsidered the potential risks associated with a failure of the Merger to be consummated, including (i) the extensive time and effort expended by\nAnaplan\u2019s directors, senior management and other employees during the pendency of the proposed Merger, (ii) the significant transaction-related\ncosts and opportunity costs incurred by Anaplan, (iii) the trading price for shares of Anaplan\u2019s common stock could be negatively\n52\nTable of Contents\nimpacted, (iv) Anaplan\u2019s business could be disrupted and negatively impacted, including loss of business partners and employees, and (v) the\nmarket\u2019s perceptions of Anaplan\u2019s prospects could be adversely affected.\nRestrictions on Conduct of Business. The Anaplan Board considered the limitations on Anaplan\u2019s pursuit of business opportunities during the\npendency of the Merger due to certain covenants contained in the Merger Agreement requiring Anaplan to operate its business in the ordinary\ncourse of business consistent with past practice and, subject to specified exceptions, to comply with certain other operating restrictions. Such\nrestrictions could delay or prevent Anaplan from pursuing business opportunities that may arise during the pendency of the proposed Merger\nand/or have a significant adverse effect on Anaplan\u2019s ability to respond to changing market and business conditions, in a timely manner, or at all.\nImpact of Negotiation and Announcement. The Anaplan Board considered the impact on Anaplan\u2019s business of the negotiation and public\nannouncement of the proposed Merger, including the potentially negative effects that the negotiation and announcement may have on Anaplan\u2019s\nbusiness relationships and its ability to attract and retain key management, technical and other personnel while the Merger is pending.\nInability to Solicit Other Acquisition Proposals. The Anaplan Board considered the covenant in the Merger Agreement prohibiting Anaplan from\nsoliciting other competing acquisition proposals.\nTermination Fee. The Anaplan Board considered the possibility that the $293,122,500 termination fee could potentially dissuade a potential\nacquirer from proposing an alternative acquisition transaction that could be of greater value to Anaplan stockholders than the Merger.\nAntitrust Clearance. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that completion of the Merger is subject to antitrust clearance in the United States.\nPossible Loss of Key Management or Other Personnel. The Anaplan Board considered the risk of the possible loss of key management or other\npersonnel of Anaplan during the pendency of the Merger.\nInterests of the Board and Management. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that Anaplan\u2019s directors and officers may have financial interests\nin the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, that may be different from or in addition to those of Anaplan\u2019s\nother stockholders, and the risk that these interests might influence their decision with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement.\nTax Treatment. The Anaplan Board considered the fact that the cash consideration to be received by Anaplan stockholders in the Merger would be\ntaxable to U.S. Holders (as defined under the section captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d).\nHowever, the Anaplan Board noted that the all-cash nature of the consideration payable in the transactions contemplated by the Merger\nAgreement would provide such Anaplan stockholders with adequate cash for the payment of any taxes due.\nThe foregoing discussion of the reasons for the Anaplan Board\u2019s recommendation that Anaplan stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the\nMerger Agreement is not meant to be exhaustive, but addresses the material information and factors considered by the Anaplan Board in consideration\nof its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Anaplan Board in connection with the evaluation of the Merger and the\ncomplexity of these matters, the Anaplan Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific\nfactors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, the Anaplan Board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect\nto any of the particular factors considered. Instead, the Anaplan Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above and made its\ndeterminations and recommendations based on the totality of the information reviewed. The judgments of individual members of the Anaplan Board may\nhave been influenced to a greater or lesser degree by different factors. The Anaplan Board ultimately concluded that, in the aggregate, the potential\nbenefits of the Merger outweighed the potential risks or negative consequences of the Merger.\n53\nTable of Contents\nFor the reasons described above, the Anaplan Board unanimously recommends that Anaplan\u2019s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the\nMerger Agreement.\nOpinions of Anaplan\u2019s Financial Advisors\nOpinion of Goldman Sachs, Financial Advisor to Anaplan.\nAt a meeting of the Anaplan Board held on March 20, 2022, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its\nwritten opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the Anaplan Board that, as of the date of the written opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and\nassumptions set forth therein, the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of\nsuch shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.\nThe full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated March 20, 2022, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters\nconsidered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided advisory services\nand its opinion for the information and assistance of the Anaplan Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion\nis not a recommendation as to how any holder of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other matter.\nIn connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other\nthings:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nAnaplan\u2019s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated October 10, 2018, relating to Anaplan\u2019s\ninitial public offering\u037e\n\u2022\nannual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Anaplan for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2021\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Anaplan\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain other communications from Anaplan to its stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\ncertain publicly available research analyst reports for Anaplan\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Financial Projections prepared by Anaplan\u2019s management and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by Anaplan.\nGoldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Anaplan regarding their assessment of the past and current\nbusiness operations, financial condition and future prospects of Anaplan\u037e reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Anaplan\ncommon stock\u037e compared certain financial and stock market information for Anaplan with similar information for certain other companies the securities of\nwhich are publicly traded\u037e reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the software industry\u037e and performed such other\nstudies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.\nFor purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Anaplan Board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and\ncompleteness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without\nassuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Anaplan Board that the\nFinancial Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of Anaplan.\nGoldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-\nbalance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Anaplan or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.\n54\nTable of Contents\nGoldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be\nobtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to Goldman Sachs\u2019 analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed\nthat the Merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the\neffect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Anaplan to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger\nas compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Anaplan\u037e nor did it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of its opinion, to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates)\nof shares of Anaplan common stock, of the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan common stock to be paid to the holders of such shares pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or\nthe Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection\nwith the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of\nsecurities, creditors, or other constituencies of Anaplan\u037e nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any\nof the officers, directors or employees of Anaplan, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the $66.00 in cash per\nshare of Anaplan common stock to be paid to the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman\nSachs\u2019 opinion did not express any opinion as to the prices at which the shares of Anaplan common stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects\nof volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on Anaplan, Parent or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of\nAnaplan or Parent or the ability of Anaplan or Parent to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was necessarily\nbased on economic, monetary market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion and\nGoldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring\nafter the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Anaplan Board in\nconnection with its consideration of the Merger and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Anaplan\ncommon stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman\nSachs.\nSummary of Material Financial Analyses\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs to the Anaplan Board in connection with rendering to\nthe Anaplan Board the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial\nanalyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by\nGoldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with\nthe full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following\nquantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before March 18, 2022, the last trading\nday before the public announcement of the Merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.\nImplied Transaction Premia and Multiples Analysis\nBased on the closing price of $50.59 per share of Anaplan common stock on March 18, 2022, the last trading day prior to March 20, 2022, the date\non which Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Anaplan Board, Goldman Sachs calculated the following premia:\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the closing price of Anaplan common stock on March 18, 2022\u037e\n55\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the closing price of Anaplan common stock on March 8, 2022, the initial bid date\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the intraday price of Anaplan common stock immediately prior to the first report of a potential\nactivist investor stockholding in Anaplan on February 24, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the closing price of Anaplan Common Stock on March 17, 2022, the date that Sachem Head and\nCorvex filed their respective Schedule 13D for Anaplan common stock\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the price of Anaplan common stock immediately prior to the filing of Anaplan\u2019s financial results\nfor the fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 on March 2, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the volume weighted average prices of Anaplan common stock over the ten-day period ended\nMarch 18, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the volume weighted average prices (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of Anaplan common stock over the thirty-day\nperiod ended March 18, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the highest closing price of Anaplan common stock achieved during the 52-week period ended\non March 18, 2022\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Merger Consideration as a premium to the lowest closing price of Anaplan common stock achieved during the 52-week period ended on\nMarch 18, 2022\u037e\nThe results of these analyses are summarized as follows:\nPremium to\nCurrent Price\n30%\nInitial Bid Date Price\n47%\nPre-Activist Rumors Price\n52%\nPre-Schedule 13D Filings Price\n40%\nPre-Earnings Price\n41%\n10-Day VWAP\n44%\n30-Day VWAP\n42%\n52-Week High\n(3)%\n52-Week Low\n62%\nIllustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\nUsing the Financial Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Anaplan to derive a range of illustrative\npresent values per share of Anaplan common stock. Using the mid-year convention for cash flows and discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%,\nreflecting estimates of Anaplan\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of January 31, 2022 (i) estimates of\nunlevered free cash flow for Anaplan, as reflected in the Financial Projections and referred to as \u201cUnlevered Free Cash Flow (Less Stock Based\nCompensation and Excluding Cash Tax Savings from NOLs)\u201d in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned \u201cThe Merger\u2014Certain Financial\nProjections,\u201d for the years 2023 through 2032 and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Anaplan, which were calculated by applying an illustrative\nrange of terminal year multiples ranging from 30.0x to 40.0x, to an estimated terminal year next twelve months, or \u201cNTM,\u201d unlevered free cash flow to be\ngenerated by Anaplan, as provided by management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of Anaplan. Based on the\nforegoing, Goldman Sachs also calculated implied terminal value to NTM revenue multiples which ranged from 4.1x to 5.4x. Goldman Sachs derived such\ndiscount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or the \u201cCAPM\u201d, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the\ncompany\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash\ntax rate\n56\nTable of Contents\nand a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of terminal year multiples was\nestimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current enterprise value to unlevered free cash flow\nmultiples of certain selected scaled software companies, as described below in the section captioned \u201c\u2014Selected Public Company Comparables\u201d.\nGoldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for Anaplan by adding the ranges of present values it derived as described above.\nGoldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Anaplan the net debt of Anaplan as of January 31, 2022 and\nadded the net present value of cash tax savings from federal net operating losses, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman\nSachs\u2019 use by management of Anaplan, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Anaplan. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative\nequity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Anaplan, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of Anaplan, calculated using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of\nAnaplan common stock ranging from $52.00 to $80.71.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis\nGoldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of Anaplan common stock,\nwhich is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company\u2019s equity as a function of such company\u2019s\nestimated future NTM revenue and assumed one-year forward enterprise value to revenue multiples. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Financial\nProjections for each of the fiscal years 2024 through 2026. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise values for Anaplan as of January 31 for\neach of the years 2023 to 2025 by applying enterprise value to NTM revenue multiples of 8.0x to 12.0x to revenue estimates contained in the Financial\nProjections for each of the fiscal years 2024 to 2026. These illustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional\njudgment and experience, taking into account current and historical enterprise value to NTM revenue multiples for Anaplan and certain selected growth\nsoftware companies, as described in the section below captioned \u201c\u2014Selected Public Company Comparables.\u201d Goldman Sachs then subtracted the\namount of Anaplan\u2019s forecasted net debt (defined as gross financial debt less cash) as of January 31, 2023 to 2025, each as provided by the management\nof Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Anaplan, from the range of implied enterprise values to derive a range of\nillustrative equity values for Anaplan as of January 31 of each of the years 2023 to 2025. Goldman Sachs then divided the results by the number of\nprojected fully diluted shares of Anaplan common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method, as of January 31 of each of the years 2023 to 2025,\nrespectively, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by the management of Anaplan, to derive a range of\nimplied future equity values per share. Goldman Sachs then discounted these implied equity values per share back to January 31, 2022 using an\nillustrative discount rate of 11.8% to derive implied present values of future shares prices as of January 31, 2022. The illustrative discount rate of 11.8%\nreflected an estimate of Anaplan\u2019s cost of equity. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This\nanalysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Anaplan common stock of $46.14 to $87.94.\nSelected Transactions Analysis\nGoldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to the following selected transactions in the software industry announced\nbetween 2016 and 2021. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the estimated transaction enterprise value, which is (x) the\nannounced per share consideration paid or payable in the applicable transaction multiplied by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of the target\ncompany plus (y) the net debt of the target company, in each case based on data obtained from public filings. Goldman Sachs then calculated and\ncompared the estimated transaction enterprise value (x) as a multiple of the target\u2019s estimated NTM revenue from the announcement date of the\ntransaction (which\n57\nTable of Contents\nwe refer to as the \u201cNTM revenue multiple\u201d) and (y) as a growth-adjusted multiple of the target\u2019s estimated NTM revenue from the announcement date of\nthe transaction (which we refer to as the \u201cgrowth-adjusted NTM revenue multiple\u201d), in each case based on Institutional Broker\u2019s Estimate System\nconsensus estimates and Wall Street Research.\nAnnouncement\nDate\nAcquirer\nTarget\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiple\nApril 2016\nVista Equity Partners Management,\nLLC\nCvent, Inc.\n6.5x\nMay 2016\nVista Equity Partners Management,\nLLC\nMarketo, Inc.\n5.9x\nJune 2016\nsalesforce.com, inc.\nDemandware, Inc.\n8.9x\nJune 2016\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nQlik Technologies Inc.\n3.6x\nJuly 2016\nOracle Corporation\nNetSuite Inc.\n9.1x\nDecember 2017\nOracle Corporation\nAconex Limited\n8.1x\nJanuary 2018\nSAP SE\nCallidus Software Inc.\n8.3x\nMarch 2018\nsalesforce.com, inc.\nMuleSoft, Inc.\n15.7x\nOctober 2018\nTwilio Inc.\nSendGrid, Inc.\n11.5x\nNovember 2018\nVista Equity Partners Management,\nLLC\nApptio Inc.\n7.0x\nNovember 2018\nVeritas Capital Fund Management,\nL.L.C. & Evergreen Coast Capital\nCorp.\nathenahealth, Inc.\n3.9x\nFebruary 2019\nHellman & Friedman LLC\nThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc.\n8.4x\nDecember 2019\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nInstructure Holdings, Inc.\n6.5x\nDecember 2020\nsalesforce.com, inc.\nSlack Technologies, Inc.\n28.4x\nDecember 2020\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nRealPage, Inc.\n8.2x\nMarch 2021\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nTalend S.A.\n7.4x\nApril 2021\nMicrosoft Corporation\nNuance Communications, Inc.\n14.2x\nApril 2021\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nProofpoint Inc.\n9.4x\nJuly 2021\nThoma Bravo, L.P.\nMedallia, Inc.\n10.8x\nDecember 2021\nSS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nBlue Prism Group PLC\n5.8x\nWhile none of the selected transactions or companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Merger or\nAnaplan, the companies that participated in the selected transactions are companies with operations, results, market sizes and product profiles that, for\nthe purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of those of Anaplan.\nThe foregoing analysis indicated an overall median NTM revenue multiple for the selected transactions of 8.2x, a median NTM revenue multiple for\nthe selected transactions involving a strategic acquirer of 9.1x and a median NTM revenue multiple for the selected transactions involving a financial\nacquirer of 7.0x. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative NTM revenue\nmultiples of 8.0x to 12.0x to the next twelve months revenue of Anaplan reflected in the Financial Projections to derive a range of implied enterprise values\nfor Anaplan. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of implied enterprise values the net debt for Anaplan as of January 31, 2022, as provided by\nthe management of Anaplan and approved for Goldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of Anaplan, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for\nAnaplan. Goldman Sachs divided the results by the number of fully diluted\n58\nTable of Contents\noutstanding shares of Anaplan common stock, calculated using the treasury stock method, as provided by the management of Anaplan and approved for\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 use by management of Anaplan, to derive a range of implied values per share of Anaplan common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar, of\n$42 to $62.\nPremia Paid Analysis\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for 142 all-cash acquisition transactions\nannounced from 2012 through February 2022, involving a public technology, media or telecommunication company based in the United States as the\ntarget where the disclosed enterprise value for the transaction was greater than $1 billion. For the entire period, using publicly available information,\nGoldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premia of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target\u2019s last closing\nstock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 28% across the period. This analysis also indicated a\n25th percentile premium of 18% and 75th percentile premium of 44% across the period. Using this analysis and its professional judgment and experience,\nGoldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 18% to 44% to the undisturbed closing price per share of Anaplan common stock of\n$50.59 as of March 18, 2022 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share of Anaplan common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar, of $60 to\n$73.\nSelected Public Company Comparables\nGoldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following high-growth publicly traded corporations in\nthe software industry, which are collectively referred to as the \u201cselected growth software companies\u201d:\n\u2022\nBill.com Holdings, Inc.\n\u2022\nOkta, Inc.\n\u2022\nWorkiva Inc.\n\u2022\nCoupa Software Incorporated\n\u2022\nAvalara, Inc.\n\u2022\nBlackLine, Inc.\n\u2022\nSmartsheet Inc.\n\u2022\nDocuSign, Inc.\n\u2022\nTwilio Inc.\nGoldman Sachs also reviewed and compared certain financial and stock market information for the following publicly traded corporations in the\nmature software industry, which are collectively referred to as the \u201cselected scaled software companies\u201d:\n\u2022\nWorkday, Inc.\n\u2022\nServiceNow, Inc.\n\u2022\nIntuit Inc.\n\u2022\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\u2022\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\u2022\nSalesforce, Inc.\n\u2022\nAdobe Inc.\n\u2022\nAutodesk, Inc.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe selected growth software companies and the selected scaled software companies are collectively referred to as the \u201ccomparable companies.\u201d\nAlthough none of the comparable companies is directly comparable to Anaplan, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded\ncompanies in the growth software industry and scaled software industry, respectively, with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered\nsimilar to certain operations of Anaplan.\nGoldman Sachs calculated and compared (i) the enterprise value as of March 18, 2022 as a multiple of revenue for Anaplan and the selected growth\nsoftware companies for calendar year 2022 and (ii) the enterprise value as of March 18, 2022 as a multiple of unlevered free cash flows for calendar year\n2022, in each case based on financial and trading data as of March 18, 2022 and information from Wall Street Research, publicly available historical and\nmarket data and IBES estimates.\nThe results of this analysis are summarized as follows:\nSelected Growth Software Companies\nNTM\nRevenue\nMultiples\nBill.com Holdings, Inc.\n32.3x\nOkta, Inc.\n15.9x\nWorkiva Inc.\n10.7x\nCoupa Software Incorporated\n10.0x\nAvalara, Inc.\n9.0x\nBlackLine, Inc.\n8.9x\nSmartsheet Inc.\n8.5x\nDocuSign, Inc.\n7.9x\nTwilio Inc.\n6.4x\nAnaplan (based on Wall Street Research and publicly available information)\n10.1x\nSelected Scaled Software Companies\nEnterprise\nValue /\nUnlevered\nFree\nCash Flow\nMultiples\nWorkday, Inc.\n54.4x\nServiceNow, Inc.\n47.2x\nIntuit Inc.\n42.5x\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.\n40.4x\nMicrosoft Corporation\n32.8x\nSalesforce, Inc.\n31.7x\nAdobe Inc.\n30.6x\nAutodesk, Inc.\n21.7x\nGeneral\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting\nportions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and\ndid not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis\nof its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a\ncomparison is directly comparable to Anaplan or the Merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Anaplan Board as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of shares of Anaplan common stock of the $66.00 in cash per share of Anaplan\ncommon stock to be paid to such\n60\nTable of Contents\nholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses\nor securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon\nnumerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Anaplan, Parent, Goldman Sachs or any other person\nassumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe Merger Consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Anaplan and Parent and was approved by the Anaplan\nBoard. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Anaplan during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific merger\nconsideration to Anaplan or the Anaplan Board or that any specific merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Anaplan Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Anaplan Board in\nmaking its determination to approve the Merger. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by\nGoldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as\nAnnex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment\nmanagement and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 24, 2022, Anaplan engaged Goldman Sachs\nto act as one of its financial advisors in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between Anaplan and Goldman Sachs provides for a\ntransaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $56 million, $3 million of which\nbecame payable upon the presentation by Goldman Sachs to the Anaplan Board of the final results of the study Goldman Sachs undertook to determine\nwhether it was able to render a fairness opinion in connection with the Merger Consideration and the delivery of its opinion, and the remainder of which\nis contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, Anaplan has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including\nattorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the\nfederal securities laws.\nOpinion of Qatalyst Partners, Financial Advisor to Anaplan\nAnaplan retained Qatalyst Partners to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with a potential transaction such as the Merger and to\nevaluate whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of\nshares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Anaplan selected\nQatalyst Partners to act as Anaplan\u2019s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners\u2019 qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business\nand affairs of Anaplan and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this\nProxy Statement. At the meeting of the Anaplan Board on March 20, 2022, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Anaplan Board its oral opinion,\nsubsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications,\nlimitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger\nAgreement by the holders of shares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such\nholders. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, to the Anaplan Board following the meeting of the Anaplan Board.\nThe full text of Qatalyst Partners\u2019 written opinion, dated March 20, 2022, is attached hereto as Annex C and is incorporated by reference herein.\nThe opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the\nreview undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. The holders of Anaplan common stock should read the opinion carefully in its\nentirety. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion was provided to the Anaplan Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial\npoint of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of\nshares of Anaplan common stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger.\nIt does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Anaplan common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other\nmatter and does not in any manner address the price at which Anaplan common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time. The summary\nof Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this Proxy\nStatement as Annex C.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, certain related documents and certain publicly available\nfinancial statements and other business and financial information of Anaplan. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the Financial Projections prepared by the\nmanagement of Anaplan described in the section below captioned \u201c\u2014Projected Financial Information.\u201d Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the\npast and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Anaplan with senior management of Anaplan. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed\nthe historical market prices and trading activity for Anaplan common stock and compared the financial performance of Anaplan and the prices and trading\nactivity\n62\nTable of Contents\nof Anaplan common stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the\nfinancial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information\nand considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.\nIn arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Anaplan. With respect to the\nFinancial Projections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by the management of Anaplan, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with the\nmanagement and board of Anaplan, that the Financial Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of the management of Anaplan of the future financial performance of Anaplan and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners\nassumed that the terms of the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed Merger\nAgreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver\nor delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the Merger, no delays, limitations,\nconditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on Anaplan or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the\nMerger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Anaplan or its\naffiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent\nverification, upon the assessment of the management of Anaplan as to the existing and future technology and products of Anaplan and the risks\nassociated with such technology and products.

Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion and the assumptions\nused in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners\u2019 opinion does not\naddress the underlying business decision of Anaplan to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic\nalternatives that may be available to Anaplan.

Except as noted hereafter or in the section of this Proxy Statement\ncaptioned \u201cTreatment of Equity-Based Awards\u201d, no payments, benefits or acceleration of vesting of payments or benefits will be triggered solely upon\nthe occurrence of a change in control, unless an acquirer does not assume or substitute a comparable award for an outstanding equity award or a named\nexecutive officer is subject to a qualifying termination during the change in control period beginning three (3) months before and up to twelve (12)\nmonths after a qualified change in control, or 18 months in case of our CEO (the \u201cCiC Period\u201d) (a so-called \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d arrangement).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any performance-based equity held by a named executive officer will be treated as provided below. Generally, in the case\nof the acceleration of vesting of outstanding equity awards, we use this \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d arrangement to protect against the loss of retention value\nfollowing a change in control and to avoid windfalls, both of which could occur if vesting of either equity or cash-based awards accelerated automatically\nas a result of the transaction. In the event such executive officers is subject to a qualifying termination during a CiC Period, each such executive would be\n73\nTable of Contents\nentitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to 12 months of such executive\u2019s base salary, target bonus, and COBRA payments, as well as 100%\nacceleration of any unvested equity held at the time of termination, with any performance goals deemed achieved at the greater of 100% of target or actual\nperformance.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing and other than with respect to any outstanding performance-based equity, under the terms of his Post-Employment\nCompensation Agreement with us, if Mr. Calderoni remains employed through the occurrence of a change in control, then 50% of his then-unvested\nshares subject to his outstanding equity awards will immediately vest, and in the case of Company Stock Options become immediately exercisable, and if\nhe remains in continuous service with us through the one-year anniversary of a change in control, then 100% of his then-unvested shares subject to\nsuch outstanding equity awards will immediately vest, and in the case of Company Stock Options become immediately exercisable. In addition, if Mr.\nCalderoni is terminated during the CiC Period, he would be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to 18 months of such executive\u2019s base salary,\ntarget bonus, and COBRA payments, as well as 100% acceleration of any unvested equity held at the time of termination, with any performance goals\ndeemed achieved at the greater of 100% of target or actual performance.\nWith respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Schuh in December 2020, the applicable award agreement provides that\nif Mr. Schuh is subject to a qualifying termination during the CIC Period, the award will vest in full, and the performance condition will be deemed\nachieved at the greater of actual performance or target achievement.\nWith respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to each of Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh in February 2021, the applicable award\nagreements provide that if Mrs. Pinczuk or Mr. Schuh remains in continuous service through a change of control, a pro rata portion of their awards will\nvest immediately prior to the change in control, with the performance condition deemed achieved based on actual performance and the extent to which\nthey have satisfied the service condition through such date, and an additional portion of the awards will vest on January 31, 2024, based on actual\nperformance through the change in control, subject to Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh remaining in continuous service through such vesting date. In\naddition, if such executive officer were to be subject to a qualifying termination during the CiC Period, the vesting described above for each of their\nperformance-based awards would occur upon such termination, with the performance condition deemed achieved based on the greater of actual\nperformance or target achievement.\nWith respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to each of Mrs. Pinczuk and Mr. Schuh in September 2021, and the\nperformance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Mehta in July 2021, the applicable award agreements provide that if such executive remains in\ncontinuous service through a change of control, a portion of their awards will vest on each of the remaining quarterly installment dates, with the\nperformance condition deemed achieved based on actual performance through the change in control, subject to such executive officer remaining in\ncontinuous service through each such vesting date. In addition, if such executive officer were to be subject to a qualifying termination during the CiC\nPeriod, the vesting described above for each of their performance-based awards would occur upon such termination, with the performance condition\ndeemed achieved based on the greater of actual performance or target achievement. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Mrs. Pinczuk\u2019s, Mr. Schuh\u2019s,\nand Mr. Mehta\u2019s performance-based equity awards, if they become eligible for more favorable vesting acceleration provisions pursuant to any other\nwritten agreement with the Company, including a severance and change in control agreement, the more favorable terms in such other agreement shall\napply instead of the acceleration terms in the aforementioned performance-based equity agreements.\nWith respect to the performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Calderoni in February 2021, the applicable award agreement provides\nthat if Mr. Calderoni remains in continuous service through a change in control transaction, then 50% of his award, to the extent the performance\ncondition was satisfied, will vest immediately prior to the change in control, and the remaining 50% of the award, to the extent the performance condition\nwas satisfied, will vest if Mr. Calderoni remains in continuous service through the first anniversary of the closing of the change in control, with the\nperformance condition deemed achieved based on actual\n74\nTable of Contents\nperformance through the change in control. In addition, if Mr. Calderoni were to be subject to a qualifying termination during the CiC Period, the vesting\ndescribed above would occur upon such termination.\nIn addition, for the aforementioned executives, to the extent either the terms provided under the Merger Agreement or the terms of his or her\nperformance-based award agreement or other written agreement with the Company provides for more favorable treatment with respect to the achievement\nof a performance or vesting condition or the timing of payments in connection with or following a change in control, such more favorable terms shall\napply.\nGolden Parachute Compensation\nIn accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger\nthat will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

        "Section Text": "Appraisal Rights\nIf the Merger Agreement is adopted by Anaplan\u2019s stockholders, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger\nAgreement and who properly exercise and perfect their demand for appraisal of their shares in accordance with Section 262 will be entitled to appraisal\nrights in connection with the Merger.\nThe following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the\nfull text of Section 262, which is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor\ndoes it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Anaplan\ncommon stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Anaplan\ncommon stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to\nfollow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Anaplan common stock through\na broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee.\nUnder Section 262, holders of shares of Anaplan common stock who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, who\ncontinuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time, and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be\nentitled to the appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair value of their shares of Anaplan common stock, exclusive of any element of value\narising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value of\nthe shares from the effective date of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. At any time before the entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter\nonly upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.\n79Table of Contents\nUnder Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty\n(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a\ncopy of Section 262. This Proxy Statement constitutes Anaplan\u2019s notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the\nMerger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement. In connection with the Merger, any holder of Anaplan common\nstock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder\u2019s right to do so, should review Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly\ncomply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who\nloses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the\ncomplexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Anaplan common stock, Anaplan believes that if a stockholder is\nconsidering exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.\nStockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Anaplan common stock must do ALL of the following:\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must NOT vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but\ndoes not otherwise contain voting instructions will be, unless revoked, voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder\nwho votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, abstain or\nnot vote its shares\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must deliver to Anaplan a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at\nthe Special Meeting\u037e\n\u2022\nthe stockholder must continuously hold the shares of Anaplan common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective\nTime. A stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file\nany such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of Anaplan\nstockholders to take all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Anaplan common stock within the time\nprescribed in Section 262.\nFiling Written Demand\nAny holder of shares of Anaplan common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Anaplan, before the vote on the adoption of\nthe Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written\ndemand for the appraisal of the stockholder\u2019s shares, and that stockholder must not submit a blank proxy or vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the\nMerger Agreement. A holder of shares of Anaplan common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the\nwritten demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not\ncontain voting instructions will be, unless revoked, voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the\nstockholder\u2019s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and\nwho wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, or\nabstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights may instead not vote its\nshares. However, neither voting against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to\nadopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written\ndemand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger\n80\nTable of Contents\nAgreement. A proxy or vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will not constitute such a written demand. A stockholder\u2019s failure to\nmake the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of Anaplan stockholders\nwill constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\nOnly a holder of record of shares of Anaplan common stock is entitled to demand appraisal for the shares registered in that holder\u2019s name. A\ndemand for appraisal in respect of shares of Anaplan common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably\ninform Anaplan of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u2019s shares in connection with the\nMerger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on\nbehalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand\nmust be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint owners, may execute a\ndemand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record\u037e however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in\nexecuting the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.\nSTOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS, AND WHO WISH TO\nEXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKERS, BANKS AND NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE\nAPPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE HOLDER TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE\nSHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A\nBROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY\nMANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.\nAll written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to Anaplan, Inc., 50 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco,\nCalifornia 94105, Attention: Corporate Secretary, and must be delivered before the vote on the Merger Agreement is taken at the Special Meeting and\nshould be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of Anaplan common stock.\nAny holder of Anaplan common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement by delivering to Anaplan a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Merger.\nHowever, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving\nCorporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and\nsuch approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.\nNotice by the Surviving Corporation\nIf the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of Anaplan common\nstock who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become\neffective and the effective date thereof.\nFiling a Petition for Appraisal\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of Anaplan common\nstock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition\nin the Delaware\n81\nTable of Contents\nCourt of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair\nvalue of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file\na petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of\nshares of Anaplan common stock. Accordingly, any holders of Anaplan common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all\nnecessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Anaplan common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section\n262. The failure of a holder of Anaplan common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder\u2019s\nprevious written demand for appraisal.\nWithin one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of Anaplan common stock who has complied with the requirements for\nexercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate\nnumber of shares not voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Anaplan has received demands for\nappraisal and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within\nten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for\nappraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person\u2019s\nown name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for\nappraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.\nIf a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Anaplan common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving\nCorporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list\ncontaining the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a\nhearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal thereunder. The\nDelaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. In addition, because shares of Anaplan common stock are listed on a\nnational securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to\nappraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of Anaplan common stock,\n(2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to\nSection 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL (which deal with short-form mergers).\nDetermination of Fair Value\nAfter determining the holders of Anaplan common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the fair value of the\nshares of Anaplan common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest,\nif any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all\nrelevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the\ndate of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any\ntime before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in\nwhich case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as\nwhich case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as\n82\nTable of Contents\ndetermined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme\nCourt of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that \u201cproof of value by any\ntechniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court\u201d should be considered,\nand that \u201c[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.\u201d The Delaware Supreme Court stated that,\nin making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise\nand any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262\nprovides that fair value is to be \u201cexclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.\u201d In Cede & Co. v.\nTechnicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a \u201cnarrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,\u201d\nbut which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of\nDelaware also stated that \u201celements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the\nMerger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.\u201d\nStockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\ncould be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares\nand that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an\nopinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Anaplan believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no\nrepresentation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should\nrecognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither\nAnaplan nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder of Anaplan exercising appraisal rights, and each of\nAnaplan and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the fair value of a share of Anaplan\ncommon stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the\nappraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys\u2019 fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery\nand taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.\nIf any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of Anaplan common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses, his or her appraisal\nrights, or successfully withdraws such demand for appraisal, the stockholder\u2019s shares of Anaplan common stock will be deemed to have been converted\nat the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration applicable to the shares, less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail\nto perfect, or lose, his or her appraisal rights, or effectively withdraw a demand for appraisal, if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred twenty\n(120) days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder\u2019s demand for appraisal\nand an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Anaplan common stock for any\npurpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder\u2019s shares of\nAnaplan common stock, if any, payable to stockholders of Anaplan of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time\u037e provided, however, that, if no\npetition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an\nacceptance of the Merger, either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then\nthe right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the\n83\nTable of Contents\nappraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder of Anaplan without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nFailure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder\u2019s statutory appraisal rights.\nConsequently, any stockholder of Anaplan wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those\nrights.",

        "Section Text": "Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\nAnaplan and Parent have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all\nregulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include (i)\nthe expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act\u037e and (ii) any other required approvals under any foreign or other\nantitrust law (although the parties do not currently believe any such other required approvals exist).\nHSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters\nUnder the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Anaplan and Parent file a notification and report\nform with the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) under the HSR Act and the\napplicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of the\nwaiting period following the parties\u2019 filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a thirty (30)-day period) or the early termination of that\nwaiting period. Anaplan and Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on April 1, 2022, the 30-day waiting\nperiod with respect to which is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday, May 2, 2022.\nAt any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the\nDOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of\nthe Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing\nrelationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period\nunder the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the\ncompletion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or\nterminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain\ncircumstances.\nOther Regulatory Approvals\nAlthough the parties believe that approval under the HSR Act is the only regulatory approval required in connection with the Merger, one or more\ngovernmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents.\nThird parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could\nsignificantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of\nthe required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the\napproval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.\nAlthough we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances\nand approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all, or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of\nadditional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.",

The terms and conditions of the Merger are\nmore fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nYou have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the\nMerger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the \u201cHolders\u201d), is fair, from a\nfinancial point of view, to such Holders.\nFor purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated March 20, 2022 (the \u201cDraft Merger\nAgreement\u201d), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company.\nWe have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial\nprojections and operating data of the Company (the \u201cCompany Projections\u201d).

We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ\nmaterially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of\nthe proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the\ncontemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger.
