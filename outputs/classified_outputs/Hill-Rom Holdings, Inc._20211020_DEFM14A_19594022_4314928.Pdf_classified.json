After the expiration of the initial waiting period (or the re-started initial\nwaiting period), the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC may issue a Request for Additional Information and\nDocumentary Material (a \u201cSecond Request\u201d).

Neither Hillrom nor Baxter received any inquiries\nfrom the FTC or DOJ during the waiting period. On October 13, 2021, the FTC sent a form letter to Hillrom and Baxter\nindicating that, while the waiting period has expired, the FTC reserves its right to take further action with respect to\nthe transaction, including challenging its consummation before or after the fact.

As of October 13, 2021, the\nparties have submitted their initial filings for all required regulatory approvals (including in the European Union).\nOther state or foreign antitrust, competition and foreign investment authorities may take action under the laws of\ntheir jurisdictions, which could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger.

You are encouraged to obtain\ncurrent market prices of Hillrom common stock in connection with voting your shares of Hillrom common stock.\n1\n1TABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhat will happen in the merger?\nA:\nIf the merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Hillrom, whereupon the separate existence of\nMerger Sub will cease and Hillrom will be the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of\nBaxter. As a result of the merger, Hillrom common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer\nhave any interest in the future earnings or growth of Hillrom or Baxter. In addition, Hillrom common stock will be\ndelisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Hillrom will no longer be required to file\nperiodic reports with the SEC with respect to Hillrom common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable\nlaw, rules and regulations.\nQ:\nWho will own Hillrom after the merger?\nA:\nImmediately following the merger, Hillrom will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter.\nQ:\nWhat will I receive in the merger?\nA:\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of\nHillrom common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded\nshares) will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration of cash in the amount of\n$156.00, without interest.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the merger agreement?\nA:\nThe proposal to approve the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of Hillrom common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. A failure to vote your shares\nof Hillrom common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the\nproposal to approve the merger agreement.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal?\nA:\nThe approval of the adjournment proposal requires the votes cast favoring such action to exceed the votes cast\nopposing such action. A failure to vote your shares of Hillrom common stock or an abstention from voting will\nhave no effect on the adjournment proposal.\nQ:\nWhat vote is required to approve (on a non-binding, advisory basis) the named executive officer merger-\nrelated compensation proposal?\nA:\nThe approval of the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal requires the votes cast\nfavoring such action to exceed the votes cast opposing such action. A failure to vote your shares of Hillrom\ncommon stock or an abstention from voting will have no effect on the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation proposal.\nQ:\nWhy am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that\nmay be paid or become payable to Hillrom\u2019s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to\nthe merger?\nA:\nThe SEC rules require Hillrom to seek approval on a non-binding, advisory basis with respect to certain\npayments that will or may be made to Hillrom\u2019s named executive officers in connection with the merger. For\nadditional information, see the section entitled \u201cAdvisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related\nCompensation Arrangements (Proposal 3).\u201d\nQ:\nWhat will happen if Hillrom shareholders do not approve the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation proposal?\nA:\nThe vote to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and\napart from the vote to approve the merger agreement. Approval of the named executive officer merger-related\ncompensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning\nthat it will not be binding on Hillrom. Accordingly, while the Hillrom Board intends to consider the vote resulting\nfrom this proposal, if the merger is completed, then the compensation that is related to the merger will be payable\nto the extent that Hillrom is contractually obligated to pay such compensation, regardless of the outcome of the\nadvisory vote.\n12\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQ:\nWhen do you expect the merger to be completed?\nA:\nIn order to complete the merger, Hillrom must obtain the shareholder approval described in this proxy statement\nand the other closing conditions under the merger agreement, including receipt of required regulatory approvals,\nmust be satisfied or waived. The parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the merger in early\n2022, although Hillrom cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Because the merger is subject to\na number of conditions, the exact timing of the merger cannot be determined at this time.\nQ:\nWhat are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger?\nA:\nThe exchange of Hillrom common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income\nTax Consequences of the Merger\u201d) who receives cash in the merger in exchange for shares of Hillrom common\nstock will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in\nsuch shares.\nYou should read the section entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger\u201d and\nconsult your tax adviser regarding the particular tax consequences of the merger to you, including any tax\nconsequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.\nQ:\nWho is entitled to vote at the special meeting?\nA:\nThe record date for the special meeting is October 18, 2021. Only common shareholders of record at the close of\nbusiness on that date are entitled to attend in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means\nof remote communication, virtually, and vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement\nthereof. Each share of Hillrom common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters that come before the meeting.\nQ:\nWho may attend the special meeting?\nA:\nCommon shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 18, 2021, or their duly appointed proxies,\nmay attend the meeting. \u201cStreet name\u201d holders (those whose shares are held through a broker, bank or other\nnominee) should bring a copy of an account statement reflecting their ownership of Hillrom common stock as of\nthe record date.

We intend to limit attendance to shareholders as of the record\ndate. All shareholders should bring photo identification. Cameras, recording devices, and other electronic\ndevices are not permitted at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWho is soliciting my vote?\nA:\nThe Hillrom Board is soliciting your proxy, and Hillrom will bear the cost of soliciting proxies.

Innisfree will be paid\napproximately $25,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other\nadvisory services in connection with the special meeting. Solicitation initially will be made by mail.

After the merger is completed, you will\nreceive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written\ninstructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates or book-entry shares\nfor the per share merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by your broker,\nbank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action,\nif any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your \u201cstreet name\u201d shares in exchange for the per share merger\nconsideration.\nQ:\nShould I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?\nA:\nNo. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common\nstock now or with your proxy card. If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a\nletter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock for the\nper share merger consideration.\nQ:\nHow many shares must be present to constitute a quorum for the meeting?\nA:\nThe presence at the special meeting, in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of\nremote communication, virtually, or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Hillrom common stock issued and\noutstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for\nbusiness to be conducted at the special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the special meeting will\nnecessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject Hillrom to additional expense.\nQ:\nWhat if I abstain from voting?\nA:\nIf you attend the special meeting or send in your signed proxy card, but abstain from voting on any proposal,\nyour shares will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Abstentions and a failure\nto vote your shares of Hillrom common stock (including the failure of a record owner to execute and return a\nproxy card and the failure of a beneficial owner of shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d by a broker to give voting\ninstructions to the broker) will have the same effect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the merger\nagreement. Neither abstentions nor a failure to vote your shares of Hillrom common stock will have an effect on\nthe outcome of the adjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.\nFor shares of Hillrom common stock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d only shares of Hillrom common stock affirmatively\nvoted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.\nQ:\nWill my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card or vote by telephone or over the Internet or\nin person?\nA:\nIf you are a registered shareholder and you do not sign and return your proxy card or vote by telephone, over\nthe Internet or in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of remote communication,\nvirtually, your shares will not be voted at the special meeting and will not be counted for purposes of\ndetermining whether a quorum exists.\n15\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIf your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your broker may vote\nyour shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under\nNYSE rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters. Accordingly, if your shares are\nheld in \u201cstreet name\u201d and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted at the\nspecial meeting and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.\nYou will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration if the merger is approved and completed\neven if your shares are not voted at the special meeting.\nQ:\nWhat is a broker non-vote?\nA:\nBroker non-votes are shares held by brokers that are present in person, or, in the event that the special meeting\nis held by means of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to\nwhich the broker is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal\nand the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers do not have\ndiscretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a\nbeneficial owner of shares of Hillrom common stock held in \u201cstreet name\u201d does not give voting instructions to\nthe broker, then those shares will not be present in person, or, in the event that the special meeting is held by\nmeans of remote communication, virtually, or by proxy at the special meeting. For shares of Hillrom common\nstock held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d only shares of common stock affirmatively voted \u201cFOR\u201d the proposal to approve\nthe merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal. Broker non-votes will have the same\neffect as a vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the proposal to approve the merger agreement and will have no effect on the\nadjournment proposal or the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.\nQ:\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nA:\nThis means you own shares of Hillrom common stock that are registered under different names or are in more\nthan one account. For example, you may own some shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares\nthrough a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive\nmultiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions\nfor any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares\nyou own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by\nmail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.\nQ:\nWill my shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes\nwith shares I hold of record?\nA:\nNo. Because any shares you may hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than\nany shares you hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you\nhold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as\ntrustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy\ncard for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation\nor business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement\naccount must be voted under the rules governing the account.\nQ:\nCan I participate if I am unable to attend the special meeting?\nA:\nIf you are unable to attend the special meeting or, in the event that the special meeting is held by means of\nremote communication, virtually, we encourage you to send in your proxy card or to vote by telephone or over\nthe Internet.\nQ:\nWhere can I find the voting results of the special meeting?\nA:\nHillrom intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Hillrom\nfiles with the SEC are publicly available.\nQ:\nWhat happens if the merger is not completed?\nA:\nIf the merger agreement is not approved by the Hillrom shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any\nother reason, Hillrom shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Hillrom common stock in\nconnection\n16\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nwith the merger. Instead, Hillrom will remain an independent public company and shares of Hillrom common\nstock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. The merger agreement provides that, upon termination\nof the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Hillrom may be required to pay to Baxter a termination fee\nof $367 million. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Hillrom\u201d for a\ndiscussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee may be required to be paid. The merger\nagreement also provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain other circumstances,\nBaxter may be required to pay to Hillrom a termination fee of $420 million. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger\nAgreement-Termination Fee Payable by Baxter\u201d for a discussion of the circumstances under which such a\ntermination fee may be required to be paid.\nQ:\nHow can I obtain additional information about Hillrom?\nA:\nHillrom will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2020 Annual\nReport to Shareholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020,\nwithout charge to any shareholder who makes a written request to our Secretary at 130 E.

The information provided on or accessible through our\nwebsite is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other\nreference to our website provided in this proxy statement.\nQ:\nHow many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address\nwith another shareholder?\nA:\nThe SEC\u2019s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for\nproxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single\nproxy statement to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as \u201chouseholding,\u201d\npotentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. Hillrom and some\nbrokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple\nshareholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from\nthe affected shareholders. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to\nreceive a separate proxy statement, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and\nyou wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker if your shares are\nheld in a brokerage account or Hillrom if you are a shareholder of record by sending a written request to our\nSecretary at 130 E. Randolph Street, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60601 or calling (312) 819-7200. In addition,\nHillrom will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate\ncopy of the proxy statement.\nQ:\nWho should I contact if I have any questions?\nA:\nIf you have questions about the merger or the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or desire\nadditional copies of this proxy statement or additional proxy cards or otherwise need assistance voting, you\nshould contact:\nINNISFREE M&A INCORPORATED\n\u202f\n501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor\nNew York, New York 10022\nShareholders May Call TOLL-FREE: (877) 687-1871\nBanks and Brokers May Call Collect: (212) 750-5833\n17\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",

        "Section Text": "Effects on Hillrom if the Merger Is Not Completed\nIf the merger agreement is not approved by the Hillrom shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other\nreason, Hillrom shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead,\nHillrom will remain an independent public company. In addition, if the merger is not completed, Hillrom expects that\nmanagement will operate Hillrom\u2019s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that\nHillrom shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently\nsubject, including, without limitation, risks related to the competitive industry in which Hillrom operates and adverse\neconomic conditions.\nFurthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the merger\nnot to be completed, it is possible that the price of Hillrom common stock will decline significantly. If that were to\noccur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of Hillrom common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of\nthe date of this proxy statement.\nAccordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and\nopportunities on the future value of your shares of Hillrom common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Hillrom\nBoard will continue to evaluate and review Hillrom\u2019s business operations, properties, dividend policy and\ncapitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to identify\nstrategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. If the merger agreement is not approved by the Hillrom\nshareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other\ntransaction acceptable to Hillrom will be offered or that Hillrom\u2019s business, prospects or results of operation will not\nbe adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, Hillrom may be required to pay\nBaxter a termination fee in an amount equal to $367 million. The merger agreement also provides that Baxter may be\nrequired to pay Hillrom a termination fee equal to $420 million upon termination under certain specified circumstances.\nSee \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee Payable by Hillrom\u201d and \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Termination Fee\nPayable by Baxter.\u201d",

        "Section Text": "Background of the Merger\nOver the years, in the ordinary course of business, as part of our ongoing consideration and evaluation of our long-\nterm strategic goals and plans, the Hillrom Board and Hillrom\u2019s senior management have periodically reviewed,\nconsidered and assessed our priorities, operations and financial performance, as well as overall industry conditions,\nas they may affect those strategic goals and plans. These reviews have included, among other items, the\nconsideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic\nalternatives, as compared to the benefits and risks of continued operation as a standalone company, and have\nsometimes included outside financial and legal advisors.\n25TABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn July 16, 2021, Jos\u00e9 (Joe) E. Almeida, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Baxter, placed a phone call\nto John P. Groetelaars, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hillrom. In that phone conversation, Mr. Almeida\nindicated that Baxter would be interested in acquiring Hillrom in an all-cash transaction for $144 per share and that\nfollowing that telephone call, Mr. Almeida would be sending a letter to Mr. Groetelaars outlining the Baxter proposal.\nMr. Groetelaars informed Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the proposal with the Hillrom Board.\nFollowing the telephone call, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing a non-binding indication of\ninterest (the \u201cJuly 16 Letter\u201d) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock at a value of\n$144 per share in cash. The July 16 Letter noted, among other things, that Baxter\u2019s proposal was subject to the\nsatisfactory completion of due diligence as well as the negotiation and execution of a merger agreement and other\nrelated documentation. The July 16 Letter also stated that the transaction would not be subject to a financing\ncondition.\nFollowing receipt of the July 16 Letter, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference on July 18, 2021 during\nwhich members of Hillrom\u2019s senior management, representatives of Hillrom\u2019s financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, and\nrepresentatives of Hillrom\u2019s legal counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u201cWachtell Lipton\u201d), were present. At the\nmeeting, Mr. Groetelaars described the July 16 Letter, which was provided to the Hillrom Board in advance of the\nmeeting, as well as the July 16, 2021 telephone call that he had received from Mr. Almeida in connection with the July\n16 Letter. The Hillrom Board discussed the proposal contained in the July 16, 2021 Letter, including in the context of\nHillrom\u2019s standalone plan and the current economic environment. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided an\noverview of the Hillrom Board\u2019s fiduciary duties in the context of the Hillrom Board\u2019s consideration of a proposal to\nacquire Hillrom. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of the current market landscape and\nHillrom\u2019s performance, and described the actions that Goldman Sachs could take, with the assistance of Hillrom\u2019s\nmanagement, to assist the Hillrom Board in assessing the proposal. The Hillrom Board discussed potential next steps\nand directed management to work with Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton to evaluate the proposal from financial\nand legal perspectives.\nOn July 19, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars emailed a letter to Mr. Almeida stating that the Hillrom Board would carefully review\nand consider the July 16 Letter, including with the assistance of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, and stating that\nthe Hillrom Board would respond to the July 16 Letter once it was prepared to do so.\nOn July 23, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of Hillrom\u2019s\nsenior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. At the meeting, members of Hillrom\nsenior management reviewed and discussed Hillrom\u2019s long-range outlook and financial plan, including preliminary\nproposed projections prepared by management for discussion and review with the Hillrom Board. Following this\nreview, the Hillrom Board further discussed the July 16 Letter and potential responses, as well as Baxter\u2019s corporate\nculture and the potential contribution of the fit of the two companies\u2019 corporate cultures and respective stakeholders\nto successfully completing the possible transaction.\nOn July 25, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of Hillrom\u2019s\nsenior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Members of Hillrom\u2019s senior\nmanagement reviewed with the Hillrom Board management\u2019s final projections of Hillrom\u2019s long-range financial plan,\nwhich reflected input from members of the Hillrom Board and members of Hillrom\u2019s senior management following the\ndiscussion of such plan at the prior meeting on July 23, 2021. These projections are more fully described in \u201c-Certain\nUnaudited Financial Projections.\u201d Representatives of Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Hillrom Board their\npreliminary financial analysis of the proposal contained in the July 16 Letter, including their analysis of Baxter\u2019s\npotential financing plan and Baxter\u2019s overall ability to pay in an acquisition of Hillrom. Following this discussion,\nmembers of the Hillrom Board further discussed the proposal and potential responses, including in the context of\nHillrom\u2019s standalone plan, as well as potential short- and long-term execution and strategic risks to Hillrom\u2019s long-\nrange financial plan on a standalone basis. Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board determined that the $144\nprice per share was inadequate to warrant further discussion of the proposal set forth in the July 16 Letter. The\nHillrom Board then authorized Mr. Groetelaars to meet with Mr. Almeida to inform him that the $144 price per share\nwas inadequate and that if Baxter wished to have further discussions with Hillrom regarding a potential transaction,\nBaxter would need to materially improve the value of its proposal.\nOn July 27, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars met in person with Mr. Almeida in the Chicago, Illinois area. At this meeting, Mr.\nGroetelaars conveyed the Hillrom Board\u2019s conclusion that, while a combination of Hillrom and Baxter could make\nstrategic sense, the proposal set forth in the July 16 Letter undervalued Hillrom, and that Hillrom was unwilling\n26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nto engage in discussions with Baxter at the $144 per share price that Baxter had proposed. Mr. Groetelaars informed\nMr. Almeida that if Baxter wished to pursue a transaction with Hillrom, it would need to materially improve the value\nof its proposal. Mr. Almeida asked Mr. Groetelaars to provide guidance on Hillrom\u2019s valuation, including to provide\ncertain confidential information to assist with Baxter\u2019s valuation. Mr. Groetelaars reiterated that Hillrom was unwilling\nto share any such information or engage in further discussions based on the proposal contained in the July 16 Letter.\nOn July 28, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting market rumors that Hillrom and Baxter had been engaged\nin discussions regarding a potential transaction and that Hillrom had rejected an offer from Baxter of $144 per share of\nHillrom common stock. Other news agencies published similar news articles on July 28, 2021.\nLater on July 28, 2021, Mr. Almeida called Mr. Groetelaars and stated that Baxter was increasing its proposal to $148\nper share in cash, and that following their telephone call, Mr. Almeida would be sending a letter to Mr. Groetelaars\noutlining the revised proposal. Mr. Groetelaars told Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the updated proposal with the\nHillrom Board.\nFollowing the telephone call, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing the updated non-binding\nindication of interest (the \u201cJuly 28 Letter\u201d) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock\nat a value of $148 per share in cash. The proposal set forth in the July 28 Letter otherwise included substantially the\nsame terms as the proposal set forth in the July 16 Letter. The July 28 Letter also attached a draft confidentiality\nagreement.\nOn July 29, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of Hillrom\u2019s\nsenior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Groetelaars provided an\noverview of recent events, including the Bloomberg article and other reports from the day before, as well as his\nrecent communications with Mr. Almeida, including the revised proposal contained in the July 28 Letter (which letter\nwas provided to the Hillrom Board in advance of the meeting) to acquire Hillrom for $148 per share in cash, and Mr.\nAlmeida\u2019s request to review certain Hillrom confidential information. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell\nLipton summarized the key terms of the revised proposal and potential responses, which the Hillrom Board\ndiscussed. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an updated preliminary financial analysis of the revised\nproposal and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Hillrom Board its legal obligations in connection\nwith its consideration of the July 28 Letter. Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board determined that the $148\nprice per share contained in the July 28 Letter was inadequate to warrant further discussions with Baxter regarding\nthe proposal set forth in the July 28 Letter, and that Mr. Groetelaars should inform Mr. Almeida that, while the Hillrom\nBoard understood the potential strategic value of a combination between Hillrom and Baxter, Baxter would need to\nmaterially improve the value of its proposal to warrant further discussion.\nOn July 30, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars called Mr. Almeida and conveyed the message that the Hillrom Board remained open\nto a transaction that was in the best interests of Hillrom and its shareholders, including one with Baxter, but that it\nwould not engage with Baxter on a transaction that undervalued Hillrom. Mr. Groetelaars informed Mr. Almeida that\nthe Hillrom Board had carefully reviewed the proposal contained in the July 28 Letter with its outside financial and\nlegal advisors, and had concluded that the proposal significantly undervalued Hillrom and did not provide a basis for\nfurther discussions or the sharing of confidential information with Baxter, and that it would only do so if Baxter\nproposed a transaction that fairly valued Hillrom for the Hillrom Board to consider. After the phone call, Mr.\nGroetelaars emailed Mr. Almeida a letter summarizing the position of the Hillrom Board that he had conveyed to Mr.\nAlmeida during the telephone call.\nOn August 1, 2021, Mr. Almeida called Mr. Groetelaars and stated that Baxter was increasing its offer to $154 per\nshare in cash, and that following their telephone call, Mr. Almeida would be sending a letter to Mr. Groetelaars\noutlining the further revised proposal. Mr. Almeida also reiterated his request that Hillrom provide certain confidential\ninformation for Baxter\u2019s review. Mr. Groetelaars informed Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the updated proposal\nwith the Hillrom Board.\nFollowing the telephone call, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing the updated non-binding\nindication of interest (the \u201cAugust 1 Letter\u201d) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common\nstock at a value of $154 per share in cash. The proposal contained in the August 1 Letter otherwise reflected\nsubstantially the same terms as the proposals set forth in the July 16 Letter and the July 28 Letter. The August 1\nsubstantially the same terms as the proposals set forth in the July 16 Letter and the July 28 Letter. The August 1\nLetter also attached a draft confidentiality agreement, identical to the draft confidentiality agreement attached to the\nJuly 28 Letter.\n27\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nOn August 1, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of\nHillrom\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Groetelaars provided\nan overview of his recent communications with Mr. Almeida, including the revised proposal contained in the August\n1 Letter (which letter was provided to the Hillrom Board in advance of the meeting) to acquire Hillrom for $154 per\nshare in cash, and Mr. Almeida\u2019s request to review certain Hillrom confidential information, including potentially in a\nmeeting that would be attended by members of senior management of Hillrom and Baxter. Mr. Groetelaars also\ninformed the Hillrom Board that while he thought it might be possible for Baxter to improve its $154 per share offer, he\nbelieved, based on the position Mr. Almeida had conveyed in their most recent discussion, that Baxter would be\nunlikely to do so without access to confidential information in a management meeting. Representatives of Goldman\nSachs and Wachtell Lipton summarized the key terms of the revised proposal and potential responses, which the\nHillrom Board then discussed. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an updated preliminary financial analysis\nof the revised proposal and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Hillrom Board its legal obligations.\nFollowing these discussions, the Hillrom Board determined to authorize management to provide certain confidential\ninformation to Baxter through a management meeting in order to determine whether Baxter would increase its\nproposed purchase price.\nFollowing the meeting of the Hillrom Board, Mr. Groetelaars contacted Mr. Almeida to state that the Hillrom Board\nhad authorized a meeting between senior management of both Hillrom and Baxter, where Hillrom would provide\ncertain limited non-public information regarding Hillrom via a management presentation, with the understanding that\nBaxter would be expected to improve the value of its proposed $154 price per share contained in the August 1 Letter,\nand that the Hillrom Board was not prepared to support a transaction at a price per share of $154. Mr. Groetelaars and\nMr. Almeida agreed to schedule the meeting for August 4, 2021 in the Chicago, Illinois area.\nBetween August 1, 2021 and August 3, 2021, Hillrom and Baxter negotiated the terms of a confidentiality agreement,\nwith representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Baxter\u2019s legal counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (\u201cSullivan & Cromwell\u201d),\nparticipating in such negotiations. On August 3, 2021, Hillrom and Baxter entered into the confidentiality agreement,\nwhich included a customary standstill provision.\nOn August 4, 2021, members of Hillrom\u2019s senior management met in person with members of Baxter\u2019s senior\nmanagement. At the meeting, senior management of Hillrom provided senior management of Baxter with additional\ninformation regarding Hillrom\u2019s business, potential areas of value and the development of its Connected Care\nportfolio, and Baxter described its vision for the proposed combined business.\nOn August 6, 2021, Mr. Almeida called Mr. Groetelaars and informed him that Baxter was willing to increase its offer to\nacquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock for $156 per share in cash. Mr. Almeida informed Mr.\nGroetelaars that the $156 per share price represented Baxter\u2019s \u201cbest and final\u201d offer, and that if it was insufficient to\nwarrant further discussions, then Baxter would no longer pursue the potential transaction with Hillrom. Mr.\nGroetelaars told Mr. Almeida that he would discuss the updated proposal with the Hillrom Board.\nOn August 9, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of\nHillrom\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities (who the Hillrom Board\ndetermined to retain to act as an additional financial advisor) and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Groetelaars provided an\noverview of recent events, including the August 4, 2021 management meeting with members of Baxter\u2019s senior\nmanagement and his recent communications with Mr. Almeida, including the revised proposal to acquire Hillrom for\n$156 per share in cash, and the fact that Mr. Almeida had conveyed that the $156 per share price represented Baxter\u2019s\nbest and final offer. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton summarized the key terms of the revised\nproposal and potential responses, which the Hillrom Board then discussed. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and\nBofA Securities provided preliminary financial analyses of the revised proposal, including their respective analyses\nof Baxter\u2019s overall ability to pay in an acquisition of Hillrom, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with\nthe Hillrom Board its legal obligations. The Hillrom Board discussed the revised proposal, including in comparison to\nHillrom\u2019s standalone prospects and the current market environment, as well as whether other potential bidders would\nbe capable of offering, and willing to offer, a greater value than Baxter\u2019s $156 per share all-cash proposal. Members of\nthe Hillrom Board also discussed that Hillrom had not received any proposals to acquire Hillrom or engage in an\nextraordinary transaction from any parties (other than Baxter) following the July 28, 2021 Bloomberg story regarding\nrumors of the transaction discussions between Hillrom and Baxter.\nAfter discussion, including consultation with representatives of Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities regarding the\nlikelihood of potential competing bidders and after considering the risk of additional leaks and delays, including\n28\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe potential impact on Baxter\u2019s proposal, the Hillrom Board determined not to contact third parties to solicit\nalternative proposals at that time. Following these discussions, the Hillrom Board authorized members of Hillrom\nsenior management to negotiate a transaction with Baxter based on the $156 per share all-cash purchase price, but\ndetermined that approval of any such transaction would be subject to acceptable terms regarding (1) transaction\ncertainty, (2) sufficient flexibility to operate Hillrom\u2019s business between the signing of definitive documentation and\nclosing of the transaction, (3) the ability of Hillrom to consider alternative proposals prior to shareholder approval of\nthe transaction, and under certain circumstances, terminate any definitive agreement with Baxter to enter into a\nsuperior proposal, and (4) Hillrom being provided with the flexibility necessary to retain its employees during the\nperiod between signing and closing.\nFollowing the meeting of the Hillrom Board, Mr. Groetelaars contacted Mr. Almeida to state that the Hillrom Board\nhad authorized him to provide additional confidential information of Hillrom to Baxter and to negotiate a transaction\nwith Baxter at the $156 per share all-cash purchase price previously conveyed orally by Mr. Almeida on August 6,\n2021, subject to alignment on the four matters described above. Mr. Almeida stated that he was confident that the\ntwo parties and their advisors would be able to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement, including on those four\nkey points. Mr. Groetelaars and Mr. Almeida agreed to target the completion of documentation and the\nannouncement of a transaction in late August or early September. Mr. Almeida also informed Mr. Groetelaars that\nSullivan & Cromwell had prepared a draft merger agreement and would share the draft with Wachtell Lipton.\nLater on August 9, 2021, Mr. Almeida emailed a letter to Mr. Groetelaars containing the proposal (the \u201cAugust 9\nBaxter Letter\u201d) for Baxter to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock at a value of $156 per share\nin cash. The August 9 Baxter Letter reiterated that the $156 offer was Baxter\u2019s best and final offer.\nAdditionally, following receipt of the August 9 Baxter Letter, Mr. Groetelaars emailed a letter to Mr. Almeida\nsummarizing their telephone call from earlier that day and stating that the Hillrom Board\u2019s decision to pursue a\ntransaction with Baxter at the $156 per share price was subject to acceptable resolution of the four key issues that Mr.\nGroetelaars had identified to Mr. Almeida during their telephone call.\nOn August 9, 2021, Sullivan & Cromwell provided an initial draft of the proposed merger agreement to Wachtell\nLipton. Between August 9, 2021 and September 1, 2021, Mr. Groetelaars and Mr. Almeida, as well as Hillrom and\nBaxter\u2019s respective management teams and legal and financial advisors, engaged in extensive negotiations regarding\nthe terms of the proposed merger agreement, including the parties\u2019 required efforts to obtain regulatory approvals,\nHillrom\u2019s ability to terminate the merger agreement and accept a superior proposal, the inclusion, terms and the size of\nthe fees payable upon termination of the merger agreement, Hillrom\u2019s obligations with respect to the conduct of its\nbusiness between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger, and matters related to the\ncompensation and retention of Hillrom employees. During the course of these negotiations, significant areas of\ndiscussion and negotiation between the parties included, among other things, the \u201cdeal protection\u201d provisions of the\nagreement (including the termination fee payable by Hillrom), Hillrom\u2019s obligations with respect to the operation of its\nbusiness during the period between the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger, the\nscope of the restrictions applicable to actions taken by Hillrom during the period between the signing of the merger\nagreement and the consummation of the merger with respect to employee compensation and benefits and employee\nretention matters, and Baxter\u2019s obligations to obtain regulatory approvals and the termination fee payable by Baxter\nin the event of failure to obtain regulatory approval.\nIn addition, beginning on August 12, 2021, Hillrom made available to Baxter and its representatives certain due\ndiligence information in a confidential data room, including the Hillrom Projections (as defined below). Thereafter,\nfrom August 12, 2021 through September 1, 2021, Baxter, with the assistance of its advisors, conducted due diligence\non Hillrom, including through the materials made available in the confidential data room and telephone and\nvideoconference calls with members of Hillrom management. In order for Hillrom to provide Baxter and its\nrepresentatives access to certain sensitive information, on August 30, 2021, Hillrom and Baxter entered into an\nadditional confidentiality agreement pursuant to which certain sensitive information would be provided to certain\nmembers of Baxter senior management and Baxter\u2019s representatives only in a separate limited data room.\nOn August 29, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of\nHillrom\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton.\n29\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nMr. Groetelaars provided an overview of recent developments, including updates regarding the ongoing discussions\nwith respect to a potential transaction with Baxter, including regarding the status of negotiations with respect to the\nproposed terms of the merger agreement, the due diligence review and the timing for a potential transaction\nannouncement.\nLater on August 29, 2021, The Wall Street Journal published an article reporting market rumors that Hillrom and\nBaxter were engaged in advanced discussions regarding a potential transaction whereby Baxter would acquire\nHillrom for a price of approximately $150 per share of Hillrom common stock. Other news agencies published similar\nnews articles on August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2021. Additionally, on August 30, 2021, CNBC reported on market\nrumors that Hillrom and Baxter were engaged in advanced discussions regarding a potential transaction whereby\nBaxter would acquire Hillrom for a price of approximately $156 per share of Hillrom common stock.\nOn August 31, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of\nHillrom\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton. Mr.\nGroetelaars provided an overview of recent events, including an update regarding the status of discussions and\nnegotiations of a potential transaction with Baxter since the Hillrom Board meeting held on August 29, 2021.\nRepresentatives of Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities reviewed and discussed with the Hillrom Board, among other\nmatters, their financial analyses of the proposed transaction and the proposed $156 per share all-cash price to be paid\nto holders of Hillrom common stock (other than excluded shares) in the proposed merger. Additionally, prior to the\nmeeting, Goldman Sachs had provided a relationship disclosure letter (a previous draft of which had been reviewed\nby members of Hillrom senior management) to the Hillrom Board providing certain information regarding its\nrelationships with Hillrom and Baxter, and prior to the meeting BofA Securities had provided a relationship disclosure\nletter (a previous version of which had been reviewed by members of Hillrom senior management) to the Hillrom\nBoard providing certain information regarding its material relationships with each of Hillrom and Baxter, each of which\nletters were discussed with the Hillrom Board at the meeting. Members of Hillrom management reviewed with the\nHillrom Board the status and process of the due diligence review of Hillrom by Baxter and of the planned\ncommunications rollout by both Hillrom and Baxter. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the Hillrom\nBoard certain legal considerations, including the directors\u2019 duties in connection with their consideration of the\npotential transaction, and the principal terms of the draft merger agreement. Members of the Hillrom Board also\ndiscussed that Hillrom had still not received any proposals to acquire Hillrom or engage in an extraordinary\ntransaction from any parties (other than Baxter) following the July 28, 2021 Bloomberg story regarding rumors of the\ntransaction discussions between Hillrom and Baxter or following the August 29, 2021 Wall Street Journal story\nregarding rumors of the transaction discussions between Hillrom and Baxter. Following these discussions, the Hillrom\nBoard instructed Hillrom\u2019s management and its advisors to continue to negotiate the terms of the potential\ntransaction, with a further update to be provided to the Hillrom Board at its next meeting.\nBetween August 31, 2021 and September 1, 2021, Hillrom\u2019s and Baxter\u2019s respective management teams, with the\nassistance of their respective legal advisors, finalized the remaining open issues related to the merger agreement and\nrelated transaction documents.\nOn September 1, 2021, the Hillrom Board held a meeting by videoconference, which was attended by members of\nHillrom\u2019s senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Wachtell Lipton. At this\ntime, Mr. Groetelaars informed the Hillrom Board that the remaining matters in the merger agreement had been\nresolved in a manner consistent with the discussions with the Hillrom Board on the prior day. A representative of\nGoldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 1, 2021, to the\nHillrom Board to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth\ntherein, the per share merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than\nBaxter and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of\nHillrom common stock. In addition, a representative of BofA Securities rendered to the Hillrom Board BofA Securities\u2019\noral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 1, 2021, to the effect that, as of\nthat date and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its written opinion, the per\nshare merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than\nholders of excluded shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.\nFollowing further discussion, during which the directors considered the matters reviewed and discussed at that\nmeeting and prior meetings, including factors described under the section of this proxy statement entitled \u201c-Reasons\nfor the Merger,\u201d the Hillrom Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions\n30\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ncontemplated by the merger agreement were fair to and in the best interests of Hillrom and its shareholders, and\nunanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement in all respects, and recommended that Hillrom\u2019s shareholders approve the merger agreement.\nDuring the evening of September 1, 2021, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement. Thereafter, the\ntransaction was announced before the opening of the financial markets in New York on September 2, 2021, in a press\nrelease jointly issued by Hillrom and Baxter.",

described in such opinion, the per share\nmerger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than\nholders of excluded shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, and the financial\nanalysis related thereto prepared by BofA Securities, as more fully described below under the section\nentitled \u201cOpinion of BofA Securities, Inc.\u201d\u037e\n31TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe course and history of the negotiations between Hillrom and Baxter, as described under \u201c- Background\nof the Merger,\u201d Baxter\u2019s initial offer of $144.00 per share, which was subsequently increased to $148.00 per\nshare and to $154.00 per share, as well as Baxter\u2019s offer of $156.00 per share, which the Hillrom Board and\nmanagement believed was Baxter\u2019s best and final offer\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Baxter agreed to (and agreed to cause Baxter\u2019s subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts\nto obtain all necessary governmental approvals with respect to the merger, including (i) agreeing to\ndivestitures, (ii) modifying contractual or commercial relationships and (iii) taking other actions that may\nchange the conduct of Baxter\u2019s business, in each case as necessary to obtain any such approval, subject in\neach case to certain limitations described under \u201cThe Merger Agreement-Required Efforts to Consummate\nthe Merger,\u201d together with the fact that Baxter agreed to pay to Hillrom a $420 million termination fee under\nthe circumstances described under \u201c-Termination Fee Payable by Baxter\u201d\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Hillrom Board\u2019s belief, based on the advice of Hillrom\u2019s financial advisors and its knowledge of the\nindustry and the operations of Hillrom, that it was unlikely that any other potential acquirors, including\nfinancial sponsors and strategic buyers, would be willing and able to acquire Hillrom at a price in excess of\n$156.00 per share in cash, even if Hillrom were to conduct an auction process or other solicitation of\nalternative acquisition proposals\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that there were media reports that Baxter had proposed to acquire Hillrom, which provided any third\nparty wishing to engage in discussions with Hillrom with an opportunity to make its interest known, and\nthe fact that, although the Hillrom Board had not granted Baxter exclusivity and was free to consider\nindications of interest from any other party, no potential acquiror other than Baxter made a proposal to\nacquire Hillrom during the six-week period between the initial media reports and the public announcement\nof the merger agreement on September 2, 2021, and the Hillrom Board\u2019s view that, if potential acquirors were\ninterested in exploring a transaction with Hillrom, such potential acquirors could have engaged with the\nHillrom Board or its representatives before such public announcement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Hillrom Board\u2019s belief that the termination fee and other limitations applicable to, among other things, a\nchange of recommendation and alternative acquisition proposals agreed to in the merger agreement were\nreasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquirer from\nsubmitting a proposal to acquire Hillrom following the announcement of the merger or prohibit the Hillrom\nBoard or its representatives from engaging with any such potential acquiror, subject to the applicable\nprovisions of the merger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Hillrom Board\u2019s review of the structure of the merger and the financial and other terms of the merger\nagreement, including, among others, the following terms of the merger agreement:\n\u2022\nthe conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Hillrom Board believed are\nreasonable and customary in number and scope\u037e\n\u2022\nrepresentations from Baxter and Merger Sub that they will have available all funds necessary for the\npayment of the aggregate merger consideration, and the absence of a financing condition in the\nmerger agreement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Hillrom Board, subject to certain conditions, to provide information to and engage in\ndiscussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal if the\nHillrom Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and\noutside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to\nlead to a superior proposal\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Hillrom Board, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation that\nHillrom shareholders approve the merger agreement and, in addition, to cause Hillrom to terminate the\nmerger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement that constitutes a superior\nproposal, if the Hillrom Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors\nand outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary\nduties of the members of the Hillrom Board\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of Hillrom in the merger\nagreement\u037e\n32\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that Hillrom\u2019s outside financial and legal advisors were involved in the negotiations and updated\nthe Hillrom Board directly throughout the process, which provided oversight and additional perspectives\non the negotiations in addition to those of Hillrom\u2019s management\u037e\n\u2022\nthe Hillrom Board\u2019s belief that the complementary product offerings of Hillrom and Baxter will support\npatients in the hospital, at home, and in alternate sites of care, allowing better integration and coordination\nof healthcare delivery\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe Hillrom Board\u2019s belief that the combination of Hillrom and Baxter will unite two organizations that have\neach been recognized for achievements in workplace diversity and corporate responsibility, and for\nfostering an environment that supports and encourages high performance, respect for individuals, and\nprofessional growth.\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Hillrom Board, in consultation with Hillrom\u2019s management and Hillrom\u2019s outside\nfinancial and legal advisors, also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the\nmerger agreement and the merger, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe fact that, subsequent to completion of the merger, Hillrom will no longer exist as an independent public\ncompany and that as a cash acquisition, the transaction would prevent Hillrom shareholders from being\nable to participate in any value creation that Hillrom could generate going forward, as well as any future\nappreciation in the value of Hillrom\u037e\n\u2022\nthe covenants in the merger agreement prohibiting Hillrom from soliciting other potential acquisition\nproposals, and restricting its ability to entertain other potential acquisition proposals, unless certain\nconditions are satisfied, and the covenants in the merger agreement requiring Hillrom to provide Baxter with\nan opportunity within four (4) business days to match any competing acquisition proposal that constitutes\na superior proposal, which could discourage potential acquirors from making a competing acquisition\nproposal, although the Hillrom Board believed these covenants would not preclude an interested and able\npotential acquiror from seeking to acquire Hillrom\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Hillrom would be obligated to pay a termination fee of $367 million under certain\ncircumstances, including the potential impact of such termination fee on the willingness of other potential\nacquirors to propose alternative transactions, although the Hillrom Board believed that the termination fee\nwas reasonable and customary and would not preclude a serious and financially capable potential acquiror\nfrom submitting a proposal to acquire Hillrom following the announcement of the merger\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that Baxter\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger are subject to regulatory\napprovals and other conditions, and the possibility that such conditions may not be satisfied, including as\na result of events outside of Hillrom\u2019s control, and the fact that, if the merger is not consummated:\n\u2022\nHillrom\u2019s directors, officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will\nhave experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction, and\nHillrom will have incurred significant transaction costs attempting to consummate the transaction\u037e\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perception of Hillrom\u2019s continuing business could potentially result in a loss of\ncustomers, suppliers, distributors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe trading price of Hillrom common stock could be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on Hillrom\u2019s business and relationships with\ncustomers, suppliers, distributors, business partners, collaboration partners and employees, including the\nrisk that certain key members of Hillrom management might choose not to remain employed with Hillrom\nprior to the completion of the merger, regardless of whether or not the merger is completed\u037e\n\u2022\nthe fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Hillrom has agreed that it will use reasonable best\nefforts to carry on its business in all material respects in the ordinary course, and, subject to specified\nexceptions, that Hillrom will not take a number of actions related to the conduct of its business without\nBaxter\u2019s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the\npossibility these terms may limit the ability of Hillrom to pursue business opportunities that it would\notherwise pursue, including potential acquisitions, investments and other strategic opportunities\u037e\n33\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\u2022\nthe fact that certain of Hillrom\u2019s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are\ndifferent from, and in addition to, those of Hillrom\u2019s other shareholders.

In view of\nthe complexity and the large number of the factors considered, the Hillrom Board, both individually and collectively,\ndid not quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various factors. Rather, the Hillrom Board based its\nrecommendation on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members\nof the Hillrom Board may have given different weights to different factors. The above factors are not presented in any\norder of priority. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Hillrom Board is forward-\nlooking in nature.

In that\nregard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Hillrom\u2019s consent that the Hillrom Projections were reasonably prepared on a\nbasis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Hillrom. Goldman Sachs\ndid not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative\nor other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Hillrom or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any\nsuch evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and\napprovals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected\nbenefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not\nsolicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, Hillrom or any\nother alternative transaction.

Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the implied premia and implied\nmultiples described below based on the $156.00 in cash per share of Hillrom common stock to be paid to holders\n(other than Baxter and its affiliates) of shares of Hillrom common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.\n35\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGoldman Sachs calculated the implied premia represented by the $156.00 in cash per share of Hillrom common stock\nrelative to:\n\u2022\n$123.78, the closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock on July 27, 2021 (the \u201cUndisturbed\nShare Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$145.78, the closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock on August 30, 2021 (the \u201cAugust 30,\n2021 Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$144.00, the closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock on July 15, 2021, the day Baxter\ninitially approached Hillrom (the \u201cInitial Approach Share Price\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$123.78, the highest closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock over the fifty-two (52)-week\nperiod ended July 27, 2021 (\u201c52-Week High\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$115.99, the volume weighted average price per share (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of Hillrom common stock over the thirty\n(30)-trading-day period ended July 27, 2021 (\u201c30-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e\n\u2022\n$113.44, the VWAP of Hillrom common stock over the sixty (60)-trading-day period ended August, 2021\n(\u201c60-Day VWAP\u201d)\u037e and\n\u2022\n$81.17, the lowest closing trading price per share of Hillrom common stock over the fifty-two (52)-week\nperiod ended July 27, 2021 (\u201c52-Week Low\u201d).\nThe results of these calculations and comparisons are as follows:\nReference Price per Share:\nImplied Premium \nRepresented by\n$156.00 \nin Cash per Share of\nHillrom Common\nStock\nUndisturbed Share Price of $123.78\n26.0%\nAugust 30, 2021 Share Price of $145.78\n7.0%\nInitial Approach Share Price of $144.00\n8.3%\n52-Week High of $123.78\n26.0%\n30-Day VWAP of $115.99\n34.5%\n60-Day VWAP of $113.44\n37.5%\n52-Week Low of $81.17\n92.2%\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs calculated an implied equity value of Hillrom for purposes of calculating the following\nmultiples by multiplying the $156.00 in cash per share of Hillrom common stock by the total number of fully diluted\noutstanding shares of Hillrom common stock as of August 26, 2021, as provided by the management of Hillrom.\nGoldman Sachs then calculated an implied enterprise value of Hillrom by adding to the implied equity value it\ncalculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021, pro forma for the incurrence of $375.0 million of incremental\ndebt and use of $36.4 million of cash from Hillrom\u2019s balance sheet in connection with the acquisition of Bardy\nDiagnostics, Inc. (\u201cBardyDx\u201d), in each case as provided by the management of Hillrom.\nUsing the foregoing, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied enterprise value for Hillrom as a multiple of Hillrom\u2019s\nprojected Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal years 2021 to 2022 as set forth in the Hillrom Projections and the last twelve\n(12) months (\u201cLTM\u201d) ended June 30, 2021 as provided by the management of Hillrom. For purposes of this section,\n\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude\nacquisition and integration costs and related fair value adjustments, field corrective actions, regulatory compliance\ncosts and special charges.\nThe results of these calculations are as follows:\nImplied Enterprise Value as a Multiple of:\nMultiples\nLTM ending June 30, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA\n19.5x\nFiscal Year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA (estimated)\n18.8x\nFiscal Year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA (estimated)\n17.5x\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis. Using the Hillrom Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted\ncash flow analysis on Hillrom. Using discount rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting estimates of\n36\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nHillrom\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021 (i)\nestimates of unlevered free cash flow for Hillrom for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 through the fourth quarter\nof the fiscal year 2031 as reflected in the Hillrom Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Hillrom,\nwhich were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to 2.0%, to a terminal year estimate of\nthe free cash flow to be generated by Hillrom, as reflected in the Hillrom Projections (which analysis implied exit\nterminal year next-twelve (12)-month (\u201cNTM\u201d) EBITDA multiples ranging from 9.6x to 13.1x). Goldman Sachs derived\nsuch discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific\ninputs, including the company\u2019s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on\npermanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain\nfinancial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated\nby Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Hillrom Projections and\nmarket expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs\ncalculated such NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples using NTM Adjusted EBITDA as of September 30, 2031, as\nprovided by the management of Hillrom.\nGoldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Hillrom by adding the ranges of present values it\nderived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Hillrom\nthe net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021, pro forma for the acquisition of BardyDx, as provided by the management\nof Hillrom, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Hillrom. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of\nillustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock, as\nprovided by the management of Hillrom, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Hillrom common\nstock ranging from $137 to $187, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nIllustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the\nimplied present value of an illustrative future value per share of Hillrom common stock. For this analysis, Goldman\nSachs used the Hillrom Projections for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and each of the fiscal years 2022 to 2024.\nGoldman Sachs first calculated the implied values per share of Hillrom common stock as of September 30 for each of\nthe fiscal years 2021 to 2023, by applying enterprise value to NTM Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 13.0x to 15.0x\nAdjusted EBITDA per share of Hillrom common stock as of the end of each fiscal year from 2021 to 2023. These\nillustrative multiple estimates were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience,\ntaking into account Hillrom\u2019s historical NTM trading multiples over time. Goldman Sachs then discounted the derived\nvalues back to Hillrom\u2019s June 30, 2021 using an illustrative discount rate of 7.9%, reflecting an estimate of Hillrom\u2019s\ncost of equity, including the present value of projected dividends paid, as provided by the management of Hillrom.\nGoldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain\ncompany-specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States\nfinancial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Hillrom common\nstock of $109 to $155, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nPremia Analysis. Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia\nfor all transactions announced during the time period from August 30, 2016 through August 30, 2021 involving a\npublic company target based in the United States in any industry (excluding biotech) where the disclosed enterprise\nvalues for the transactions were greater than $10 billion.\nFor the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and\n75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target\u2019s last undisturbed closing stock\nprice prior to announcement of the merger. This analysis indicated a median premium of 29% across the period. This\nanalysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 17% and 75th percentile premium of 39% across the period. Using\nthis analysis, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 17% to 39% to the undisturbed\nclosing price per share of Hillrom common stock of $123.78 as of July 27, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity\nvalues per share of Hillrom common stock of $145 to $172, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nFor the entire period, using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs also calculated the median, 25th percentile\nand 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the transactions relative to the target\u2019s 52-Week High prior to the\nannouncement of the merger. This analysis indicated a median premium of 9% across the period. This analysis also\nindicated a 25th percentile premium of 2% and 75th percentile premium of 22% across the period. Using this analysis,\nGoldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premiums of 2% to 22% to the undisturbed closing price per\nshare of Hillrom common stock of $123.78 as of July 27, 2021 and calculated a range of implied equity values per share\nof Hillrom common stock of $126 to $151, rounded to the nearest dollar.\n37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSelected Transactions Analysis. Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected\ntransactions in the medical technology industry since 2014. For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs\ncalculated and compared the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on the consideration\npaid in the transaction as a multiple of the target company\u2019s LTM Adjusted EBITDA based on information in public\nfilings, press releases and investor relations documents. While none of the companies that participated in the\nselected transactions are directly comparable to Hillrom, the companies that participated in the selected transactions\nare companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of Hillrom\u2019s\nresults, market size and product profile.\nThe following table presents the results of this analysis:\nAnnouncement \nDate\nAcquirer\nTarget\nEnterprise\nValue / \nLTM Adj. \nEBITDA\nApril 2017\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nC.R.

Goldman Sachs then subtracted the net debt of\nHillrom as of June 30, 2021, pro forma for the acquisition of BardyDx, as provided by the management of Hillrom, and\ndivided the result by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Hillrom common stock as of August 26, 2021,\nas provided by the management of Hillrom, to derive a reference range of implied values per share of Hillrom common\nstock of $105 to $172, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nThe preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or\nsummary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the\nanalyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute\nany particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to\nfairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.\nNo company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Hillrom or Baxter or\nthe contemplated merger.\nGoldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs\u2019 providing its opinion to the Hillrom Board\nas to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than Baxter\nand its affiliates), as of the date of the opinion, of the per share merger consideration to be paid to such holders\npursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the\nprices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are\nnot necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested\nby these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors\nor events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Hillrom, Baxter, Goldman Sachs or\nany other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.\nThe per share merger consideration was determined through arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Hillrom and Baxter\nand was approved by the Hillrom Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Hillrom during these negotiations.\nGoldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to Hillrom or the Hillrom Board or\nthat any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.\n38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAs described above, Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion to the Hillrom Board was one of many factors taken into consideration\nby the Hillrom Board in making its determination to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The foregoing summary\ndoes not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the\nfairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as\nAnnex B.\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and\ntrading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various\npersons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in\nwhich they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold\nor vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit\ndefault swaps and other financial instruments of Hillrom, Baxter, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or\nany currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman\nSachs acted as financial advisor to Hillrom in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading\nto, the merger. Goldman Sachs has acted as financial advisor to Hillrom in connection with, and has participated in\ncertain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs expects to receive fees for its services in\nconnection with the merger, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the merger, and Hillrom has agreed to\nreimburse certain of Goldman Sachs\u2019 expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that\nmay arise, out of its engagement, as described below. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain financial advisory\nand/or underwriting services to Hillrom and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking\nDivision of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as book runner with\nrespect to Hillrom\u2019s 4.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount $425,000,000) in September 2019.\nDuring the two (2) year period ended September 1, 2021, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial\nadvisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to Hillrom and/or its affiliates of\napproximately $3.2 million. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services\nto Baxter and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has\nreceived, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as a co-manager with respect to Baxter\u2019s 1.73%\nSenior Notes due 2031 (aggregate principal amount $650,000,000) in October 2020\u037e and a book runner with respect to\neach of Baxter\u2019s 3.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (aggregate principal amount $750,000,000) and 3.95% Senior Notes due\n2030 (aggregate principal amount $500,000,000) in March 2020. During the two (2) year period ended September 1,\n2021, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by\nits Investment Banking Division to Baxter and/or its affiliates of approximately $2.1 million. Goldman Sachs may also\nin the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Hillrom, Baxter and their respective affiliates\nfor which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.\nThe Hillrom Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter\nagreement dated August 25, 2021, Hillrom engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with\nthe possible sale of all or a portion of Hillrom. The engagement letter between Hillrom and Goldman Sachs provides\nfor a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of the merger agreement, at\napproximately $86 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Hillrom has\nagreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, and to\nindemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal\nsecurities laws.",

The overall low to high 2021E EV / EBITDA multiples observed for the selected companies\nwere 9.8x to 26.3x (with a mean of 18.5x and median of 17.1x). The overall low to high 2022E EV / EBITDA multiples\nobserved for the selected companies were 13.3x to 22.3x (with a mean of 17.2x and median of 17.0x). BofA Securities\nnoted that the 2021E EV / EBITDA multiple and the 2022E EV / EBITDA multiple observed for Hillrom was 18.8x and\n17.7x, respectively, based on the per share merger consideration, and 15.4x and 14.5x, respectively, based on the\nUnaffected Price.\nBased on BofA Securities\u2019 review of the enterprise values to EBITDA multiples for the selected companies and\nHillrom and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied a 2021E EV / EBITDA multiple\nreference range of 14.5x to 18.5x to Hillrom management\u2019s estimates of calendar year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as\nreflected in the Hillrom Projections, and a 2022E EV / EBITDA multiple reference range of 13.0x to 17.0x to Hillrom\nmanagement\u2019s estimates of calendar year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA as reflected in the Hillrom Projections to calculate\nranges of implied enterprise values for Hillrom. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value reference ranges\nper share of Hillrom common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom by subtracting from the resulting ranges\nof implied enterprise values it calculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021 (calculated as debt less cash, and\npro forma for Hillrom\u2019s acquisition of Bardy Diagnostics, Inc.), as reflected in Hillrom\u2019s public filings, and dividing the\nresult by a number of fully-diluted shares of Hillrom common stock outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock\nmethod basis, based on information provided by the management of Hillrom). This analysis indicated the following\napproximate implied equity value reference ranges per share of Hillrom common stock, as compared to the per share\nmerger consideration:\nImplied Equity Value \nReference Range per Share \nof Hillrom Common Stock\n2021E Adjusted \nEBITDA\n2022E Adjusted \nEBITDA\nPer Share Merger \nConsideration\n$117.00 - $156.75\n$114.50 - $157.75\n$156.00\nNo selected publicly traded company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Hillrom. Accordingly,\nan evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex\nconsiderations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that\ncould affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which Hillrom was compared.\nSelected Precedent Transactions Analysis.\nBofA Securities reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to the following thirteen\nselected transactions involving acquisitions of publicly traded medical technology companies since 2014.\nDate\nAcquiror\nTarget\n01/12/21\nSTERIS plc\nCantel Medical Corp.\n12/18/20\nKoninklijke Philips N.V.\nBioTelemetry, Inc.\n05/02/19\n3M Co\nAcelity L.P.

The overall low to high enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiples of the\ntarget companies in the selected transactions were 13.7x to 28.7x (with a mean of 18.4x and median of 16.6x). The\noverall low to high enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiples of the target companies in the selected transactions\nwere 11.0x to 27.3x (with a mean of 17.1x and median of 16.3x).\nBased on BofA Securities\u2019 review of the enterprise values to LTM EBITDA multiples and NTM EBITDA multiples for\nthe selected transactions and on its professional judgment and experience, BofA Securities applied an enterprise\nvalue to LTM EBITDA multiple reference range of 14.0x to 18.0x to Hillrom\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month\nperiod ended June 30, 2021, as reflected in Hillrom\u2019s public filings, and an enterprise value to NTM EBITDA multiple\nreference range of 11.5x to 16.5x to Hillrom management\u2019s estimates of Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period\nending June 30, 2022, as reflected in the Hillrom Projections, to calculate a range of implied enterprise values for\nHillrom. BofA Securities then calculated an implied equity value reference range per share of Hillrom common stock\n(rounded to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom by subtracting from the resulting ranges of implied enterprise values it\ncalculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021 (calculated as debt less cash, and pro forma for Hillrom\u2019s\nacquisition of Bardy Diagnostics, Inc.), as reflected in Hillrom\u2019s public filings, and dividing the result by a number of\nfully-diluted shares of Hillrom common stock outstanding (calculated on a treasury stock method basis, based on\ninformation provided by the management of Hillrom). This analysis indicated the following approximate implied\nequity value reference ranges per share of Hillrom common stock, as compared to the per share merger consideration:\nImplied Equity Value Reference Range \nper Share of Hillrom Common Stock\nLTM (6/30/2021)\nNTM (6/30/2022)\nPer Share Merger \nConsideration\n$104.25 - $141.75\n$90.50 - $141.50\n$156.00\nNo selected precedent transaction used in this analysis or the applicable business or target company is identical or\ndirectly comparable to Hillrom or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely\nmathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in\nfinancial and operating characteristics, market conditions and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other\nvalues of the companies or transactions to which Hillrom and the merger were compared.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\nBofA Securities performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Hillrom to calculate a range of implied present values\nper share of Hillrom common stock utilizing estimates of the standalone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows Hillrom\nwas expected to generate over the period from June 30, 2021 through September 30, 2031 based on the Hillrom\nProjections. BofA Securities calculated terminal values for Hillrom by applying a selected range of EBITDA exit\nmultiples of 10.0x to 15.0x, which were selected based on BofA Securities\u2019 professional judgment and experience, to\nestimates of the EBITDA Hillrom was expected to generate in the terminal year. The cash flows and\n43\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nthe terminal values were then discounted to present value as of June 30, 2021, utilizing the mid-year convention, and\nusing discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 9.0%, which were based on an estimate of Hillrom\u2019s weighted average cost\nof capital, derived using the capital asset pricing model. BofA Securities then calculated implied equity value\nreference ranges per share of Hillrom common stock (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom by subtracting from the\nresulting ranges of implied enterprise values it calculated the net debt of Hillrom as of June 30, 2021 (calculated as\ndebt less cash, and pro forma for Hillrom\u2019s acquisition of Bardy Diagnostics, Inc.), as reflected in Hillrom\u2019s public\nfilings, and dividing the result by a number of fully-diluted shares of Hillrom common stock outstanding (calculated\non a treasury stock method basis, based on information provided by the management of Hillrom). This analysis\nindicated the following approximate implied equity value reference range per share of Hillrom common stock (rounded\nto the nearest $0.25) for Hillrom, as compared to the per share merger consideration:\nImplied Equity Value Reference \nRange per Share of Hillrom \nCommon Stock\nPer Share Merger Consideration\n$130.50 - $208.25\n$156.00\nOther Factors\nBofA Securities also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Securities\u2019 financial\nanalyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things\nthe following:\n52-Week Trading Range. BofA Securities reviewed the trading range of the shares of Hillrom common stock for the\n52-week period ended July 27, 2021, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported that Hillrom and Baxter were\ndiscussing an acquisition of Hillrom by Baxter, which was $81.17 to $123.78, and for the 52-week period ended August\n30, 2021, which was $81.17 to $145.78.\nWall Street Analysts Unaffected Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed certain publicly available equity research\nanalyst price targets for the shares of Hillrom common stock available as of July 27, 2021, the day before The Wall\nStreet Journal reported that Hillrom and Baxter were discussing an acquisition of Hillrom by Baxter, and noted that the\nrange of such price targets (discounted by one (1) year at Hillrom\u2019s illustrative cost of equity of 9%) was $114.75 to\n$120.25.\nWall Street Analysts Current Price Targets. BofA Securities reviewed certain publicly available equity research\nanalyst price targets for the shares of Hillrom common stock available as of August 30, 2021, and noted that the range\nof such price targets (discounted by one (1) year at Hillrom\u2019s illustrative cost of equity of 9%) was $119.25 to $142.25.\nMiscellaneous\nAs noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section entitled \u201cSummary of Material Company Financial\nAnalyses\u201d represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Securities to the Hillrom\nBoard in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors\nconsidered by BofA Securities in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex\nanalytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial\nanalysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is\nnot readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Securities believes that its analyses\nsummarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Securities further believes that selecting portions of its\nanalyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all\nanalyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying BofA Securities\u2019 analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to\nin the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis\nreferred to in the summary.\nIn performing its analyses, BofA Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Hillrom. The estimates of the future\nperformance of Hillrom in or underlying BofA Securities analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or\nactual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by\nBofA Securities\u2019 analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Securities\u2019 analysis of the fairness,\n44\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nfrom a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of Hillrom common stock (other than holders of excluded\nshares) of the per share merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger and were provided to the\nHillrom Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Securities\u2019 opinion. The analyses do not purport to be\nappraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or acquired or the prices at which any\nsecurities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of\nvaluations resulting from, any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty\nand should not be taken to be BofA Securities\u2019 view of the actual values of Hillrom or its shares.\nThe type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between Hillrom\nand Baxter, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Hillrom Board. The decision to enter into\nthe merger agreement was solely that of the Hillrom Board. As described above, BofA Securities\u2019 opinion and\nanalyses were only one of many factors considered by the Hillrom Board in its evaluation of the merger and should\nnot be viewed as determinative of the views of the Hillrom Board, management or any other party with respect to the\nmerger or the per share merger consideration.\nHillrom has agreed to pay BofA Securities for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee of\napproximately $11 million, $1.5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and the remainder of which\nis contingent upon consummation of the merger. Hillrom also has agreed to reimburse BofA Securities for its\nexpenses incurred in connection with BofA Securities\u2019 engagement and to indemnify BofA Securities, any of its\naffiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents and each other person controlling BofA\nSecurities or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising\nout of BofA Securities\u2019 engagement.\nBofA Securities and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,\ncommodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well\nas providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial\nadvisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and\nindividuals.

        "Section Text": "Interests of Hillrom\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nIn considering the recommendation of the Hillrom Board to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement,\nHillrom shareholders should be aware that Hillrom\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that\nmay be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Hillrom shareholders generally. The Hillrom Board was aware\nof these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, in\nreaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement (including the merger), and in recommending to Hillrom shareholders that the merger agreement be\napproved. Such interests are described below. The merger will be a \u201cchange in control\u201d for purposes of the Hillrom\nexecutive compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.\nHillrom\u2019s executive officers who are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are John P.\nGroetelaars (President and Chief Executive Officer), Barbara Bodem (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial\nOfficer), Paul S. Johnson (Senior Vice President and President, Patient Support Systems), Andreas G. Frank (Senior\nVice President and President, Front Line Care) and Deborah M. Rasin (Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer\nand Secretary).

Wagner (Corporate Controller).\n48TABLE OF CONTENTS\nCertain Assumptions\nExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in\nthis section, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe relevant price per share of Hillrom common stock is $156.00, which is the per share merger\nconsideration\u037e\n\u2022\nThe effective time as referenced in this section occurs on September 27, 2021, which is the assumed date of\nthe effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each executive officer of Hillrom was terminated by Baxter without \u201ccause\u201d or due to\nthe executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and\nagreements), in either case immediately following the merger and on the assumed date of the effective time\nof September 27, 2021.\nThe amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be\naccurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described above, and do not reflect certain compensation\nactions that may occur before completion of the merger.\nTreatment of Outstanding Equity Awards\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, outstanding Hillrom\nequity-based awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes:\n\u2022\nEach outstanding Hillrom stock option will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of\nHillrom common stock underlying such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) (i) the\nexcess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price of such stock\noption, less applicable taxes. Each Hillrom stock option with a per share exercise price equal to or greater\nthan the per share merger consideration will be cancelled at the effective time with no consideration.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding Hillrom restricted stock unit award (a \u201cHillrom RSU Award\u201d) granted before the date of\nthe merger agreement and each outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger\nagreement to Hillrom\u2019s non-employee directors will become fully vested and be automatically cancelled and\nconverted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of\nHillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time and (y)\nthe per share merger consideration, less applicable taxes.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding Hillrom RSU Award granted on or after the date of the merger agreement excluding any\nsuch Hillrom RSU Award granted to a non-employee director (a \u201cPost-Signing Hillrom RSU Award\u201d) will be\nconverted automatically into a Baxter restricted stock unit award with respect to the number of shares of\nBaxter common stock determined by multiplying: (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock subject\nto such Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Award immediately prior to the effective time by (y) the quotient\nobtained by dividing (A) the per share merger consideration by (B) the per share average closing price of\nBaxter common stock for the consecutive period of ten (10) trading days immediately preceding (but not\nincluding) the last trading date prior to the closing date. Such converted award will otherwise continue on\nthe same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Hillrom RSU Award, including any provisions\nfor acceleration of vesting. Such terms and conditions include \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d protection of the converted\naward, meaning that if the employment of the holder (including any executive officer) is terminated by the\nsurviving corporation without \u201ccause\u201d or due to the executive officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in\neach case, on or within two years (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three years) following a change in\ncontrol of Hillrom, all such Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Awards then held by such executive officer would\nfully vest upon such termination of employment.\n\u2022\nEach outstanding Hillrom performance-based restricted stock unit award (a \u201cHillrom PRSU Award\u201d) will\nbecome fully vested and be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount\nequal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Hillrom common stock underlying such Hillrom PRSU\nAward immediately prior to the effective time based on a payout percentage of 146% (in the case of such\naward granted in Hillrom\u2019s 2020 fiscal year) or 187.5% (in the case of such award granted in Hillrom\u2019s 2021\nfiscal year) and (y) the per share merger consideration, less applicable taxes.\n49\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSee the section entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Merger\u201d beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement for an estimate of the value of each of\nHillrom\u2019s named executive officer\u2019s unvested Hillrom equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above\nunder \u201c-Certain Assumptions\u201d, the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable at the effective time to\nHillrom\u2019s three executive officers who are not named executive officers in respect of their unvested Hillrom equity\nawards granted prior to the date of the merger agreement is as follows: unvested Hillrom stock options-$1,345,578\u037e\nunvested Hillrom RSU Awards-$1,643,683\u037e and unvested Hillrom PRSU Awards-$4,162,946 (based on the estimated\nactual payout percentage for awards granted in Hillrom\u2019s fiscal year 2019 and the payout percentage specified in the\nmerger agreement for awards granted in Hillrom\u2019s fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021). As of the assumed effective\ndate of September 27, 2021, no Post-Signing Hillrom RSU Awards were held by such executive officers. Hillrom RSU\nAwards held by Hillrom\u2019s non-employee directors are fully vested at the time of grant by their terms.\nOfficer Change in Control Agreements\nHillrom has entered into change in control agreements (each, a \u201cCIC Agreement\u201d) with each of its executive officers.\nUnder the CIC Agreement, each Hillrom executive officer will be eligible for severance benefits upon a termination of\nemployment by Hillrom without \u201ccause,\u201d or a resignation by the executive officer for \u201cgood reason,\u201d in either case,\non or within two years following a change in control of Hillrom (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three years), or\nwithin three months prior to a change in control if the termination occurs in connection with such change in control,\nsubject to such executive officer\u2019s execution and non-revocation of a separation and release agreement. Pursuant to\nsuch separation and release agreement, each executive officer is required to affirm and acknowledge the continued\napplication of the restrictive covenants provided in his or her employment agreement (in the case of Mr. Groetelaars,\nas modified by the separation and release agreement to reflect a 12-month post-termination restricted period), which\nare specifically incorporated by reference into the separation and release agreement, including a non-compete and a\nnon-solicitation of customers and employees, in each case, that applies during the 12-month period following\ntermination of employment.\nThe severance benefits under each CIC Agreement are (i) cash severance equal to two times (or in the case of Mr.\nGroetelaars, three times) the sum of the executive officer\u2019s (x) annual base salary in effect immediately before the\nchange in control or immediately before the date of termination, whichever is greater and (y) target bonus for the year\nof termination (in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, no less than 100% of base salary)\u037e (ii) a prorated annual bonus payment\nbased on actual performance through the end of the year of termination\u037e and (iii) continuation of health and medical\ninsurance coverage and group term life insurance program for up to two years (or in the case of Mr. Groetelaars, three\nyears).\nIn connection with entering into the merger agreement, on September 1, 2021, the Hillrom board of directors amended\nthe CIC Agreements to provide the executive officers with the right to receive a make-whole payment in the event\nthat any payments or benefits provided to such executive officers in connection with the merger become subject to\nthe excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The payments would generally place the\nexecutive officers in the same after-tax position that they would have been in if the excise tax did not apply to them,\nand do not cover ordinary income taxes due on the payments and benefits giving rise to the excise tax. These make-\nwhole rights are provided solely in connection with the merger and therefore the amendments will be automatically\nrevoked if the merger agreement is terminated without the consummation of the merger.\nSee the section entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Merger\u201d beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement for the estimated amounts that each of\nHillrom\u2019s named executive officers would receive under their CIC Agreements upon a qualifying termination of\nemployment following a change in control of Hillrom. Based on the assumptions described above under \u201c-Certain\nAssumptions,\u201d the estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance payments (including a prorated annual cash\nincentive award, the actual performance for which is assumed to equal target performance for purposes of this\nquantification) and make-whole payments that Hillrom\u2019s three executive officers who are not named executive officers\nwould receive under their CIC Agreements upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in\ncontrol of Hillrom is $4,595,891 and $3,256,006, respectively.\nTreatment of Annual Bonus\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement and confidential disclosure schedules, Hillrom may provide to each Hillrom\nemployee who is eligible to participate in a Hillrom annual bonus program, including each executive officer,\n50\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\na prorated portion of the annual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the closing that occurs prior to the\nclosing, which bonus will be determined based on the greater of (i) the employee\u2019s target annual bonus for such year\nand (ii) the employee\u2019s annual bonus amount for such year determined based on (A) actual performance results\nthrough the last completed fiscal quarter prior to the closing and (B) forecast performance results for the remaining\nfiscal quarters and assuming an individual performance multiplier of 100%. Such prorated bonus payment would be\nprovided without duplication of any prorated bonus payment payable under an applicable severance plan or\nagreement, including a CIC Agreement.\nSee the section entitled \u201cQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom\u2019s Named Executive Officers in\nConnection with the Merger\u201d beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement for the estimated amount of the prorated\nbonus payment that each of Hillrom\u2019s named executive officers would receive under the terms of the merger\nagreement. Assuming that the effective time occurs on September 27, 2021, the estimated aggregate amount of the\nprorated bonus payments (the actual performance for which is assumed to equal target performance for purposes of\nthis quantification) that Hillrom\u2019s three executive officers who are not named executive officers would receive under\nthe terms of the merger agreement is $707,096.\nPotential Employment Arrangements with Baxter\nAny of Hillrom\u2019s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide\nservices to Baxter or the surviving corporation may, prior to, on, or following the closing, enter into new\nindividualized compensation arrangements with Baxter or the surviving corporation and may participate in cash or\nequity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Baxter or the surviving corporation. As of the date of this proxy\nstatement, no new individualized compensation arrangements between Hillrom\u2019s executive officers and Baxter or the\nsurviving corporation have been established.\nIndemnification and Insurance\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Hillrom\u2019s non-employee directors and executive officers will be\nentitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies\nfollowing the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled \u201cThe\nMerger-Directors\u2019 and Officers\u2019 Indemnification and Insurance\u201d beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement.\nQuantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Hillrom\u2019s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the\nMerger\nThe information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC\u2019s Regulation S-K, which\nrequires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Hillrom that is\nbased on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits\ndescribed below, see the discussion under the caption \u201cInterests of Hillrom\u2019s Directors and Executive Officers in the\nMerger\u201d above.\nThe amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually\noccur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the\ntable, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the merger. For purposes\nof calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:\n\u2022\nThe relevant price per share of Hillrom common stock is $156.00, which is the per share merger\nconsideration\u037e\n\u2022\nThe effective time as referenced in this section occurs on September 27, 2021, which is the assumed date of\nthe effective time solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section\u037e and\n\u2022\nThe employment of each named executive officer of Hillrom was terminated by the surviving corporation\nwithout \u201ccause\u201d or due to the officer\u2019s resignation for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as such terms are defined in the\nrelevant plans and agreements), in either case immediately following the effective time and on the assumed\ndate of the effective time of September 27, 2021.\n51\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nNamed Executive \nOfficer(1)\nCash ($)\n(1)\nEquity($)(2)\nPerquisites / \nBenefits($)(3)\nTax \nReimbursement\n($)(4)\nTotal ($)\nJohn P.

After the expiration of the initial waiting period (or the re-started initial waiting period), the\nAntitrust Division of the DOJ or the FTC may issue a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material\n(a \u201cSecond Request\u201d). If a Second Request is issued, the parties may not complete the merger until they substantially\ncomply with the Second Request and observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, unless the waiting period is\nterminated earlier, or the parties commit not to close for some additional period of time.
